What evidence exists for temporal variability in Arctic terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity throughout the Holocene? A systematic map protocol.
===

Welcome to the working respository for full-text screening and data coding for our systematic map.

We are using a custom-designed app to conduct data coding. In this repository, you will find the following:

* **A file-based graph database in ```/data```.** The file-based structure allows for data coders to commit their changes every so often and resolve any conflicts between the coders.

* **The ready-to-run application in ```/dist```.** The app is compiled for macOS (Intel binary) and Windows.

To perform coding, the following steps are required:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account (if you don't have one)

2. Get added as a collaborator to the repository AndrewIOM/holocene-arctic-biodiversity-map

3. Download the GitHub Desktop app and clone the repository to a local folder.

4. To test out the functionality, switch to the 'test' branch in the github app.

5. To run the data coding software, look in the 'dist' folder of the repository in the macos and windows folders to find the appropriate app. When running the app, you need to paste in the directory path for where the 'data' folder is. On macos you can right click a folder in finder while holding the option key to get the option to 'copy path'. Similar happens on windows with ctrl or alt (can't remember which).

6. To code for real, switch to the 'main' branch in the github app and get coding. Commit and push changes every so often.
