What evidence exists for temporal variability in Arctic terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity throughout the Holocene? A systematic map protocol.
===

Welcome to the working respository for full-text screening and data coding for our systematic map.

We are using a custom-designed app to conduct data coding. In this repository, you will find the following:

* **A file-based graph database in ```/data```.** The file-based structure allows for data coders to commit their changes every so often and resolve any conflicts between the coders.

* **The ready-to-run application in ```/dist```.** The app is compiled for macOS (Intel binary) and Windows.
