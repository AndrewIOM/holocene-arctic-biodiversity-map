0,"Abrupt Holocene climate transitions in the northern North Atlantic region recorded by synchronized lacustrine records in Iceland | Two high-sediment-accumulation-rate Icelandic lakes, the glacial lake Hvitarvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn, contain numerous tephra layers of known age, which together with high-resolution paleomagnetic secular variations allow synchronization with a well-dated marine core from the shelf north of Iceland. A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), delta C-13, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially similar to 5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 43 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 02 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North Atlantic.

1,"Abrupt climatic events during the last glacial-interglacial transition in Alaska | Evidence is mounting that abrupt climatic shifts occurred during the last glacial-interglacial transition (LGIT) in the North Atlantic and other regions. However, few high-resolution climatic records of the LGIT exist from the high latitudes of the North Pacific rim. We analyzed lake sediments from southwestern Alaska for biogenic silica, organic carbon, organic nitrogen, diatom assemblages, and compound-specific hydrogen isotopes. Results reveal climatic changes coincident with the Younger Dryas, Intra-Aller√∏d Cold Period, and Pre-Boreal Oscillation. However, major discrepancies exist in the paleoclimate patterns of the B√∏lling-Aller√∏d interstadial between our data and the GISP2 Œ¥18O record from Greenland, and causes are uncertain. These data suggest that the North Pacific and North Atlantic experienced similar reversals during climatic warming of the LGIT but that the B√∏lling-Aller√∏d cooling trend in the GISP2 Œ¥18O record is probably not a hemispheric or global pattern.

2,"Were abrupt Lateglacial and early-Holocene climatic changes in northwest Europe linked to freshwater outbursts to the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans? | During the Lateglacial and early Holocene, abrupt, millennial-scale climatic variations are recorded in a wide range of high-resolution proxy records from marine and terrestrial archives in NW Europe. Our review of the evidence for these rapid climate events do not show an apparent link to possible forcing factors such as long-term, orbitally induced variations in solar radiation, short-term variations in solar activity as inferred from C-14, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, or volcanic sulphate as recorded in the GISP2 ice-core record. There is, however, a remarkable degree of similarity with the number, duration and timing of episodes of increased flux of fresh water to the north Atlantic and Arctic Oceans from the Laurentide ice sheet and from the Baltic ice lake in SW Sweden. These freshwater outburst events occurred when continental runoff from the Laurentide ice sheet was rerouted from the Mississippi River to the Hudson River, St Lawrence River, Hudson Strait and along the Mackenzie River to the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and when the Baltic ice lake in SW Sweden drained to Skagerrak. Periods of increased freshwater flow to the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans may thus provide a mechanism to explain the abrupt and significant Lateglacial and early-Holocene climate events in NW Europe. The idea that freshwater outbursts might drive abrupt climate events is not new, but previous work may have underestimated the extent of support from proxy data and overestimated the influence of the Laurentide ice sheet. | ['bakke', 'dahl', 'nesje'] | ","['bakke', 'dahl', 'nesje']",2
3,"Age of Landslides Along the Grande Riviere De La Baleine Estuary Eastern Coast of Hudson Bay Quebec Canada | A 12 km long terrace along the estuary of the Grande Riviere de la Baleine, northern Quebec (55 .degree. 17'N, 77.degree. 47'W), has been locally modified by seven large landslides during the last 3,200 14C years. The oldest undated landslide occurred between 3,200 B.P. (formation of the upper terrace) and 2,200 B.P., i.e. the radiocarbon age of the second oldest landslide. The third one occurred around 900 B.P. sometime before peat started to accumulate on the flowbowl floor. The more recent landslides were dendrochronologically dated. They were formed in less than 30 years, i.e. in 1818 (2 synchronous landslides), 1839 and 1846 A.D. These 19th-century landslides were dated through a comparative analysis of growth curves derived from buried trees found in the flowing sediments or from tilted and cut trees, with the regional master chronologies and the northern Quebec light-ring chronology, using more specifically the 1816 and 1817 light-ring years. The 1818 landslides occurred during the growing season (July), whereas the 1839 and 1846 landslides were formed during spring. The occurrence of numerous landslides during this short period seems to be related to sustained cool and humid climatic conditions that may have enhanced the subsoil water content. | ['begin', 'filion'] | ","['begin', 'filion']",2
4,"Aller√∏d-Younger Dryas lake temperatures from midge fossils in Atlantic Canada | Remains of freshwater midges are abundant in lake sediments, and their species distributions are closely related to the surface-water temperature of lakes; their distributions thus provide a powerful tool for paleoclimatology. The distribution of species m a core from Splan Pond in Atlantic Canada indicates that there were abrupt transitions in late-glacial temperatures between warm and cold states. The transitions are correlative with the well-known warm Aller√∏d and cold Younger Dryas events in Europe. These data thus confirm the inference from palynological data that these events affected regions on both sides of the Atlantic. | ['mott', 'smol', 'walker'] | ","['mott', 'smol', 'walker']",4
5,"Alpine glaciers and permanent ice and snow patches in western Canada approach their smallest sizes since the mid-Holocene, consistent with global trends | Most alpine glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere reached their maximum extents of the Holocene between ad 1600 and 1850. Since the late 1800s, however, glaciers have thinned and retreated, mainly because of atmospheric warming. Glacier retreat in western Canada and other regions is exposing subfossil tree stumps, soils and plant detritus that, until recently, were beneath tens to hundreds of metres of ice. In addition, human artefacts and caribou dung are emerging from permanent snow patches many thousands of years after they were entombed. Dating of these materials indicates that many of these glaciers and snow patches are smaller today than at any time in the past several thousand years. This evidence, in turn, suggests that glacier recession in the 20th century is unprecedented during the past several millennia and that glaciers in western Canada have reached minimum extents only 150-300 years after they achieved their maximum Holocene extents. | ['clague', 'koch', 'osborn'] | ","['clague', 'koch', 'osborn']",1
6,"The Amphi-Atlantic Oscillation - a Proposed Late-Glacial Climatic Event | Numerous palaeoclimatic records from Europe, Greenland and the North Atlantic Ocean provide evidence for a short-term cooling event which preceded the Younger Dryas stadial of ca. 11-10 ka BP. The discovery of a similar event in eastern North America, the Killarney Oscillation (KO), raised the possibility of a single pre-Younger Dryas cooling event that affected the entire North Atlantic seaboard. This paper reviews evidence for the KO and other pre-Younger Dryas events and discusses the basis for their correlation. The informal name 'Amphi-Atlantic Oscillation' is proposed as a collective term for the KO and events that correlate with it. | ['cwynar', 'levesque', 'mayle', 'walker'] | ","['cwynar', 'levesque', 'mayle', 'walker']",4
7,"Back to the future: Global warming | Evidence from the past, for example in ice cores and fossils, can tell us what happened to plants and animals during historic periods of climate change. This article looks at what we can learn from the past and how we might use this knowledge to conserve our natural environment. Approximately 10,000 years ago, the Earth emerged from the last ice age (the Pleistocene) as the climate began to warm up. (See Glossary for definition of terms.) Only recently have scientists discovered the speed of this ancient 'global warming' event. Evidence from the Greenland ice sheet suggests that at that time temperatures rose by 7¬∞C in just 50 years (see Figure 1). This is even more rapid than the global warming predictions for the next century (+2¬∞C by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Although the causes of the earlier event were natural and therefore different from the present human-induced global warming, the environmental responses of 10,000 years ago can help us to predict the consequences of future climate change. This is important for the successful conservation of endangered species which may be unable to survive rapid climate change. | ['woodland'] | ",['woodland'],4
8,"Beach Ridge Geomorphology at Cape Grinnell, northern Greenland: A Less Icy Arctic in the Mid-Holocene | In northern Greenland, the Cape Grinnell beach ridge plain offers a 9,000 year multi-proxy record for isostatic recovery, storm history, and the hydrological changes related to precipitation and slope evolution. The chronology of uplifted beach ridges is constrained by ten geological 14C ages on shell and sea mammal bones and eleven upper limiting ages from archaeological sites that span the last 3,000 years. Beach ridges formed under the influence of open water storms with renewed frequency and intensity ca. 3 ka and 1 ka ago. A lack of shell may reflect cooler sea surface temperatures. The presence and absence of ice can be inferred by push-features. Three intervals of heightened precipitation produced extensive fan deltas: (a) after 9 ka BP (b) prior to 4.5 ka BP and (c) during the Little Ice Age (AD 1350-1900). Active solifluction lobes and colluvia cover beach ridge deposits that are between 9 and 7 ka old. | ['mason'] | ",['mason'],1
9,"A biogenic-silica delta18O record of climatic change during the last glacial-interglacial transition in southwestern Alaska | Despite growing evidence for environmental oscillations during the last glacial-interglacial transition from high latitude, terrestrial sites of the North Pacific rim, oxygen-isotopic records of these oscillations remain sparse. The lack of data is due partially to the paucity of lakes that contain carbonate sediment suitable for oxygen-isotopic analysis. We report here the first record of oxygen-isotopic composition in diatom silica (delta18OSi) from a lake in that region. delta18OSi increases gradually from 19.0 to 23.5permill between 12,340 and 11,000 14C yr B.P., reflecting marked climatic warming at the end of the last glaciation. Around 11,000 14C yr B.P., delta18OSi decreases by 1.7permill, suggesting a temperature decrease of 3.5-8.9degreeC at the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) in southwestern Alaska. Climatic recovery began ca. 10,740 14C yr B.P., as inferred from the increase of delta18OSi to a maximum of 23.9permill near the end of the YD. Our data reveal that a YD climatic reversal in southwestern coastal areas of Alaska occurred, but the YD climate did not return to full-glacial conditions. | ['hu', 'shemesh'] | ","['hu', 'shemesh']",1
10,"Biogeochemical evidence for hydrologic changes during the Holocene in a lake sediment record from southeast Greenland | Holocene paleoclimate records from Greenland help us understand the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet and regional oceanic and atmospheric circulation systems to natural climate variability in order to place recent changes in a longer-term perspective. Here biogeochemical analysis of a lake sediment core from southeast Greenland is used to define changes in moisture balance and runoff during the Holocene in a catchment near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. A 1.6 m sediment core that spans the last 8.8 ka was recovered from Flower Valley Lake on Ammassalik Island. Magnetic susceptibility, diatoms, bulk biogeochemical properties (TOC, C/N, C-13(org)), and lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes; C-16-C-31) reveal changes in clastic sedimentation and the relative input of terrestrial- and aquatic-derived organic matter. Hydrogen isotope values (D) of mid- (n-C-25) and long-chain (n-C-29, n-C-31) n-alkanes allow reconstruction of D of precipitation and summertime evaporation of lake water. Following a period of early lake ontogeny and landscape stabilization after deglaciation from 8.4 to 7.0 ka, the mid Holocene, 8.4-4.1 ka, is characterized by greater evaporative enrichment of the lake water as indicated by D records. After 4.1 ka, there is a decrease in evaporative enrichment of the lake water. There is also an abrupt transition to more variable sedimentation marked by sharp increases in magnetic susceptibility, C/N, C-13(org), and the concentration of long-chain n-alkanes, showing periodic delivery of terrestrial organic matter and clastic sediment to the lake. Higher insolation during the mid Holocene resulted in a warmer and drier climate with longer ice-free periods in the summer and enhanced evaporation of lake water. The reduction in insolation and colder temperatures during the late Holocene caused a reduction in evaporation of lake water over the last 4.1 ka and was accompanied by periodic increases in surface runoff, which correspond with intervals of cold Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures. | ['balascio', 'bradley', 'dandrea', 'perren'] | ","['balascio', 'bradley', 'dandrea', 'perren']",2
11,"Biostratigraphic evidence of the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Preboreal oscillation in northern Iceland | Basal sediments of Lake Torfadalsvatn, northern Iceland, record changes in terrestrial and limnic environments in the period 11,300-9000 C-14 yr B.P. These changes were probably forced by climate and connected with displacements of the marine polar front and sea-ice margin. Pollen, spores, green algae (Pediastrum), saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, and carbon content of the basal sediments provide the first detailed biostratigraphic record of the last glacial-interglacial transition in Iceland. During the first pioneer phase, beginning at ca. 11,300 C-14 yr B.P., grasses and fell-field herbs became established, and lake productivity was very low. At ca. 10,900 C-14 yr B.P., climatic and soil conditions became favorable for shrubs and dwarf shrubs. This change, together with increased limnic productivity, clearly indicates long seasons without ice-cover in the sea immediately north of Iceland. A return to a colder climate (Younger Dryas), probably in connection with a southward displacement of the marine polar front, occurred by 10,600 C-14 yr B.P. Shrub and dwarf-shrub vegetation disappeared, and limnic productivity diminished. A second pioneer vegetation phase, dominated by Oxyria/Rumex and grasses, was initiated by a change to longer seasons without sea ice at ca. 9900 C-14 yr B.P. This warming is also evident as a contemporaneous increase in lake productivity. After ca. 9400 C-14 yr B.P. the reestablishment of dwarf-shrub heaths and very high limnic productivity indicate further warming. (C) 1995 University of Washington. | ['rundgren'] | ",['rundgren'],4
12,"Characterization of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age and recent warming in northern Lapland | The major climate events of the Common Era (CE) have global imprints but significant variations in their timing and magnitude have been suggested. For reliable assessments of the past climate patterns and their applications for evaluations of the ongoing changes, spatially comprehensive network of high-fidelity paleorecords are necessary. In this study, we reconstruct summer air temperatures of the past 2000 years from northern Lapland (Utsjoki, Finland). We use fossil Chironomidae (Diptera) assemblages from sediments of a remote subarctic lake (Loazzejavri) and the transfer function approach for quantitative temperature reconstruction. The results indicate that the Chironomidae fauna were responding to air temperature and the core assemblages had good modern analogues in the calibration set allowing reliable paleoclimate reconstruction. In our reconstruction, a warm period between similar to 900 and 1300 CE is synchronous with the globally defined extent of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), though beginning considerably later than previously reconstructed for eastern Scandinavia. The MCA was also relatively mild, as the temperatures were only 0.5 degrees C higher than the record average. Similar to eastern Scandinavia, a cold period corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA) was longer that typically observed in hemispheric reconstructions beginning already at similar to 1400 CE and lasting very close to modern times. We also found confirming evidence that the LIA was interrupted by a short-lived warmer period dividing it into two separate cold events in the region. Based on our results, the present is warmer than during any time of the MCA displaying how rapid and severe the ongoing climate change is. | ['kivila', 'luoto', 'nevalainen', 'rantala'] | ","['kivila', 'luoto', 'nevalainen', 'rantala']",2

14,"Chironomid-inferred air temperatures from Lateglacial and Holocene sites in north-west Europe: progress and problems | Non-biting midges (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are now widely recognised as powerful biological proxies for inferring past climatic change. In this paper the response of chironomid assemblages to Lateglacial and Holocene climatic change from sites in Scotland and Norway is discussed. Analyses have shown that midge assemblages have responded to major and minor climatic fluctuations during the last 15,000 yr, such as the Aegelsee Oscillation, Gerzensee Oscillation and Younger Dryas in the Lateglacial, and the thermal optimum, ""Little Ice Age"" and cooling events at 8.2 and 2.0 cal ka BP in the Holocene. In an attempt to quantify these and other climatic fluctuations a chironomid-mean July air temperature inference model. based on a modern calibration set of 109 lakes in Norway and Svalbard. has been developed. The 3-component weighted averaging partial least squares inference model performs well with a root mean squared error of prediction of 0.90 degreesC and a maximum bias of 0.59 degreesC (both based on leave-one-out cross-validation) which is lower than chironomid-temperature inference models developed in Canada, Switzerland and Finland. However, while temperature-inference models perform well in the Lateglacial, the more subtle climatic changes of the Holocene are more difficult to reconstruct because the likely temperature changes are close to the limits of the prediction errors of the existing models. To address this problem, future work is required to refine and develop the calibration set by further improving taxonomic resolution, by adding more lakes to the calibration set and by investigating the influence of other environmental variables on chironomid distributions and abundances.

16,"Chironomids as a tool for inferring Holocene climate: an assessment based on six sites in southern Scandinavia | Chironomid subfossil assemblages from six low-alpine and sub-alpine Holocene stratigraphies are presented and compared. They are from five lakes in mid-southern and western Norway and one in central Sweden. When comparing the chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, there are many time segments with a poor among-lake fit in inferred temperatures. Possible environmental variables influencing the fossil chironomid assemblages are discussed using a modern Norwegian calibration data set to indicate taxon-environment relationships. These analyses indicate that local changes in pH, water chemistry, and productivity at times may have overridden the regional temperature signal. In addition, other causes of poor among-site temperature fit are discussed, in particular those related to chronological uncertainties. Holocene temperature inferences from single cores based on chironomids may not always be able to provide a reliable regional temperature signal, but can act as a guide from which hypotheses about past environmental conditions can be tested with the aid of chironomid-inferred temperatures from several sites and from other environmental proxies. We have obtained a regional picture of Holocene summer temperature change by developing a consensus reconstruction based on the overall temperature signal from all six sites. This consensus is developed by fitting a smoother through all 330 site-specific temperature-deviations from the Holocene mean. The consensus temperature deviations vary from -0.8 degrees C at 8800 cal years BP to +0.8 degrees C at 6500 cal years BP. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

17,"Chronology of the last deglaciation and Holocene environmental changes in the Sisimiut area, SW Greenland based on lacustrine records | The Sisimiut area was deglaciated in the early Holocene, c. 11?cal.?ka BP. At that time the lowlands were inundated by the sea, but the isostatic rebound surpassed the global sea-level rise, and the lowlands emerged from the sea. The pioneer vegetation in the area consisted of mosses and herbaceous plants. The oldest remains of woody plants (Empetrum nigrum) are dated to c. 10.3?cal.?ka BP, and remains of Salix herbacea and Harrimanella hypnoides are found in slightly younger sediments. The maximum occurrence of statoblasts of the bryozoan Plumatella repens from c.?10 to 4.5?cal.?ka BP probably reflects the Holocene thermal maximum, which is also indicated in geochemical proxies of the lake sediments. A maximum in organic matter accumulation in one of the three studied lakes c. 3?cal.?ka BP can probably be ascribed to a late Holocene short-duration temperature maximum or a period of increased aridity. Cenococcum geophilum sclerotia are common in the late Holocene, implying increased soil erosion during the Neoglaciation. A comparison with sediment and macrofossil records from inland shows similar Holocene trends and a similar immigration history. It also reveals that there has been a significant gradient throughout the Holocene, from an oceanic and stable climate at the outer coast to a more continental and unstable climate with warmer summers and drier conditions close to the margin of the Greenland ice sheet, where the buffer capacity of the sea is lower. | ['bennike', 'wagner'] | ","['bennike', 'wagner']",2
18,"Holocene climate conditions in central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia) inferred from sediment composition and fossil chironomids of Lake Temje | A 380 cm long sediment core from Lake Temje (central Yakutia, Eastern Siberia) was studied to infer Holocene palaeoenvironmental change in the extreme periglacial setting of eastern Siberia during the last 10,000 years. Data on sediment composition were used to characterize changes in the depositional environment during the ontogenetic development of the Lake Temje. The analysis of fossil chironomid remains and statistical treatment of chironomid data by the application of a newly developed regional Russian transfer functions provided inferences of mean July air temperatures (TJuly) and water depths (WD). Reconstructed WDs show minor changes throughout the core and range between 80 and 120 cm. All the fluctuations in reconstructed water depth lie within the mean error of prediction of the inference model (RMSEP = 0.35) so it is not possible to draw conclusions from the reconstructions. A qualitative and quantitative reconstruction of Holocene climate in central Yakutia recognized three stages of palaeoenvironmental changes. The early Holocene between 10 and 8 ka BP was characterized by colder-than-today and moist summer conditions. Cryotextures in the lake sediments document full freezing of the lake water during the winter time. A general warming trend started around 8.0 ka BP in concert with enhanced biological productivity. Reconstructed mean TJuly were equal or up to 1.5 [degree]C higher than today between 6.0 ka and 5.0 ka BP. During the entire late Holocene after 4.8 ka BP, reconstructed mean TJuly remained below modern value. Limnological conditions did not change significantly. The inference of a mid-Holocene climate optimum supports scenarios of Holocene climatic changes in the subpolar part of eastern Siberia and indicates climate teleconnections to the North Atlantic realm.

19,"Holocene climate conditions and glacier variation in central Iceland from physical modelling and empirical evidence | Lacustrine sediment cores from proglacial lake Hvitarvatn, central Iceland, reveal a detailed chronology of Holocene sedimentation, from which environmental conditions and the attendant fluctuations of Langjokull ice cap have been interpreted. We apply a numerical ice-sheet model to determine the climatic conditions under which the empirical reconstruction is glaciologically plausible. Modelling constraints are derived from core records of diatom concentration, benthic diatom fraction, and ice-rafted debris occurrence, as well as lake bottom morphology and the present-day ice-cap geometry. Holocene simulations driven by the NGRIP delta O-18 record that are consistent with the empirical constraints show the most extensive advance of Langjokull ice cap to be its most recent, beginning somewhere between 5 and 3 ka BP. Ice advance in response to the 8.2 ka BP cold event is followed by several thousand years of nearly ice-free conditions in the mid-Holocene. All simulations suggest that the maximum Holocene stand of the ice cap occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA); those consistent with the constraints show little to no ice advance into Hvitarvatn before similar to 1 ka BP and indicate the lake area occupied by ice was much greater during the LIA than at any previous time. The most plausible simulation results were obtained for a maximum Holocene warming of 3-4 degrees C relative to the 1961-1990 reference, twice the Arctic average, and for Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) precipitation amounts comparable to or slightly greater than the modern. Reconciling the simulated subglacial discharge record to the empirically derived sediment volumes and emplacement times requires mean Holocene sediment concentrations of 0.8-1.6 kg m(-3). These estimates increase to 1.4-2.0 kg m(-3) when sedimentation rates are highest.

20,"Climate driven declines in terrestrial input over the middle and late Holocene of perched boreal lakes in northeast Ontario (Canada) and teleconnections to the North Atlantic | The landscape of northeast Ontario, Canada, is dominated by glacial and postglacial landforms including numerous boreal lakes that formed following the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and Glacial Lake Ojibway. This study uses micro-X-Ray Fluorescence elemental analysis to examine changes in sediment cores from two boreal lakes from northeast Ontario with the goal of inferring changes in terrestrial inputs and redox status of these lakes over the middle to late Holocene. These headwater lakes were selected as they have small watersheds that minimizes the complexity of hydrological responses, and as they are relatively proximal (similar to 130 km distance between lakes) to allow the detection of regional signals related to changes in climate over the Holocene. Strong correlations between Si, K, Ca, and Ti in Hogback Lake and Green Lake cores suggest that these elements represent proxies of terrestrial input. Standardized composite trends of these elements were very similar between the two lakes and were combined to represent a regional signal, with the highest terrestrial inputs between similar to 6000 and similar to 4000 cal yr BP, that subsequently declined through the Holocene. These results suggest that regional patterns in terrestrial input are linked to changes in hydroclimate and likely increased terrestrial stability over the middle to late Holocene. These composite trends are compared to similar geochemical composite trends from Iceland suggesting climate teleconnections between northeast North America and the North Atlantic. Cool conditions in the North Atlantic result in increased soil erosion in Iceland and correspond to cool and dry conditions in boreal northeast Ontario with corresponding low inputs of terrestrial material, and vice versa, over multidecadal time scales over the middle to late Holocene.

21,"Climate changes in East Europe and Siberia at the late glacial-holocene transition | The main climatic oscillations of the Lateglacial/Early Holocene (Allerod, Younger Dryas, and Preboreal) can be distinguished all over Eastern Europe and Siberia, Distribution of the main climatic indices in the Lategglacial Early Holocene. from west to east in Northern Eurasia, shows that variations of the mean January temperature (t(Jan)(o)) were larger. than those of July temperature (t(July)(o)) As at present t(Jan)(o) decreased to the east, while the deviations from the present-day values were greater in the west. During the Younger Dryas the seasonality of climate increased considerably, especially in the western (European) part of the studied area. The greatest negative temperature deviations from the present-day values (up to -14 degreesC) occurred in the northwestern part of the East European Plain. near the Scandinavian ice-sheet. It can be explained by a cooling influence from the remaining large ice body. Accordingly with degradation of the ice-sheet at the warmer intervals of the Lateglacial and Early Holocene, the regional differences in temperature deviations became smaller (up to 8degreesC). On the whole, precipitation (P) decreased in an easterly direction, though its deviations from the modern level varied for different time-intervals. During the Younger Dryas, P amounted to 60-65% of the present-day values in the East European Plain. 80% in central West Siberia. and only 50 in central Yakutia. For the entire Northern Eurasia, P did not exceed 300-350 mm/yr (in Yakutia it was only 100 mm/yr), levels typical for present-day dry steppe and semidesert zones. Nevertheless. the reconstructed changes of the main climatic indexes were proportional to the present-day climatic characteristics, so that the general tendencies of their contemporary distribution in the mid-latitudes were preserved during the entire Lateglacial Early Holocene interval. This shows that the general circulation of the atmosphere and geographical distribution of the main Highs and Lows in the studied time-interval were in essence similar to the present-day ones. Boundaries of permafrost in Lateglacial and Earl Holocene migrated in response to climate changes. The southern limit of permafrost during the Allerod was at 60degreesN in East Europe and 55degreesN in West Siberia. During the Younger Dryas it moved south to 50-52degreesN in East Europe, and parabolic sand dunes were formed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

22,"Climate and environmental history at Lake Levinson-Lessing, Taymyr Peninsula, during the last 62 kyr | The 45.95 m-long sediment succession shown in core Co1401 from Lake Levinson-Lessing allows the reconstruction of the largely unexplored environmental and climatic history of the Taymyr Peninsula of the past 62 kyr. The core was analysed with a multidisciplinary approach including lithological, granulometric, geochemical and pollen analyses. The proxy data indicate a relatively stable, herb-dominated environment with only subtle changes between a cold/wet late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4 and early MIS 3, mild/dry middle and late MIS 3 and a cold/dry MIS 2. The absence of pronounced climate fluctuations demonstrates that the Lake Levinson-Lessing catchment was not covered by an ice sheet during this period. Changes in precipitation were likely caused by waxing and waning of the large Eurasian ice sheets outside of the Taymyr Peninsula, which changed the eastward moisture transport and atmospheric circulation patterns. MIS 1 at Lake Levinson-Lessing was associated with overall warmer and wetter conditions and short-term climate fluctuations during the Bolling-Allerod warming, Younger Dryas cooling and Preboreal transition, which indicates the influence of North Atlantic air masses. | ['andreev', 'fedorov', 'gromig', 'krastel', 'lebas', 'lenz', 'lenz', 'melles', 'scheidt', 'wagner'] | ","['andreev', 'fedorov', 'gromig', 'krastel', 'lebas', 'lenz', 'lenz', 'melles', 'scheidt', 'wagner']",2
23,"The climate of Europe during the Holocene: a gridded pollen-based reconstruction and its multi-proxy evaluation | We present a new gridded climate reconstruction for Europe for the last 12,000 years based on pollen data. The reconstruction is an update of Davis et al. (2003) using the same methodology, but with a greatly expanded fossil and surface-sample dataset and more rigorous quality-control. The modern pollen dataset has been increased by more than 80%, and the fossil pollen dataset by more than 50%, representing almost 60,000 individual pollen samples. The climate parameters reconstructed include summer/winter and annual temperatures and precipitation, as well as a measure of moisture balance, and growing degree-days above 5 degrees C. Confidence limits were established for the reconstruction based on transfer function and interpolation uncertainties. The reconstruction takes account of post-glacial isostatic readjustment which resulted in a potential warming bias of up to +1-2 degrees C for parts of Fennoscandia in the early Holocene, as well as changes in palaeogeography resulting from decaying ice sheets and rising post-glacial sea-levels. This new dataset has been evaluated against previously published independent quantitative climate reconstructions from a variety of archives on a site-by-site basis across Europe. The results of this comparison are generally very good; only chironomid-based reconstructions showed substantial differences with our values. Our reconstruction is available for download as gridded maps throughout the Holocene on a 1000-year time-step. The gridded format makes our reconstructions suitable for comparison with climate model output and for other applications such as vegetation and land-use modelling. Our new climate reconstruction suggests that warming in Europe during the mid-Holocene was greater in winter than in summer, an apparent paradox that is not consistent with current climate model simulations and traditional interpretations of Milankovitch theory.

24,"Holocene climate inferred from biological (Diptera : Chironomidae) analyses in a Southampton island (Nunavut, Canada) lake | Concerns about the effects of global warming on Arctic environments have stimulated multi-disciplinary research into the history of their long-term climatic and environmental variability to improve future predictions of climate in these remote areas. Here we present the first palaeolimnological study for Southampton Island using analyses of chironomids supported by sedimentological analyses, carried out on a 1 m long core retrieved from a lake located in the northeastern part of the island. This core was made up of marine sediments underneath 65 cm of freshwater lake sediments. A marine shell, humic-acids and chironomid head capsules were used to date this sequence. The Holocene environmental history of the lake consisted of two major contrasting periods. The first one, between about 5570 and 4360 cal. yr BP, was climatically unstable, with common postglacial chironomid taxa such as Corynocera oliveri-type, Paracladius and Microspectra radialis-type. This period also corresponded to the highest chironomid-inferred August air temperature (10 degrees C) for the whole record and to significant increases in major chemical elements as detected by x-ray fluorescence. During the second period, which lasted from about 3570 cal. yr BP until the present, limnological conditions seemed to stabilize after a change to cold oligotrophic chironomid taxa, such as Heterotrissocladius subpilosus-group, with no major variations in the abundance of chemical elements. Inferred August air temperatures ranged between 8 and 9 degrees C. This study provided unique information on the timing of the Holocene Thermal Maximum in the Foxe Basin area, a region with very little information available on long-term climate change. This region showed, so far, relatively few signs of recent climatic change, as opposed to other regions in the High Arctic. | ['francus', 'laperriere', 'larocque', 'pienitz', 'rolland'] | ","['francus', 'laperriere', 'larocque', 'pienitz', 'rolland']",1
25,"Holocene climate inferred from glacier extent, lake sediment and tree rings at Goat Lake, Kenai Mountains, Alaska, USA | Lake sediment, glacier extent and tree rings were used to reconstruct Holocene climate changes from Goat Lake at 550m asl in the Kenai Mountains, south-central Alaska. Radiocarbon-dated sediment cores taken at 55 m water depth show glacial-lacustrine conditions until about 9500 cal. yr BP, followed by organic-rich sedimentation with an overall increasing trend in organic matter and biogenic silica content leading Lip to the Little Ice Age (LIA). Through most of the Holocene, the northern Outlet of the Harding Icefield remained below the drainage divide that currently separates it from Goat Lake. A sharp transition from gyttja to inorganic mud about AD 1660 signifies the Journal of Quaternary Science reappearance of glacier meltwater into Goat Lake during the LIA, marking the maximum Holocene (postglacial) extent. Meltwater Continued to discharge into the lake until about AD 1900. A 207 yr tree-ring series from 25 Mountain hemlocks growing in the Goat Lake watershed correlates with other regional tree-ring series that indicate an average summer temperature reduction of about 1 degrees C during the 19th century compared with the early-mid 20th century. Cirque glaciers around Goat Lake reached their maximum LIA extent in the late 19th century. Assuming that glacier equilibrium-line altitudes (ELA) are controlled solely by summer temperature, then the cooling of 1 degrees C combined with the local environmental lapse rate would indicate an ELA lowering of 170 m. In contrast, reconstructed ELAs of 12 cirque glaciers near Goat Lake average only 34 +/- 18 m lower during the LIA. The restricted ELA lowering can be explained by a reduction in accumulation-season precipitation caused by a weakening of the Aleutian low-pressure system during the late LIA.

26,"Climate of the Little Ice Age and the past 2000 years in northeast Iceland inferred from chironomids and other lake sediment proxies | A sedimentary record from lake Stora ViA degrees arvatn in northeast Iceland records environmental changes over the past 2000 years. Downcore data include chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblage data and total organic carbon, nitrogen, and biogenic silica content. Sample scores from detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) of chironomid assemblage data are well correlated with measured temperatures at StykkishA(3)lmur over the 170 year instrumental record, indicating that chironomid assemblages at Stora ViA degrees arvatn have responded sensitively to past temperature changes. DCA scores appear to be useful for quantitatively inferring past temperatures at this site. In contrast, a quantitative chironomid-temperature transfer function developed for northwestern Iceland does a relatively poor job of reconstructing temperature shifts, possibly due to the lake's large size and depth relative to the calibration sites or to the limited resolution of the subfossil taxonomy. The pre-instrumental climate history inferred from chironomids and other paleolimnological proxies is supported by prior inferences from historical documents, glacier reconstructions, and paleoceanographic studies. Much of the first millennium AD was relatively warm, with temperatures comparable to warm decades of the twentieth century. Temperatures during parts of the tenth and eleventh centuries AD may have been comparably warm. Biogenic silica concentrations declined, carbon:nitrogen ratios increased, and some chironomid taxa disappeared from the lake between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries, recording the decline of temperatures into the Little Ice Age, increasing soil erosion, and declining lake productivity. All the proxy reconstructions indicate that the most severe Little Ice Age conditions occurred during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a period historically associated with maximum sea-ice and glacier extent around Iceland. | ['axford', 'geirsdottir', 'langdon', 'miller'] | ","['axford', 'geirsdottir', 'langdon', 'miller']",1
27,"Holocene climate reconstructions from the Fennoscandian tree-line area based on pollen data from Toskaljavri | Due to its location on the eastern North Atlantic seaboard, the Fennoscandian tree-line area is an ideal area to use biological proxies to assess the relative roles of the Scandinavian ice sheet and of oceanic, atmospheric, and astronomic forcings on regional climate history. Here we report pollen-based July mean temperature (Tjul) and annual precipitation (Pann) reconstructions from a sediment core from a high-altitude tree-line lake in northwestern Finland. The reconstructions suggest that at 9600-8300 cal yr B.P. Tjul values were low but steadily rising while Pann was high. The period of warmest summers, with Tjul values ca. 1.8degree-1.6degreeC higher than at present, occurred at ca. 8000-6500 cal yr B.P. Since then climate has become gradually cooler. Tjul values during the ""Medieval Warm Period"" (ca. 1400-1000 cal yr B.P.) were ca. 0.8degreeC higher that at present but decreased rapidly to the low ""Little Ice Age"" levels at 800 cal yr B.P. We compare these results with an earlier pollen-based climate reconstruction from the same region. The reconstructions indicate a similar general Holocene Tjul pattern with lower values in the reconstruction from the high-altitude lake. However, most of the small-scale variations are not synchronous, suggesting that they may represent noise rather than signal in our data. | ['birks', 'seppa'] | ","['birks', 'seppa']",4
28,"Climate response to the Samalas volcanic eruption in 1257 revealed by proxy records | The eruption of Samalas in Indonesia in 1257 ranks among the largest sulfur-rich eruptions of the Common Era with sulfur deposition in ice cores reaching twice the volume of the Tambora eruption in 1815. Sedimentological analyses of deposits confirm the exceptional size of the event, which had both an eruption magnitude and a volcanic explosivity index of 7. During the Samalas eruption, more than 40 km(3) of dense magma was expelled and the eruption column is estimated to have reached altitudes of 43 km. However, the climatic response to the Samalas event is debated since climate model simulations generally predict a stronger and more prolonged surface air cooling of Northern Hemisphere summers than inferred from tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions. Here, we draw on historical archives, ice-core data and tree-ring records to reconstruct the spatial and temporal climate response to the Samalas eruption. We find that 1258 and 1259 experienced some of the coldest Northern Hemisphere summers of the past millennium. However, cooling across the Northern Hemisphere was spatially heterogeneous. Western Europe, Siberia and Japan experienced strong cooling, coinciding with warmer-than-average conditions over Alaska and northern Canada. We suggest that in North America, volcanic radiative forcing was modulated by a positive phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Contemporary records attest to severe famines in England and Japan, but these began prior to the eruption. We conclude that the Samalas eruption aggravated existing crises, but did not trigger the famines. | ['beniston', 'churakova', 'corona', 'daux', 'davi', 'eckert', 'edouard', 'guillet', 'guiot', 'khodri', 'lavigne', 'luckman', 'masson', 'delmotte', 'myglan', 'oppenheimer', 'ortega', 'sielenou', 'stoffel', 'zhang'] | ","['beniston', 'churakova', 'corona', 'daux', 'davi', 'eckert', 'edouard', 'guillet', 'guiot', 'khodri', 'lavigne', 'luckman', 'masson', 'delmotte', 'myglan', 'oppenheimer', 'ortega', 'sielenou', 'stoffel', 'zhang']",4
29,"Holocene climate changes in southern Greenland: evidence from lake sediments | A Holocene lake sediment record is presented from Lake N14 situated on Angissoq island 15 km off the main coast of southern Greenland. The palaeoclimatic development has been interpreted on the basis of flux and percentage content of biogenic silica, clastic material, organic material and sulphur as well as sedimentation rate, moss content and magnetic susceptibility. A total of 43 radiocarbon dates has ensured a reliable chronology. It is argued that varying sediment composition mainly reflects changing precipitation. By analogy with the present meteorological conditions in southern Greenland, Holocene climate development is inferred. Between 11550 and 9300 cal. yr BP temperature and precipitation increase markedly, but this period is climatically unstable. From 9300 yr BP conditions become more stable and a Holocene climatic optimum, characterised by warm and humid conditions, is observed from 8000 to 5000 cal. yr BP. From 4700 cal. yr BP the first signs of a climatic deterioration are observed, and from 3700 cal. yr BP the climate has become more dry and cold. Superimposed on the climatic long-term trend is climate variability on a centennial time-scale that increases in amplitude after 3700 cal. yr BP. A climatic scenario related to the strength and position of the Greenland high-pressure cell and the Iceland low-pressure cell is proposed to explain the Holocene centennial climate variability. A comparison of the Lake N14 record with a terrestrial as well as a marine record from the eastern North Atlantic Ocean suggests that the centennial climate variability was uniform over large areas at certain times.

30,"Climate trends in northern Ontario and Quebec from borehole temperature profiles | The ground surface temperature histories of the past 500 years were reconstructed at 10 sites containing 18 boreholes in northeastern Canada. The boreholes, between 400 and 800m deep, are located north of 51 degrees N and west and east of James Bay in northern Ontario and Quebec. We find that both sides of James Bay have experienced similar ground surface temperature histories with a warming of 1.51 +/- 0.76K during the period of 1850 to 2000, similar to borehole reconstructions for the southern portion of the Superior Province and in agreement with available proxy data. A cooling period corresponding to the Little Ice Age was found at only one site. Despite permafrost maps locating the sites in a region of discontinuous permafrost, the ground surface temperature histories suggest that the potential for permafrost was minimal to absent over the past 500 years. This could be the result of air surface temperature interpolation used in permafrost models being unsuitable to account for the spatial variability of ground temperatures along with an offset between ground and air surface temperatures due to the snow cover. | ['beltrami', 'mareschal', 'pickler'] | ","['beltrami', 'mareschal', 'pickler']",1
31,"Holocene climate variability on the Kola Peninsula, Russian Subarctic, based on aquatic invertebrate records from lake sediments | Sedimentary records of invertebrate assemblages were obtained from a small lake in the Khibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula. Together with a quantitative chironomid-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature, these data provide evidence of Holocene climate variability in the western sector of the Russian Subarctic. The results suggest that the amplitude of climate change was more pronounced in the interior mountain area than near the White Sea coast. A chironomid-based temperature reconstruction reflects a warming trend in the early Holocene, interrupted by a transient cooling at ca. 8500-8000 cal yr BP with a maximum drop in temperature (ca. 1 degrees C) around 8200 cal yr BP. The regional Holocene Thermal Maximum, characterized by maximum warmth and dryness occurred at ca. 7900-5400 cal yr BP. During this period, July temperatures were at least 1 C higher than at present. The relatively warm and dry climate persisted until ca. 4000 cal yr BP, when a pronounced neoglacial cooling was initiated. Minimum temperatures, ca. 1-2 degrees C lower than at present, were inferred at ca. 3200-3000 cal yr BP. Faunal shifts in the stratigraphic profile imply also that the late-Holocene cooling was followed by a general increase in effective moisture. (C) 2013 University of Washington.

32,"Holocene Climate Variability in the Northern North Atlantic Region: A Review of Terrestrial and Marine Evidence | The Holocene epoch, which followed the last major pulse of glacialion (the Younger Dryas) at the end of the last glaciation, encompasses a period before there was any substantial anthropogenic forcing of climate. A synthesis of climatic development during the Holocene (ca. 11,500 cal. yr BP to the present) is based on pollen-based quantitative temperature reconstructions, tree-line variations, chironomids, tree-ring records, spelcothem data, glacier variations, and marine records (stable isotopes, species abundance, lithological changes) from the Nordic Seas. The Holocene has been regarded as a period of relatively stable climate, but recent evidence suggests there have been several significant millennial-scale cli- mate fluctuations (larger than the post mid-19th century warming trend) through- out the Holocene. A general climate warming in the first part of the Holocene was punctuated by a few, abrupt climate reversals, centred at 10,000, 9,700, and 8,200 cal. yr BP. The data suggest there was a period of relatively warm conditions in the first half of the Holocene, in many areas warmer than in the 20th century, after which temperatures generally declined. The temperature decline was punctuated by centennial-scale warmer and colder periods with the most recent cold episode (-AD 1550-1925), including the ""Little Ice Age"", being one of the coldest of the entire Holocene. The kind of data presented here can be used for detecting mech- anisms and forcing factors behind the reconstructed climate variations and to study leads and lags in the Earth's climate system. A comparison between the cli- mate-forcing factors and the Holocene records presented here suggests that the early Holocene thermal maximum observed in most records from the Nordic Seas region was caused by increased summer solar insolation to the northern Hemisphere. The suborbital millennial to decennial climate variability observed in the Holocene climate reconstructions was most probably a combined effect of solar activity changes, periods of increased explosive volcanism, and internal feedback mechanisms in the Earth's climate system. Internal modes of the climate system variability (for example, the North Atlantic Oscillation) were most likely responsible for some of the observed climate variability in winter. In addition to external climate-forcing factors, mcltwaler from the retreating northern hemi- sphere ice sheets and abrupt, catastrophic lake drainage from ice-marginal lakes during the termination of the last Ice Age had a significant, regional climate impact. In the near future, it will be possible to combine high-resolution palaco- climatic reconstructions with fully coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models in order to test the complex interactions between the different forcing factors to help explain the primary forcing factors and the accompanying feedbacks behind the observed Holocene climate development in the North Atlantic region. ¬© 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.

33,"Climate variability in the subarctic area for the last 2 millennia | To put recent climate change in perspective, it is necessary to extend the instrumental climate records with proxy data from paleoclimate archives. Arctic climate variability for the last 2 millennia has been investigated using statistical and signal analyses from three regionally averaged records from the North Atlantic, Siberia and Alaska based on many types of proxy data archived in the Arctic 2k database v1.1.1. In the North Atlantic and Alaska, the major climatic trend is characterized by long-term cooling interrupted by recent warming that started at the beginning of the 19th century. This cooling is visible in the Siberian region at two sites, warming at the others. The cooling of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was identified from the individual series, but it is characterized by wide-range spatial and temporal expression of climate variability, in contrary to the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The LIA started at the earliest by around AD 1200 and ended at the latest in the middle of the 20th century. The widespread temporal coverage of the LIA did not show regional consistency or particular spatial distribution and did not show a relationship with archive or proxy type either. A focus on the last 2 centuries shows a recent warming characterized by a well-marked warming trend parallel with increasing greenhouse gas emissions. It also shows a multidecadal variability likely due to natural processes acting on the internal climate system on a regional scale. A similar to 16-30-year cycle is found in Alaska and seems to be linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, whereas similar to 20-30- and similar to 50-90-year periodicities characterize the North Atlantic climate variability, likely in relation with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. These regional features are probably linked to the sea ice cover fluctuations through ice-temperature positive feedback. | ['colin', 'debret', 'devernal', 'divine', 'hormes', 'korhola', 'linderholm', 'massei', 'nicolle', 'werner'] | ","['colin', 'debret', 'devernal', 'divine', 'hormes', 'korhola', 'linderholm', 'massei', 'nicolle', 'werner']",2

Unfortunately, the analysis revealed that significant differences exist between vegetation records radiocarbon dated by decay counting and those dated by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), making the chronology of vegetation change difficult to interpret. Despite this, some general conclusions were reached: (1) At about 14,000 cal yr B.P., the initial peopling of Alaska occurred during a period of rapid climatic warming and increasing effective moisture. (2) The Younger Dryas (ca. 11,300-14,000 cal yr B.P.) had little effect on the vegetation and no effect on the people.

Thus, for example, years with unusually great tree‚Äêring growth in Siberian larch in the Polar Urals correlate with high frequency of occurrence of low‚Äêpressure systems over the Kara Sea which result in a warm, relatively dry air flow over the Polar Urals, resulting in heavy ablation on the IGAN Glacier; these conditions also correlate with an ‚Äúopen‚Äù; navigation season, in terms of sea ice, in the Kara Sea. By contrast years with limited tree growth correlate with a predominance of pressure systems giving rise to northerly winds, heavy cloud cover and heavy summer snowfall, resulting in reduced ablation on the glaciers of the Polar Urals; these conditions also correlate with more severe navigation conditions (due to ice) in the Kara Sea.

36,"Climatic and environmental changes in the Yana highlands of north-eastern Siberia over the last c. 57 000 years, derived from a sediment core from Lake Emanda | The sediment succession of Lake Emanda in the Yana Highlands was investigated to reconstruct the regional late Quaternary climate and environmental history. Hydro-acoustic data obtained during a field campaign in 2017 show laminated sediments in the north-western and deepest (up to ~15 m) part of the lake, where a ~6-m-long sediment core (Co1412) was retrieved. The sediment core was studied with a multi-proxy approach including sedimentological and geochemical analyses. The chronology of Co1412 is based on <sup>14</sup>C AMS dating on plant fragments from the upper 4.65 m and by extrapolation suggests a basal age of c. 57 cal. ka BP. Pronounced changes in the proxy data indicate that early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was characterized by unstable environmental conditions associated with short-term temperature and/or precipitation variations. This interval was followed by progressively colder and likely drier conditions during mid-MIS 3. A lake-level decline between 32.0 and 19.1 cal. ka BP was presumably related to increased continentality and dry conditions peaking during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A subsequent rise in lake level could accordingly have been the result of increased rainfall, probably in combination with seasonally high meltwater input. A milder or wetter Lateglacial climate increased lake productivity and vegetation growth, the latter stabilizing the catchment and reducing clastic input into the lake. The Bolling-Allerod warming, Younger Dryas cooling and Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) are indicated by distinct changes in the environment around Lake Emanda. Unstable, but similar-to-present-day climatic and environmental conditions have persisted since c. 5 cal. ka BP. The results emphasize the highly continental setting of the study site and therefore suggest that the climate at Lake Emanda was predominantly controlled by changes in summer insolation, global sea level, and the extent of ice sheets over Eurasia, which influenced atmospheric circulation pattern. | ['baumer', 'fedorov', 'leicher', 'lenz', 'melles', 'meyer', 'pestryakova', 'wagner'] | ","['baumer', 'fedorov', 'leicher', 'lenz', 'melles', 'meyer', 'pestryakova', 'wagner']",4
37,"Climatic influence on peatland formation and lateral expansion in sub-arctic Fennoscandia | The initiation and lateral expansion patterns of five small sub-arctic peatlands in the Fennoscandian tree-line region were studied by 21 accelerator mass spectrometry (AM S) C-14-dated basal-peat samples representing three to six dates per site. The radiocarbon dates were converted to calendar years and are based on the median probability. When combined with earlier basal-peat dates from the region, four distinctive periods can be observed in the cumulative record of the dates. The early Holocene, from c. 10 000 to 8000 cal. yr BP, was characterized by the fast initiation and rapid expansion of peatlands, whereas at 8000-4000 cal. yr BP lateral expansion was modest. The most intensive period of peatland expansion occurred at the beginning of the late Holocene at c. 4000 to 3000 cal. yr BP, after which it slowed down towards the present. All these periods are in rough agreement with the main Holocene climatic periods in the area, namely the relatively warm and moist early Holocene, the warm and dry Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) at 8000-4000 cal. yr BP, and the start of the cooler and moister trend (neoglacial cooling) from c. 4000 cal. yr BP to the present, indicating a broad-scale climatic control on the lateral growth of sub-arctic peatlands in Fennoscandia. In order to study the lateral expansion of peatlands and to evaluate their Holocene succession patterns, more studies based on multiple dates from the same peatland are needed. | ['korhola', 'seppa', 'weckstrom'] | ","['korhola', 'seppa', 'weckstrom']",1
38,"Climatic changes in Northern Europe since late glacial times, with special reference to dendroclimatological studies in northern Finnish Lapland | The oxygen isotope variations in deep Greenland ice cores indicate large and extremely rapid temperature oscillations during the last ice age. Strongly fluctuating climatic conditions also characterized the final few thousand years of the Weichselian glaciation. Temperatures rose to levels near their present values during the B√∂lling-Aller√∂d interstadial, but during the Younger Dryas episode (12,700 -11,500 years ago) the cold ice age conditions came back. The cold spell ended with an abrupt warming about 11,500 years ago and it marked the beginning of the present warm interglacial, the Holocene. The Holocene climate has also varied, but all oscillations in temperatures have been an order of magnitude smaller than those common in the North Atlantic region during the last ice age. Temperatures rose to about present-day values in early Holocene time and generally continued to rise slowly until 6000 - 5000 BP. During the last 5000 years climatic conditions have gradually become cooler and obviously somewhat more unstable. The variations in humidity show some differences in various regions of Fennoscandia, but since 2500 BP, wetness has generally increased. There are different climatic proxy data which can be used for Holocene studies, but the extraction and interpretation of signals of small short-term changes is often difficult because of unavoidable inaccuracies in data and dating. The main trends of Holocene climatic development are relatively well known over northern Europe, but the short-term variations are not known in detail. Tree rings provide a possibility to study high-frequency climatic variability, since annual and even seasonal resolution in dating can be achieved using dendrochronology. The pine tree-ring data collected from the tree-line area of northern Fennoscandia indicate changes in past summer temperatures. The absolute tree-ring curve constructed from subfossil pines (Pinus sylvestris, L.) of Finnish Lapland indicates a duration of over 2000 years, extending to 165 B.C. and, after a ca. 200-year gap, the older unbroken part of the chronology extends until about 7500 calendar years before present. Preliminary interpretations of the data suggest that the climatic variability in the study area increased around 5000 BP with a subsequent trend towards cooler and wetter climatic conditions. | ['eronen', 'zetterberg'] | ","['eronen', 'zetterberg']",4
39,"A 2000 year record of climatic change at Ongoke Lake, southwest Alaska | We analyzed sediments of the past 2000 years from Ongoke Lake, southwest Alaska, for organic carbon, organic nitrogen, biogenic silica (BSi), and diatom assemblages at decadal to centennial resolution to infer limnological changes that may be related to climatic variation in southwestern Alaska. The chronology is based on a Pb-210 profile from bulk sediments and nine AMS C-14 ages from terrestrial plant macrofossils. Four of the C-14 ages span a core depth interval of 60.5 cm but are statistically indistinguishable from one another with a mean of similar to 1300 AD, which compromises the determination of temporal trends at Ongoke Lake and comparison with other paleoclimate records. The diatom record suggests changes in the duration of ice cover and strength of thermal stratification that are probably related to temperature variation. This variation includes a cold interval around the first millennium cooling (FMC) and a warm interval spanning the medieval climate anomaly (MCA). However, the lake-sediment record shows no clear signals of temperature variation for the period of the Little Ice Age (LIA) or the twentieth century. Climatic changes during these periods may have been manifested through effective-moisture (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) variation in the Ongoke Lake area. We estimate water depths and infer effective-moisture fluctuations by applying a regional transfer function to our diatom record. Together with inferences from diatom autecologies, this water-depth reconstruction suggests that effective moisture increased steadily from 50 BC to 350 AD, which was followed by relatively dry conditions between 550 and 750 AD and relatively wet conditions between 750 and 1450 AD. Effective moisture was low from similar to 1450 to 1850 AD, coinciding with the LIA; an alternative age model places this interval between similar to 1315 and 1850 AD. During the past 150 years, effective moisture increased, with estimated water depths reaching peak values in the second half of the twentieth century. This study offers the first paleolimnological record for inferring centennial-scale climatic variation over the past two millennia from southwestern Alaska. | ['chipman', 'clarke', 'clegg', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'hu'] | ","['chipman', 'clarke', 'clegg', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'hu']",1
40,"Holocene climatic change reconstructed from diatoms, chironomids, pollen and near-infrared spectroscopy at an alpine lake (Sjuodjljaure) in northern Sweden | The results of a multiproxy study reconstructing the climate history of the last 9300 years in northern Sweden are presented. It is based on diatom, chironomid and pollen analyses, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), of a radiocarbon dated sediment core from Sjuodjijaure (67 degrees 22'N, 18 degrees 04'E), situated 100 m above tree-line in the Scandes mountains. Mean July air temperature was reconstructed using transfer functions established for the region. The biological proxies show significant changes in composition during the Holocene and the inferred temperatures all follow the same general trend. For the period between about 9300 to 7300 cal. BP the reconstructions should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of convincing modem analogues in the training set. However the reconstruction suggest that July temperature was on average about the same as today, with several rapid short-term cold and warm periods. Cold periods were dated to about 8500, 8200 and 7600 cal. years BP and a warm period to about 7700 cal. BP. About 7300 cal. BP, a major shift to a warmer climate occurred. Pine migrated into the area, which was previously covered with birch forest. From the mid-Holocene until today the sediment record suggests a descending tree-limit and a gradual lowering of July temperature. | ['birks', 'eriksson', 'renberg', 'rosen', 'segerstrom'] | ","['birks', 'eriksson', 'renberg', 'rosen', 'segerstrom']",2
41,"Holocene climatic change in Swedish Lapland inferred from an oxygen-isotope record of lacustrine biogenic silica | Holocene climatic variability was studied in a 9500-year lake-sediment sequence from the Abisko region in Swedish Lapland, using the oxygen-isotope ratio in diatom biogenic silica (delta O-18(si)). Oxygen- and hydrogen-isotope ratios of waters from the Abisko area suggest that in this region the evaporative flux is small and the isotopic composition of most lakes reflects that of the local precipitation. The hydrological setting of the region and sensitivity analysis of isotopic response to changing climatic parameters such as humidity, inflow and evaporation show that the downcore diatom delta O-18(si) record is primarily controlled by changes in the summer isotopic composition of the lake water. The overall 3.5 parts per thousand depletion in delta O-18(si) since the early Holocene is interpreted as an increase in the influence of the Arctic polar continental air mass that carries depleted precipitation. We estimate that this change is associated with a 2.5-4 degreesC cooling that has occurred since the early Holocene. In general, the diatom delta O-18(si) record resembles the average annual air temperature reconstructed for the Greenland ice core GISP2, especially during the past 4000 years, with a pronounced cooling starting at 2000 years BP. | ['bigler', 'karlen', 'rietti', 'shati', 'rosqvist', 'rubensdotter', 'shemesh', 'yam'] | ","['bigler', 'karlen', 'rietti', 'shati', 'rosqvist', 'rubensdotter', 'shemesh', 'yam']",1

43,"Climatic variability during the last millennium in Western Iceland from lake sediment records | The aim of this research was to create a decadal-scale terrestrial quantitative palaeoclimate record for NW Iceland from lake sediments for the last millennium. Geochemical, stable isotope and chironomid reconstructions were obtained from a lake sequence constrained by tephra deposits on the Snaefellsnes peninsula, western Iceland. Obtaining a quantitative record proved problematic, but the qualitative chironomid record showed clear trends associated with past summer temperatures, and the sedimentological records provided evidence for past changes in precipitation, mediated through catchment soil in-wash. When the full range of chronological uncertainty is considered, four clear phases of climatic conditions were identified: (1) a relatively warm phase between AD 1020 and 1310; (2) a relatively stable period between AD 1310 and 1510, cooler than the preceding period but still notably warmer than the second half of the millennium; (3) a consistent reduction of temperatures between AD 1560 and 1810, with the coolest period between AD 1680 and 1810; and (4) AD 1840-2000 has temperatures mainly warmer than in the preceding two centuries, with a rising trend and increased variability from c. AD 1900 onwards. The reconstructions show clearly that the first half of the millennium experienced warmer climatic conditions than the second half, with a return to the warmer climate only occurring in the last c. 100 years. Much of the variability of the chironomid record can be linked to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The reconstructions presented can track low-frequency and long-term trends effectively and consistently but high-resolution and calibrated quantitative records remain more of a challenge - not just in finding optimal sedimentary deposits but also in finding the most reliable proxy. It is this that presents the real challenge for Holocene climate reconstruction from this key area of the North Atlantic. | ['caseldine', 'croudace', 'davy', 'holmes', 'langdon', 'leng', 'wastegard'] | ","['caseldine', 'croudace', 'davy', 'holmes', 'langdon', 'leng', 'wastegard']",1
44,"From cold to cool in northernmost Norway: Lateglacial and early Holocene multi-proxy environmental and climate reconstructions from Jansvatnet, Hammerfest | A multi-proxy palaeoecological study of the lateglacial and early Holocene sediments of Jansvatnet, Hammerfest, northernmost Norway (70 degrees 39' N) showed that cold and arid conditions prevailed in both the lateglacial interstadial and the Younger Dryas. Terrestrial proxies are macrofossils and pollen. Aquatic proxies are plant and invertebrate macrofossils, pollen, diatoms, and chironomids. Mean July temperatures were reconstructed using pollen and chironomid calibration functions and ecological knowledge of the fossil flora and fauna. Lake-water pH was reconstructed using a diatom pH-calibration function. Above sterile basal deglacial silts, biotic activity was detected around 14600 years ago in the interstadial (chronologically equivalent to the Bolling-Allerod in the Greenland Ice-Core Chronology). Catchment vegetation resembled polar desert and ultra-cold stenothermic chironomids lived in the lake. However, diatom assemblages were diverse and dynamic. In the Younger Dryas stadial, conditions deteriorated. In the early Younger Dryas chironomid-inferred air temperatures (CI-Tjul) fell about 1 C. Pollen-inferred temperatures (PI-Tjul) did not fall and the terrestrial vegetation hardly changed because of the extreme aridity. The lake water was turbid from suspended clay which diminished aquatic life. Later in the Younger Dryas (ca 12400 cal yr BP) reconstructed mean July temperatures fell by a further 3 degrees C and were close to the minimum to support life, at around 3-4 degrees C. However, decreased turbidity allowed moss growth on the lake bottom that provided habitats for invertebrates and diatoms. In the last 200 years of the Younger Dryas temperatures increased by 2-3 degrees C and terrestrial and aquatic organisms responded quickly. At the start of the Holocene a rapid increase of more than 3 C in PI-Tjul to 9.5 degrees C initiated the replacement of sparse arctic tundra by low-arctic dwarf-shrub heath. Simultaneously, a further 2 degrees C increase in CI-Tjul to 10-11 degrees C reflected a regime shift in the lake. Aquatic macrophytes rapidly replaced the moss carpet, diatom assemblages stabilised and diatom plankton developed, and cold stenotherm chironomids were replaced by cool-temperate taxa. Productivity increased as CI-Tjul reached a steady maximum of around 12 degrees C and PI-Tjul reached 10.5 degrees C at about 10000 cal yr BR At this time, tree-birch arrived and woodland developed over the catchment. Birch could have immigrated from the south up the west coast or from the east along the Barents Sea coast. Acidophilous aquatic taxa increased as diatom-inferred pH gradually decreased from 7.3 to 6.6. After ca 9380 cal yr BP, the density and extent of birch woodland decreased and species of exposed rocky areas increased, reflecting increased windiness, precipitation, and possibly a small decrease in July temperatures. Birch now formed the arctic tree-line at Jansvatnet. The lateglacial climatic pattern at Jansvatnet resembles patterns detected elsewhere in northern Norway and Svalbard and in marine records from the Norwegian and Barents Seas but contrasts with patterns in southern Norway.

45,"Cold period in the Northern Europe in the past (about 8200 years ago): analysis of empirical data and possible causes | Cold episode in Northern Europe happened about 8200 years ago was known for a relatively long time, mainly due to paleobotanical (palynological) data obtained from analysis of lake and peat sediments. Detailed analysis of ice cores from the Greenland holes GRIP, GISP2, and NGRIP with a time resolution of about 10 years made possible to refine the duration and characteristics of the time structure of this cold period. This cooling lasted for approximately 160 yr. Spore-pollen analysis of lake sediments in Northern Europe (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, the North and North-West of Russia) and deep-sea cores of the North Atlantic showed that the mean annual air temperature during the maximum stage of the cooling was reduced by 1-2 degrees C, and in some areas by more than 3 degrees C. The cold spread from the coast of the North Atlantic into the European continent and manifested itself mostly in Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, and to a lesser extent in the North-West and West of the Russian Federation. In the central Russia and North of 70 degrees N the cooling was weak or absent. The question about a nature of this cold event and other cold spells in Late Glaciation, known as the cold of the early, middle and late Dryas, is widely discussed in the scientific literature. Most of scientists accept a hypothesis proposed more than 20 years ago, that the reduction of air temperatures in regions immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic was caused by the large volume of melt water discharged into the ocean as a result of disintegration and melting of ice-sheets. Climate models that take into account these effects allow estimating a decrease in the air and sea surface temperature due to freshening (desalination) of the upper ocean layer, and this confirms that the greatest decrease in temperature should be observed in the regions directly adjacent to the ocean. The increase in global temperature over the last 30 years is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C, which is already reflected in a noticeable increase in precipitation in high latitudes. In addition, the melting of mountain glaciers and sea ice in the Arctic basin promotes freshening of the upper ocean, and as a result of these processes one can expect a certain decrease in the air temperature in the high latitudes if the present-day climate warming will continue. On the basis of paleoclimatic data, it can be assumed that such a decrease in air temperature can be relatively small and occur only in areas directly adjacent to the North Atlantic. | ['borisova', 'borzenkova', 'ii', 'sapelko', 'zhiltsova'] | ","['borisova', 'borzenkova', 'ii', 'sapelko', 'zhiltsova']",1
46,"A combined oxygen and silicon diatom isotope record of Late Quaternary change in Lake El'gygytgyn, North East Siberia | Determining the response of sites within the Arctic Circle to long-term climatic change remains an essential pre-requisite for assessing the susceptibility of these regions to future global warming and Arctic amplification. To date, existing records from North East Russia have demonstrated significant spatial variability across the region during the late Quaternary. Here we present diatom delta O-18 and delta Si-30 data from Lake El'gygytgyn, Russia, and suggest environmental changes that would have impacted across West Beringia from the Last Glacial Maximum to the modern day. In combination with other records, the results raise the potential for climatic teleconnections to exist between the region and sites in the North Atlantic. The presence of a series of 2-3 parts per thousand decreases in delta O-18(diatom) during both the Last Glacial and the Holocene indicates the sensitivity of the region to perturbations in the global climate system. Evidence of an unusually long Holocene thermal maximum from 11.4 ka BP to 7.6 ka BP is followed by a cooling trend through the remainder of the Holocene in response to changes in solar insolation. This is culminated over the last 900 years by a significant decrease in delta O-18(diatom) of 2.3 parts per thousand, which may be related to a strengthening and easterly shift of the Aleutian Low in addition to possible changes in precipitation seasonality.

47,"A Comparison of Evidence for Late Holocene Summer Temperature Variations in the Northern Hemisphere | Data on glacier, tree-line, tree-ring, pollen, and ice-core variations in North America, Greenland, and Europe during the last 2000 yr (up to A.D. 1800) are compared in detail on the century time scale. Only data that may be indicative of summer temperature changes are included, since these comprise most of the available paleoclimatic information, although some variations (especially of glaciers) may have been in response to precipitation changes instead. Radiocarbon dates and 14C-dated records are converted to calendar (dendrochronological) years using the calibration of M. Stuiver (1982). Despite the basic uncertainties in dating, interpretation, response times, and noise level of proxy climatic data, there is at times good agreement among different kinds of evidence from within a region to suggest an episode of generally warmer or cooler summers. Three previously identified episodes find expression in records from all of the regions considered: the Little Ice Age of the last few centuries, a Medieval Warm Period around the 12th century A.D., and an earlier cold period some time between the 8th and 10th centuries. The timing of minima and maxima within these episodes seems to have varied from region to region (although the evidence is consistent within regions). In the 15th century, summers were warm in the eastern Canadian Arctic and southern Greenland while there was a cold episode in Europe and western North America. | ['wigley', 'williams'] | ","['wigley', 'williams']",1
48,"A comparison of modern and preindustrial levels of mercury in the teeth of beluga in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, and walrus at Igloolik, Nunavut, Canada | Mercury (Hg) concentrations were compared in modern and preindustrial teeth of belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) at sites in the Canadian Arctic so that the relative amounts of natural and anthropogenic Hg in modern animals could be estimated. Mercury levels in the teeth of Beaufort Sea belugas captured in the Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, in 1993 were significantly (p=0.0001) higher than those in archeological samples dated A.D. 1450-1650. In terms of geometric means, the Hg levels in modern animals were approximately four times as high as preindustrial levels in 10-year-old belugas, rising with age to 17 times as high in 30-year-olds. Because Hg levels in modern teeth were highly correlated with those in soft tissues, including muscle and muktuk, which are part of traditional human diets, it is likely that soft-tissue Hg has increased to a similar degree over the past few centuries. The increase was not due to dietary differences over time, as shown by analysis of stable-C and -N isotopes in the teeth, and was unlikely to be due to sex differences or to chemical diagenesis of historical samples. Industrially related Hg inputs to the Arctic Ocean and Canadian Arctic Archipelago may be the most likely explanation for the increase. If so, then 80-95% of the total Hg in modern Beaufort Sea belugas more than 10 years old may be attributed to anthropogenic activities. In contrast, tooth Hg concentrations in walrus at Igloolik, Nunavut, were no higher in the 1980s and 1990s than in the period A.D. 1200-1500, indicating an absence of industrial Hg in the species at this location. | ['dyke', 'hobson', 'mcneely', 'outridge'] | ","['dyke', 'hobson', 'mcneely', 'outridge']",4
49,"A comparison between multiproxy and historical data (AD 1990-1840) of drift ice conditions on the East Greenland Shelf (similar to 66 degrees N) | The reduction in sea ice along the SE Greenland coast during the last century has severely impacted ice-rafting to this area. In order to reconstruct ice-rafting and oceanographic conditions in the area of Denmark Strait during the last similar to 150 years, we conducted a multiproxy study on three short (20 cm) sediment cores from outer Kangerdlugssuaq Trough (similar to 300 m water depth). The proxy-based data obtained have been compared with historical and instrumental data to gain a better understanding of the ice sheet-ocean interactions in the area. A robust chronology has been developed based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 measurements on core PO175GKC#9 (similar to 66.2 degrees N, 32 degrees W) and expanded to the two adjacent cores based on correlations between calcite weight percent records. Our proxy records include sea-ice and phytoplankton biomarkers, and a variety of mineralogical determinations based on the <2 mm sediment fraction, including identification with quantitative x-ray diffraction, ice-rafted debris counts on the 63-150 mu m sand fraction, and source identifications based on the composition of Fe oxides in the 45-250 mu m fraction. A multivariate statistical analysis indicated significant correlations between our proxy records and historical data, especially with the mean annual temperature data from Stykkisholmur (Iceland) and the storis index (historical observations of sea-ice export via the East Greenland Current). In particular, the biological proxies (calcite weight percent, IP25, and total organic carbon %) showed significant linkage with the storis index. Our records show two distinct intervals in the recent history of the SE Greenland coast. The first of these (ad 1850-1910) shows predominantly perennial sea-ice conditions in the area, while the second (ad 1910-1990) shows more seasonally open water conditions. | ['alonso', 'garcia', 'andrew', 'belt', 'cabedo', 'sanz', 'darby', 'jaeger'] | ","['alonso', 'garcia', 'andrew', 'belt', 'cabedo', 'sanz', 'darby', 'jaeger']",1
50,"Complex responses of phototrophic communities to climate warming during the Holocene of northeastern Ontario, Canada | Historical changes in Holocene climate in northeastern Ontario were quantified using analyses of sedimentary pollen, diatoms, and pigments in a small boreal lake. Modern analog reconstructions of average temperature from Holocene pollen assemblages of Charland Lake showed temperature was similar to 2 degrees C warmer than present conditions similar to 7800-4500 cal. yr BP, a time period consistent with the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). Pollen data suggest a two-phase HTM: warm and dry conditions based on the presence of primarily Pinus spp., followed by warm and wet conditions based on increases in cedar. Overall, algal production was low during the HTM, as reflected by low concentrations of pigments and diatoms. In the late HTM, increases in cedar pollen and planktonic diatoms suggest sustained increases in water levels for the remainder of the Holocene. During the Post-HTM Period (similar to 4500-2000 cal. yr BP), a period that was warmer than today but cooler than the HTM, overall pigment production was significantly higher than all other periods. However, changes in diatom species composition suggest this period was not uniform, with variation occurring between diatoms indicative of higher and lower nutrient levels. The last similar to 2000 cal. yr BP was less productive than the Post-HTM Period but more productive than the HTM with higher production from diatoms and cyanobacteria. This study suggests that the relationship between climate and lake water production can be quite complex, and that changes in temperature, precipitation, light, lake levels, and mixing patterns are among factors that are related to changes in subfossil phototroph assemblages. | ['boreux', 'cumming', 'elmslie', 'gushulak', 'lamoureux', 'leavitt'] | ","['boreux', 'cumming', 'elmslie', 'gushulak', 'lamoureux', 'leavitt']",1

The climate evolution since 11,600 yr B.P. is basically described by using temperature estimations from Greenland ice cores and vegetation changes (pollen assemblage zones) oscillating around an average temperature with an interval of around +/-1-3degreesC. These main climatic oscillations can be refined by using multi-proxy data on an annual-decadal resolution revealing trends, fluctuations and short events, giving hints to possible pace makers. However, we have to keep in mind that these climatic descriptions axe generalizations due to the sensitivities of the used proxy and may reflect only a local instead of a regional or global signal. Therefore, an integration of many proxy-records is necessary to reconstruct the dominating climate regime. | ['negendank'] | ",['negendank'],4
52,"Constraining recent Shiveluch volcano eruptions (Kamchatka, Russia) by means of dendrochronology | Shiveluch (N 56 degrees 38', E 161 degrees 19'; elevation: active dome similar to 2500 m, summit of Old Shiveluch 3283 m) is one of the most active volcanoes in Kamchatka. The eruptions of Shiveluch commonly result in major environmental damage caused by debris avalanches, hot pyroclastic flows, tephra falls and lahars. Constraining these events in time and space is important for the understanding and prediction of these natural hazards. The last major eruption of Shiveluch occurred in 2005; earlier ones, dated by instrumental, historical, (14)C and tephrochronological methods, occurred in the last millennium around AD 1030, 1430, 1650, 1739, 1790-1810, 1854, 1879-1883, 1897-1898, 1905, 1927-1929, 1944-1950, and 1964. A lava dome has been growing in the 1964 crater since 1980, occasionally producing tephra falls and pyroclastic flows. Several Shiveluch eruptions (similar to AD 1050, 1650, 1854, 1964) may have been climatically effective and are probably recorded in the Greenland ice cores. Previously, most dates for eruptions before AD 1854 were obtained by tephrochronology and constrained by radiocarbon dating with an accuracy of several decades or centuries. In this paper we report tree-ring dates for a recent pyroclastic flow in Baidarnaia valley. Though the wood buried in these deposits is carbonized, fragile and poorly preserved, we were able to measure ring-width using standard tree-ring equipment or photographs and to cross-date these samples against the regional Kamchatka larch ring-width chronology. The dates of the outer rings indicate the date of the eruptions. In the Baidarnaia valley the eruption occurred shortly after AD 1756, but not later than AD 1758. This date coincides with the decrease of ring-width in trees growing near Shiveluch volcano in 1758-1763 in comparison with the control 'non-volcanic' chronology. The pyroclastic flow in Kamenskaia valley, although similar in appearance to the one in Baidarnaia valley, definitively yielded a different age. Due to the age limit of the reference chronology (AD 1632-2005) and its short overlap with the sample chronology in Kamenskaia valley the dates of these deposits are very preliminary. The deposits probably date back to approximately AD 1649 or a few years later. This date is in close agreement with the previously obtained radiocarbon date of these sediments to AD 1641(1652)1663. Our data agree well with the tephrochronological findings, and further constrain the chronology of volcanic events in this remote area. | ['curtis', 'jacoby', 'pavlova', 'pevzner', 'ponomareva', 'solomina'] | ","['curtis', 'jacoby', 'pavlova', 'pevzner', 'ponomareva', 'solomina']",2
53,"A continuous record of Holocene eolian activity in West Greenland | Aeolian landforms are widespread alongside proglacial valley-sandurs in West Greenland and comprise low-relief sand sheets, climbing dunes, and upland loess. Sedimentary facies mainly reflect distance to outwash-source zones and the influence of vegetation cover. The sediments show stratification types typical for poorly to moderately vegetated sand-sheets, alternately laminated silt/peat sequences, and unstratified loess. Twenty-five accelerator mass spectrometry <sup>14</sup>C dates provide the basis for the chronostratigraphy of the inland aeolian deposits. <sup>14</sup>C dates from interstratified sand-sheets suggest that the bulk of aeolian sands were deposited prior to 3400 cal yr B.P. and after 550 cal yr B.P. This two-phase formation for the inland dunes most likely reflects local changes in proglacial floodplain development and meltwater rerouting associated with a significant recession of the Greenland ice sheet during the mid Holocene climate optimum. Subsequent floodplain regeneration and renewed sand-sheet formation after 550 cal yr B.P. followed when the ice margin readvanced to its present position. In contrast, atmospheric deposition of regionally derived silt in upland peat mires has been continuous since at least 4750 cal yr B.P. Silt influx data demonstrate a strongly episodic history of the intensity of aeolian activity over the past five millennia, which tentatively reflects alternating periods of (winter) aridity associated with the variable incursion of maritime air masses over the interior ice-free areas of West Greenland. | ['hoogakker', 'koster', 'tatenhove', 'willemse'] | ","['hoogakker', 'koster', 'tatenhove', 'willemse']",1
54,"Decadal-scale sea ice changes in the Canadian Arctic and their impacts on humans during the past 4,000 years | Climate warming of >1.5 degrees C over three decades has diminished Arctic sea ice and forced drastic changes on Inuit people of the Canadian Arctic. Discontinuities in archaeological records also suggest that climatic changes may have caused site abandonment and life style shifts in Paleo- and Neo-eskimo societies. We therefore examine the decadal-scale palaeoclimatic changes recorded by quantitative palynological data in marine records from Coburg Polynya, near Palaeo- and Neo-eskimo settlements on the North Devon Lowlands, and from the North Water Polynya between Canada and Northwest Greenland. Palaeotransfer functions from dinoflagellate cyst assemblages provide quantitative estimates of changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice cover (SIC) with the accuracy of historical measurements. Both sites record temperature variations of 2-4 degrees C corresponding to changes in hunting modes and occupation-abandonment cycles on Devon and Ellesmere Islands. Our data show that from similar to 6500 to 2600 BP, there were large oscillations in summer SST from 2-4 degrees C cooler than present to 6 degrees C warmer and SIC ranged from 2 months more sea ice to 4 months more open water. The warmer interval corresponds to the period of pre-Dorset cultures that hunted muskox and caribou. Subsequent marine-based Dorset and Neo-eskimo cultures correspond to progressively cooler intervals with expanded sea ice cover. The warming took similar to 50-100 years and lasted similar to 300 years before replacement by colder intervals lasting similar to 200-500 years. These climate oscillations are more rapid than the archaeological cultural changes, but are of similar length to successive Palaeoeskimo occupations in the Nares Strait region. | ['levac', 'mudie', 'rochon'] | ","['levac', 'mudie', 'rochon']",4

56,"A deglacial and Holocene record of climate variability in south-central Alaska from stable oxygen isotopes and plant macrofossils in peat | We used stable oxygen isotopes derived from bulk-peat (delta O-18(TOM)), in conjunction with plant macrofossils and previously published carbon accumulation records, in a 14,500 cal yr BP peat core (HT Fen) from the Kenai lowlands in south-central Alaska to reconstruct the climate history of the area. We find that patterns are broadly consistent with those from lacustrine records across the region, and agree with the interpretation that major shifts in delta O-18(TOM) values indicate changes in strength and position of the Aleutian Low (AL), a semi-permanent low-pressure cell that delivers winter moisture to the region. We find decreased strength or a more westerly position of the AL (relatively higher delta O-18(TOM) values) during the Bolling-Allerod, Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), and late Holocene, which also correspond to warmer climate regimes. These intervals coincide with greater peat preservation and enhanced carbon (C) accumulation rates at the HT Fen and with peatland expansion across Alaska. The HTM in particular may have experienced greater summer precipitation as a result of an enhanced Pacific subtropical high, a pattern consistent with modern delta O-18 values for summer precipitation. The combined warm summer temperatures and greater summer precipitation helped promote the observed rapid peat accumulation. A strengthened AL (relatively lower delta O-18(TOM) values) is most evident during the Younger Dryas, Neoglaciation, and the Little Ice Age, consistent with lower peat preservation and C accumulation at the HT Fen, suggesting less precipitation reaches the leeward side of the Kenai Mountains during periods of enhanced AL strength. The peatlands on the Kenai Peninsula thrive when the AL is weak and the contribution of summer precipitation is higher, highlighting the importance of precipitation seasonality in promoting peat accumulation. This study demonstrates that delta O-18(TOM) values in peat can be applied toward understand large-scale shifts in atmospheric circulation over millennial timescales.

The focus of this study is two cores from Herald Canyon, piston core SWERUS-L2-4-PC1 (4-PC1) and multicore SWERUS-L2-4-MC1 (4-MC1), and a gravity core from an East Siberian Sea transect, SWERUS-L2-20-GC1 (20GC1).

Using calibrated radiocarbon ages mainly on molluscs for chronology and the ecology of benthic foraminifera and ostracode species to estimate paleodepths, the data reveal a dominance of river-proximal species during the early part of the Younger Dryas event (YD, Greenland Stadial GS-1) followed by a rise in river-intermediate species in the late Younger Dryas or the early Holocene (Preboreal) period. A rapid relative sea level rise beginning at roughly 11.4 to 10.8 ka (similar to 400 cm of core depth) is indicated by a sharp faunal change and unconformity or condensed zone of sedimentation. Regional sea level at this time was about 108m b.s.l. at the 4-PC1 site and 102m b.s.l. at 20-GC1. Regional sea level near the end of the YD was up to 42-47m lower than predicted by geophysical models corrected for glacio-isostatic adjustment. This discrepancy could be explained by delayed isostatic adjustment caused by a greater volume and/or geo-graphical extent of glacial-age land ice and/or ice shelves in the western Arctic Ocean and adjacent Siberian land areas. | ['cronin', 'gemery', 'jakobsson', 'oregan', 'pearce', 'semiletov', 'toomey'] | ","['cronin', 'gemery', 'jakobsson', 'oregan', 'pearce', 'semiletov', 'toomey']",2
58,"Deglaciation chronology, sea-level changes and environmental changes from Holocene lake sediments of Germania Havn So, Sabine O, northeast Greenland | Germania Havn So is located at the outermost coast of northeastern Greenland. According to radiocarbon dating, the lake basin was deglaciated in the early Holocene, around 11,000 cal yr BP. At that time the lake was a marine bay, but the lake was isolated soon after deglaciation at similar to 10,600 cal yr BP. The marine fauna was species-poor, indicating harsh conditions with a high sedimentation rate and lowered salinity due to glacial meltwater supply. The pioneer,vegetation around the lake was dominated by mosses and herbs. Deposition of relatively coarse sediments during the early Holocene indicates erosion of the newly deglaciated terrain. Remains of the first woody plant (Salix herbacea) appear at 7600 cal yr BP and remains of other woody plants (Salix arctica, Dryas octopetala, Cassiope tetragona and Empetrum nigrum) appear around one millennium later. Declining concentrations of D. octopetala and the caddis fly Apatania zonella in the late Holocene probably imply falling summer temperatures. Only moderate changes in the granulometric and geochemical record during the Holocene indicate relatively stable environmental settings in the lake, which can probably be explained by its location at the outer coast and the buffering effect of the neighboring ocean.

59,"Deglaciation and Shoreline Displacement on Alexandra Land, Franz Josef Land | C-14 datings of driftwood from raised beaches on the island Alexandra Land, Franz Josef Land, Russia, indicate deglaciation by 6800 C-14 years BP. The age of a diamicton containing small shell fragments, found beneath a beach ridge formed c. 5000 BP, has been dated to 8265 +/- 90 C-14 years BP (age after sea correction 7755 BP), suggesting that Alexandra Land was at least partly deglaciated by that time. The deposit containing shell fragments has been interpreted as a till which, if the interpretation is correct, indicates that a glacial advance occurred sometime between 7800 and 6800 BP. The highest shoreline, 23.5 m a.s.l., was formed either during a rapid deglaciation of the island or during a transgression. A shoreline displacement curve has been constructed for Alexandra Land. The rate of shore displacement since 6800 BP is calculated to 0.3 m/100 years. No pumice was found on Alexandra Land. Lunar Ice Cap on Alexandra Land was smaller than it is at present when the highest shoreline was formed, 6800 BP. The ice cap is believed to now be close to its Mid- to Late Holocene maximum, as almost all fluctuations of the Lunar Ice Cap since the deglaciation seem to have been within the present day glacier margin. A climatic deterioration c. 2000 BP is indicated by the formation of an ice/snow dammed lake. Evidence of former glacier movement directions, such as striae and chattermarks, were not found on Alexandra Land. However, the large scale bedrock topography and the orientation of elongated bedrock basins seem to indicate ice flow in a southeast to northwest direction. | ['glazovskiy', 'naslund', 'zale'] | ","['glazovskiy', 'naslund', 'zale']",1
60,"Diatom evidence of hydrographic changes and ice conditions in Igaliku Fjord, South Greenland, during the past 1500 years | Biostratigraphic diatom analyses were carried out on two sediment cores from Igaliku Fjord, South Greenland, in order to reconstruct hydrographic and climatic fluctuations during the late Holocene (AD 550 to present). Pronounced differences in hydrographic setting of the coring sites provide palaeoenvironmental information of both local and more regional character. Five diatom zones were identified from the subfossil diatom records, each describing a hydrographic setting. Two major climate periods, the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' (AD 800-1250) and the 'Little Ice Age' (AD 1580-1850), that were separated by a variable transitional period, were recognized. Prior to these periods, a cold and presumably moist climate regime prevailed between AD 500 and 700. Cooling events were identified during the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' in the period AD 960 to 1140. The diatom data demonstrate that marked hydrographic changes occurred in the course of a relatively short timespan beginning at about AD 1300 and culminating around AD 1500. These changes occur during a crucial period in which the Norse are believed to have disappeared from South Greenland. Thus, our results support the hypothesis proposing that one of the main reasons for the loss of the Norse settlements was climatic deterioration. | ['heinemeier', 'jensen', 'koc', 'kuijpers'] | ","['heinemeier', 'jensen', 'koc', 'kuijpers']",4
61,"Diatom oxygen isotopes in pro-glacial lake sediments from northern Sweden: a 5000 year record of atmospheric circulation | We use a pro-glacial oxygen isotope record of diatom silica (delta(18)O(diatom)) and a sedimentary proxy for glacier fluctuations to determine centennial-millennial scale climate change during the last 5000 years in northern Sweden. We show that the lake water isotopic composition predominantly reflects the isotopic composition of the precipitation. Superimposed on a general depletion trend of 3.5parts per thousand over the past 5000 years we found that the isotopic composition of precipitation became depleted ( > 1parts per thousand excursions) during four occasions centered at 4400, 3000, 2000, and after 1200 cal yr BP. Climate simultaneously sustained a positive glacier mass balance, that Caused the catchment glacier to advance. A persistent change in the atmospheric circulation pattern could potentially have caused the registered changes in delta(18)O(diatom) because different air masses hold characteristic delta(18)O signatures of their precipitation. The glacier mass balance primarily responds to the influence of summer temperature oil ablation. We suggest that the most likely cause For the recorded changes in both these proxies is a steadily increasing but fluctuating dominance of colder and delta(18)O depleted air masses from the north/northeast during the past 5000 years. The delta(18)O(diatom) depletion and glacier events all occur at times of relative ice-rafted-debris maxima in the North Atlantic, consistent with cold conditions and changes in surface wind directions. Our results confirm that changes towards a predominance of north/northeasterly winds occurred at these time intervals. (C)2004 Elsevier Ltd.

62,"Diatom responses to 20th century climate-related environmental changes in high-elevation mountain lakes of the northern Canadian Cordillera | Diatom responses to 20th century climate-related environmental change were assessed from three high-elevation lakes in the northern Canadian Cordillera. Dominance of small benthic Fragilaria diatoms reflect the generally cold conditions with long periods of ice cover that have characterized these mountain lakes over at least the last similar to 300 years until the period of recent warming. At the turn of the 20th century, salient shifts in the diatom assemblages reveal individualistic limnological responses with the onset of climate warming trends in northwest Canada. At YK3 Lake, an oligotrophic, chemically dilute, alpine lake, increased representation of the planktonic Cyclotella pseudostelligera may reflect longer ice-free conditions and/or more stable thermal strati. cation. By contrast, in the more productive, alkaline lakes (BC2 and Deadspruce lakes), changes to more diverse assemblages of periphytic diatoms suggest greater benthic habitat availability, most likely associated with the enhanced growth of aquatic plants with lengthening of the growing seasons. In addition, diatom assemblages from these lakes suggest less alkaline conditions following the onset of 20th century climate warming. Continued alkalinity reduction throughout the 20th century is qualitatively inferred at the lower elevation, treeline lake (Deadspruce Lake), while greater representation of alkaliphilous Fragilaria diatoms after similar to 1950 suggested increased alkalinity at the alpine BC2 Lake. Our results confirm the sensitivity of diatoms from high-elevation mountain lakes to regional climate change in northwest Canada. Individualistic limnological responses to 20th century warming are potentially attributed to differences in their physical setting (e. g., bedrock geology, elevation, catchment vegetation) in this complex mountain environment. | ['karst', 'riddoch', 'pisaric', 'smol'] | ","['karst', 'riddoch', 'pisaric', 'smol']",4
63,"Diatoms reveal complex spatial and temporal patterns of recent limnological change in West Greenland | Diatoms in sediment cores were analysed across a range of stratigraphic resolutions along a transect of 23 lakes spanning the ice-free margin of the west coast of Greenland (similar to 67A degrees N), to explore spatial and temporal patterns of recent (last similar to 150 years) environmental change in the region. These records display heterogeneous lake development trajectories over the last several centuries. Estimates of species composition turnover (beta-diversity) since 1850 AD are among the lowest for lakes in the Arctic, and are comparable to ""unimpacted"" reference lakes from temperate regions. Most of the change that occurred in West Greenland lakes pre-dates potential industrial anthropogenic effects, while post-1850 change is well within the natural range of variability for these systems. Nonetheless, a spatial pattern in core ""top-bottom"" changes is apparent across the transect: lakes in the arid interior of the region, adjacent to the ice sheet, and those with higher pH, register greater change than those in the more maritime climate of the coast. This suggests that climate plays an indirect role in the recent development of these lakes, and that recent anthropogenic forcing has not yet exceeded major ecological thresholds in this region. | ['anderson', 'douglas', 'perren'] | ","['anderson', 'douglas', 'perren']",1
64,"The distribution and abundance of chironomids in high-latitude Eurasian lakes with respect to temperature and continentality: development and application of new chironomid-based climate-inference models in northern Russia | The large landmass of northern Russia has the potential to influence global climate through amplification of climate change. Reconstructing climate in this region over millennial timescales is crucial for understanding the processes that affect the global climate system. Chironomids, preserved in lake sediments, have the potential to produce high resolution, low error, quantitative summer air temperature reconstructions. Canonical correspondence analysis of modern surface sediments from high-latitude lakes, located in northern European Russia and central Siberia, suggests that mean July air temperature is the most significant variable explaining chironomid distribution and abundance. This strong relationship enabled the development of a chironomid-based mean July air temperature-inference model based on 81 lakes and 89 taxa which has a r(jack)(2) = 0.92 and RMSEP = 0.89 degrees C. Comparison of taxon responses to July temperature between this Russian and existing Norwegian data-sets shows that the temperature optima of individual taxa were between 1 and 3 degrees C higher in the Russian data regardless of modelling technique. Reconstructions based on fossil assemblages from a Russian tundra lake core (VORK5) using a Norwegian chironomid-based inference model provide mean July air temperature estimates that are 1.0-2.7 degrees C colder than from the 81-lake Russian model and are also lower than the instrumental record from a nearby meteorological station. The Norwegian model also did not reconstruct decadal-scale fluctuations in temperature seen in the instrumental record. These observations suggest that chironomid-based inference models should only be applied to sediment cores which have similar climate regimes to the geographic area of the training set. In addition a 149 lake, 120 taxa chironomid-based continentality inference model was also developed from the modern Norwegian and Russian training sets. A 2-component WA-PLS model was the minimal adequate model with r(jack)(2) = 0.73 and RMSEP = 9.9 using the Gorczynski continentality index. Comparison of reconstructed continentality indices from the tundra lake, VORK5, show close agreement with local instrumental records over the past 70 years and suggest that the model is reliable. Recent warming in the Arctic has been spatially and seasonally heterogeneous; in many areas warming is more pronounced in the spring and autumn leading to a lengthening of the summer, while summer temperatures have remained relatively stable. A continentality inference model has the potential to detect these seasonal changes in climate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

65,"Drastic desalination of small lakes in East Siberia (Russia) in the early twentieth century: inferred from sedimentological, geochemical and palynological composition of small lakes | Reconstruction of temporal and spatial climate development on a seasonal basis during the last few centuries may help us better understand modern-day interplay between natural and anthropogenic climate variability. The objective of this paper is to reconstruct hydrology and landscape changes of East Siberia during the termination of the Little Ice Age and the subsequent Recent Warming. We analysed sediment samples from the saltwater Sulfatnoe Lake, Bolshoye Alginskoe and freshwater Shuchie Lake using high-resolution X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at 1-mm scan resolution, Fourier-transform infrared techniques and pollen analyses. The depth-age models of the cores were constructed by Pb-210 activity using the constant rate of supply model. The lake sediment cover of these lakes began to form from ca. 1870. Three significant periods (1870-1895, 1895-1925 and from 1925 to the present) were defined in hydrology and chemical regime of these lakes for the past 140 years. Lake levels were extremely low and high saturated with salts during the final period of the Little Ice Age. Lake levels began to slowly rise from 1870 to 1895 and vegetation was poor at that period. Intensive desalination of the lakes occurred in 1895-1925, and environment conditions were temperate and favourable for the majority of the taxa of the regional vegetation. Regional precipitation significantly increased and water saturation of the catchments was high from 1925 to the present. The chemical precipitation of carbonate stopped completely in Lake Shichie and reduced considerably in Lake Sulfatnoe and B. Alginskoe. Strong increasing trend of weathering of the lake catchments began in 1970 and still continues. | ['enushchenko', 'fedotov', 'krapivina', 'melgunov', 'petrovskii', 'phedorin', 'sklyarova', 'vershinin', 'vologina'] | ","['enushchenko', 'fedotov', 'krapivina', 'melgunov', 'petrovskii', 'phedorin', 'sklyarova', 'vershinin', 'vologina']",2
66,"A Driftwood-Based Record of Arctic Sea Ice During the Last 500 Years From Northern Svalbard Reveals Sea Ice Dynamics in the Arctic Ocean and Arctic Peripheral Seas | We present a 500-year history of naturally felled driftwood incursion to northern Svalbard, directly reflecting regional sea ice conditions and Arctic Ocean circulation. Provenance and age determinations by dendrochronology and wood anatomy provide insights into Arctic Ocean currents and climatic conditions at a fine spatial resolution, as crossdating with reference chronologies from the circum-Arctic boreal forests enables determination of the watershed the driftwood originated from. Sample crossdating may result in a wide range of matches across the pan-boreal region, which may be biased toward regions covered by the reference chronologies. Our study considers alternate approaches to selecting probable origin sites, by weighting scores via reference chronology span and visualizing results through spatiotemporal density plots, as opposed to more basic ranking systems. As our samples come from naturally felled trees (not logged or both), the relative proportions of different provenances are used to infer past ocean current dominance. Our record indicates centennial-to decadal-scale shifts in source regions for driftwood incursion to Svalbard, aligning with Late Holocene high variability and high frequency shifts in the Transpolar Drift and Beaufort Gyre strengths and associated fluctuating climate conditions. Driftwood occurrence and provenance also track the northward ice formation shift in peripheral Arctic seas in the past century. A distinct decrease in driftwood incursion during the last 30 years matches the observed decline in pan-Arctic sea ice extent in recent decades. Our new approach successfully employs driftwood as a proxy for Arctic Ocean surface circulation and sea ice dynamics. | ['farnsworth', 'hole', 'ingolfsson', 'macias', 'fauria', 'rawson', 'schomacker'] | ","['farnsworth', 'hole', 'ingolfsson', 'macias', 'fauria', 'rawson', 'schomacker']",1
67,"Driftwood as an indicator of relative changes in the influx of Arctic and Atlantic water into the coastal areas of Svalbard | A total of 276 driftwood samples from Wijdefjorden on the northern coast of Spitsbergen were dendrochronologically analysed and compared with results from a similar study on driftwood from Isfjorden. The composition and origin of the driftwood from the two places differ. Whereas Larix is almost absent in the Isfjorden driftwood, it comprises 25% of the Wijdefjorden collection. The Isfjorden driftwood has its main origin in the White Sea region and the dates of the driftwood concentrate around the period from 1950 to 1979, with only a few dates from the period 1910 to 1950. The Wijdefjorden driftwood has two main origins: Siberia and the White Sea region. The dates of the White Sea components of the Wijdefjorden driftwood are concentrated mainly in the period 1910-1950. The dates of the Siberian (Yenisey) components of the Wijdefjorden driftwood are concentrated in the period 1950-1979. It can be argued that during the time period from ca. 1910 to 1950 the activity of a warm northerly flowing current along the western coast of Spitsbergen was stronger, transporting White Sea driftwood all the way to the Widjdefjorden area. However, after ca. 1950 the input of White Sea driftwood decreased, and the relative importance of the Siberian component increased. These results fit well with the climatic records from Svalbard, showing a warm regime during the first half of this century due to increased activity of the warm West Spitsbergen Current along the western coast of Spitsbergen. After ca. 1950, the influx of Atlantic Water became weaker, the climate became colder and the relative occurrences of Siberian driftwood transported by the Transpolar Current increased on the northern coast of the Svalbard archipelago. | ['eggertsson'] | ",['eggertsson'],2

The overall regression was interrupted by two minor transgressions during the late Younger Dryas and in early Preboreal, and these were probably caused by a combination of expansions of local ice caps and readvances of the Icelandic inland ice-sheet margin. Maximum absolute uplift rates are recorded during the regressional phase between the two transgressions (10 000-9850 BP), with a mean value of c. 15 cm cntdot 14C yr-1 or 11-12 cm cntdot cal. yr-1.

71,"Early Holocene climate variability and the timing and extent of the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) in northern Iceland | The magnitude and timing of Holocene maximum warmth in the Arctic and sub-Arctic has been the subject of considerable recent interest, particularly in the context of future climate change. Although lying at a crucial location in the North Atlantic close to significant atmospheric and oceanic boundaries, terrestrial Holocene climatic data from Iceland are few and predominantly derive from glacial and palaeoecological evidence. Here we present new datasets from Trollaskagi, based on chironomid-inferred temperatures (CI-T), using subfossil chironomids from the same lake sediments supplemented by pollen data. July air temperatures have been derived using an Icelandic training set, and the data suggest optimal temperatures at sea level up to 1.5 degrees C above current levels around 8 kcal. yr BP, a time when birch woodland was well developed in Trollaskagi, but when woodland had still not fully developed in the more isolated NW peninsula. Our data thus suggest that optimal summer warmth did not occur in Iceland until 8 kcal. yr BP at the earliest, possibly lasting until 6.7 kcal. yr BP. The amount of warming for July was therefore at least 1.5 degrees C, but possibly up to 2-3 degrees C higher than the 1961-1990 average on the basis of the tree-line data. Comparison with data from elsewhere in adjacent Arctic regions, Greenland and Eastern Arctic Canada show peak warmth to be later in Iceland, and less pronounced. It also appears that there were enhanced temperature gradients during the first half of the Holocene between the two study areas Trollaskagi and the NW Peninsula and that they influenced patterns of vegetation colonisation, with current spatial temperature patterns only developing as Holocene climate deteriorated after around 6 kcal. yr BP.

73,"Early to middle Holocene changes in Laptev Sea water masses deduced from diatom and aquatic palynomorph assemblages | On the basis of diatom and aquatic palynomorph assemblages in sediment cores obtained from the eastern Laptev Sea shelf, major phases of environmental change associated with the last postglacial global sea-level rise can be recognized for the time since 11.3 calendar years BP (cal. ka). Until 11 cal. ka, the outer Laptev Sea shelf (>= 51 m paleodepth) was inundated and paleoenvironmental conditions were characterized by increased precipitation of river-loaded matter, primarily diatom plankton, in a river-proximal environment where reconstructed surface water salinities, using freshwater diatoms as proxy, remained below 9. The time interval 10.7-9.2 cal. ka was marked by a predominance of the dinoflagellate cyst Operculodinium centrocarpum as well as by the appearance of relatively warm-water indicative species in the outer Laptev Sea, probably due to enhanced influence of Atlantic Water at the continental margin. Because a continuously rising sea level resulted in an increasing distance between the investigated site and the southward retreating coastline, surface-water salinities on the outer shelf approached modem values of about 15-16 around 8.6 cal. ka. On the inner Laptev Sea shelf, modem-like environmental conditions were reached about I to 1.5 ky later, around 7.4 cal. ka, emphasizing the overwhelming influence of the global transgression on the Holocene evolution of Arctic shelf water masses.

76,"Efstadalsvatn: A multi-proxy study of a Holocene lacustrine sequence from NW Iceland | Multi-proxy data, both lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic, are presented from Efstadalsvatn, a lake in NW Iceland. The sequence covers the period 10,000 to 3500 14C yr B.P. The biostratgraphic data include the first Icelandic chironomid-based reconstruction of Holocene mean July air temperatures, using a Norwegian training set in the absence of modern Icelandic data. The results show that deglaciation and ecosystem development probably began before 10,000 14C yr B.P. and that July temperatures were around 4degreeC at ca. 9500 14C yr B.P. Temperatures then rose to ca. 8degreeC at the time of the deposition of the Saksunarvatn tephra (9100 14C yr B.P.), reaching ca. 10degreeC by 8500 14C yr B.P., high enough for the growth of tree birch, although successful birch colonisation did not take place until 6750 14C yr B.P. There is some evidence for cooling immediately preceding 9100 14C yr B.P. There is little firm biostratigraphic evidence for the 8200 cal. B.P. event, although this may be due to a relatively low resolution pollen sampling interval, but there are changes at this time in the total carbon (TC) and mass susceptibility (MS) data. Optimal temperatures and relative vegetation stability may have occurred between 8000-6100 14C yr B.P. but the chironomid assemblages indicate higher temperatures after 5000 14C yr B.P. This latter interpretation may, however, reflect delayed colonisation of thermophilous taxa and requires further investigation. There is evidence in the lithostratigraphy for greater local terrestrial instability after 6100 14C yr B.P. but it seems unlikely that this led to the redevelopment of ice in the catchment. The biostratigraphic records appear to show a degree of resistance to climate forcing throughout the early and middle Holocene. The new chironomid-based temperature reconstruction needs to be refined by further studies in Iceland, particularly the development of an Icelandic training set, but has already demonstrated the problems of paleoclimatic interpretations based on pollen and/or macrofossil evidence alone. | ['caseldine', 'geirsdottir', 'langdon'] | ","['caseldine', 'geirsdottir', 'langdon']",1
77,"Environmental Conditions of the Laptev Sea Region in the Late Postglacial Time | The comparison between the first results of comprehensive micropaleontological analysis (pollen, spores, foraminifera, and ostracods) and those of radiocarbon dating (AMS(14)C) for the sediments of the eastern inner shelf of the Laptev Sea (the core collected from depth of 37 m) indicates that considerable changes in natural conditions in the sea and on land coincide in time and refer to the time period of 1500-1700 years B.P. This period is characterized by changes in microfossils: appearance of thermophilic pollen and planktonic foraminifera and increase in total number of benthic foraminifera and ostracods. Intense warming and humidification of the climate reconstructed for this 200-year period promoted the expansion of large-shrub tundra. Summer air temperatures were lower than that in the peak mid-Holocene climatic optimum by 2 - 3 degrees C, but 1 degrees C higher than the present-day temperature. An estuary freshwater basin developed: it was strongly affected by river discharge, but North Atlantic waters also intensely penetrated here in short-term intervals. In general, the studied microfossil complex reflects the relatively stable environmental conditions and decrease in seawater salinity in the eastern part of the Laptev Sea shelf during the last 2300 years. | ['naidina'] | ",['naidina'],1
78,"Arctic environmental change of the last four centuries | A compilation of paleoclimate records from lake sediments, trees, glaciers, and marine sediments provides a view of circum-Arctic environmental variability over the last 400 years. From 1840 to the mid-20th century, the Arctic warmed to the highest temperatures in four centuries. This warming ended the Little Ice Age in the Arctic and has caused retreats of glaciers, melting of permafrost and sea ice, and alteration of terrestrial and lake ecosystems. Although warming, particularly after 1920, was likely caused by increases in atmospheric trace gases, the initiation of the warming in the mid-19th century suggests that increased solar irradiance, decreased volcanic activity, and feedbacks internal to the climate system played roles. | ['bradley', 'case', 'douglas', 'finney', 'gajewski', 'hardy', 'hughen', 'jacoby', 'jennings', 'lamoureux', 'lasca', 'macdonald', 'moore', 'overpeck', 'retelle', 'smith', 'wolfe', 'zielinski'] | ","['bradley', 'case', 'douglas', 'finney', 'gajewski', 'hardy', 'hughen', 'jacoby', 'jennings', 'lamoureux', 'lasca', 'macdonald', 'moore', 'overpeck', 'retelle', 'smith', 'wolfe', 'zielinski']",4
79,"Environmental changes in Northern Iceland since the Younger Dryas inferred from periglacial slope deposits | The slopes in Northern Iceland show the widespread occurrence of solifluction features, indicative of an active periglacial environment due to annual mean temperatures around 3 degrees C at sea level and seasonal soil frost. In order to reconstruct periods with active and inactive solifluction in the past we excavated 18 solifluction lobes for analysing the sediment sequences. Dating of the sediments was realised mainly by tephrochronology and C-14. The oldest solifluction layer could be dated to the Younger Dryas (YD), just after the deglaciation of Northern Iceland. The early to mid Holocene up to the deposition of Hekla 3 Tephra (similar to 3 ka BP) is characterized by the accumulation of loess and tephra layers, which show no signs of secondary remobilisation or erosion, indicating stable slopes during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum (MCO). After the deposition of Hekla 3 Tephra and especially during the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA), solifluction reappeared in the profiles as a probable consequence of Neoglacial cooling. The results fit well with other proxies from Iceland (glacier variations, pollen), from North Atlantic marine cores and from Greenland ice records. | ['marti', 'veit', 'winiger'] | ","['marti', 'veit', 'winiger']",1
80,"Holocene environmental reconstruction from deltaic deposits in northeast Greenland | Terraces of different age in the Zackenberg delta, located at 74degreesN in northeast Greenland, have provided the opportunity for an interdisciplinary approach to the investigation of Holocene glacial, periglacial, pedological, biological and archaeological conditions that existed during and after delta deposition. The raised Zackenberg delta accumulated mainly during the Holocene Climatic Optimum, starting slightly prior to 9500 cal. yr BP (30 m a.s.l.) and continued until at least 6300 cal. yr BP (0.5 m a.s.l.). Evidence of sea-level change is based on conventional C-14 dates of shells from the marine delta bottomsets, C-14 AMS dating of macroscopic plant material from the foresets and of fluvial deposits. Arthropod and plant remains from 7960 cal. yr BP in the delta foresets include the oldest evidence of the arctic hare in Greenland and evidence of a rich herb flora slightly different from the modern flora. Empetrum nigrum and Salix herbacea remains indicate a summer temperature at least as high as today during delta deposition. Post-depositional nivation activity, dated by luminescence, lichenometry and Schmidt Hammer measurements indicate mainly late Holocene activity, at least since 2900 yr BP, including Little Ice Age (LIA) avalanche activity. Pedological analyses of fossil podsols in the Zackenberg delta, including C-14 AMS dating of selected organic rich B-horizons, show continued podsol development during the Holocene Climatic Optimum and into the subsequent colder period of the late Holocene, until 3000-2400 yr BP. A Neo-Eskimo house ruin found on the lower part of the delta, presently being eroded by the sea, is dated to AD 1800. It presumably was abandoned prior to AD 1869, and suggests that some of the last Eskimos that lived in northeast Greenland might have occupied the Zackenberg delta.

81,"Holocene environmental change in the Skallingen area, eastern North Greenland, based on a lacustrine record | A lacustrine record from a small lake, Lille Sneha SO, in the Skallingen area indicates that the region was deglaciated in the early Holocene, prior to 8000cal. a BP. Deglaciation was probably triggered by high temperatures, but it took more than 1000 years for the lake and the catchment to stabilize. Chironomids were amongst the first invertebrates to colonize the lake. The fossil chironomid assemblage is fairly rich and comparable to other records from further south in Greenland. The pioneer vegetation in the area consisted of mosses and herbaceous plants. The oldest remains of woody plants (Salix arctica) are dated to c.7700 cal. a BP, and remains of Dryas integrifolia appear at around 6700cal. a BP; these are the only woody plants recorded. Maximum concentrations of chironomids, maximum occurrence of ephippia of the water flea Daphnia pulex, highest organic matter contents and lowest minerogenic input from c. 7700 to 4400 cal. a BP probably reflect the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). The highest temperatures during the HTM are indicated around 7000 cal. a BP, when Salix arctica, which is considered a warmth-loving plant, had a maximum. Comparisons with Holocene records from East and North Greenland show similar immigration histories and similar trends, with the Little Ice Age as the coldest period during the Holocene, culminating about 150 years ago. Subsequent warming does not indicate environmental conditions comparable to the HTM yet at this stage. The occurrence of several warmth-demanding species particularly in the early Holocene sediments indicates redeposition and implies that temperatures in the past, most likely during an interglacial period, were significantly higher than during the HTM. | ['bennike', 'wagner'] | ","['bennike', 'wagner']",4
82,"Environmental Change and Terrestrial Resource Use by the Thule and Inuit of Labrador, Canada | The object of this study is to document how the Inuit on the northern coast of Labrador, Canada used terrestrial resources such as peat and wood during the Little Ice Age (LIA; A.D. 15001870). Paleoecological investigations consisting of pollen and macrofossil analyses were undertaken in conjunction with archaeological excavations at the Inuit winter settlement sites of Oakes Bay 1, located in the Nain region of north-central Labrador. Our data indicate that the major changes in terrestrial ecosystems of this coastal region were triggered by climate change. From ca. 5700 to 3000 cal. yr B.P., climatic conditions were relatively warm and moist. At ca. 3000 cal. yr B.P. conditions became significantly drier and colder, which corresponds to broader climatic trends during the Neoglacial period. At ca. 1000 cal. yr B.P., the reappearance of hygrophilic species and the establishment of Larix laricina provide evidence of a return to more humid conditions that in turn triggered the onset of the paludification of sandy terraces in the Dog Island region. Peat accumulation persisted after ca. 580 cal. yr B.P. likely due to the elevation of the frost table during the LIA. Elevated frost tables contributed to water saturation of the surface during the spring, creating conditions that were conducive to the preservation of organic material. Natural resources such as trees and peat were therefore readily available and more abundant during the LIA and extensively used by the Inuit for house construction and heating in the Dog Island region.

83,"Holocene environmental variability in southern Greenland inferred from lake sediments | Sediments from Qipisarqo Lake provide a continuous Holocene paleoenvironmental record from southern Greenland. Following deglaciation and glacio-isostatic emergence of the basin from the sea apprx9100 cal yr B.P., proxies of lake paleoproductivity, including biogenic silica and organic matter, increased markedly until 6000 cal yr B.P. and thereafter remained stable over the ensuing warm three millennia. Subsequent decreases in these proxies, most dramatically between 3000 and 2000 cal yr B.P., show the lake's responses to initial Neoglacial cooling. Intervals of ameliorated limnological conditions occurred between 1300 and 900 and between 500 and 280 cal yr B.P., briefly interrupting the decreasing trend in productivity that culminated in the Little Ice Age. Increased lake productivity during the latter half of the 20th century, which reflects the limnological response to circum-arctic warming, still has not reached peak Holocene values. The Neoglacial climate of the last 2000 yr includes the most rapid high-amplitude environmental changes of the past nine millennia. The Norse thus migrated around the North Atlantic Ocean region in the most environmentally unstable period since deglaciation. Lacustrine sediment records provide a context with which to consider future environmental changes in the Labrador Sea region. In particular, any future warming will be superposed on a regional climate system that is currently exhibiting highly unstable behavior at submillennial timescales. | ['kaplan', 'miller', 'wolfe'] | ","['kaplan', 'miller', 'wolfe']",4
84,"Episodic expansion of Drangajokull, Vestfiroir, Iceland, over the last 3 ka culminating in its maximum dimension during the Little Ice Age | Non-linear climate change is often linked to rapid changes in ocean circulation, especially around the North Atlantic. As the Polar Front fluctuated its latitudinal position during the Holocene, Iceland's climate was influenced by both the warm Atlantic currents and cool, sea ice-bearing Arctic currents. Drangajokull is Iceland's fifth largest ice cap. Climate proxies in lake sediment cores, dead vegetation emerging from beneath the ice cap, and moraine segments identified in a new DEM constrain the episodic expansion of the ice cap over the past 3 ka. Collectively, our data show that Drangajokull was advancing at similar to 320 BCE, 180 CE, 560 CE, 950 CE and 1400 CE and in a state of recession at similar to 450 CE, 1250 CE and after 1850 CE. The Late Holocene maximum extent of Drangajokull occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA), occupying 262 km(2), almost twice its area in 2011 CE and similar to 20% larger than recent estimates of its LIA dimensions. Biological proxies from the sediment fill in a high- and low-elevation lake suggest limited vegetation and soil cover at high elevations proximal to the ice cap, whereas thick soil cover persisted until similar to 750 CE at lower elevations near the coast. As Drangajokull expanded into the catchment of the high-elevation lake beginning at similar to 950 CE, aquatic productivity diminished, following a trend of regional cooling supported by proxy records elsewhere in Iceland. Correlations between episodes of Drangajokull's advance and the documented occurrence of drift ice on the North Icelandic Shelf suggest export and local production of sea ice influenced the evolution of NW Iceland's Late Holocene climate.

85,"Episodic Neoglacial snowline descent and glacier expansion on Svalbard reconstructed from the C-14 ages of ice-entombed plants | The response of the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere to the monotonic decline in summer insolation and variable radiative forcing during the Holocene has been one of irregular expansion culminating in the Little Ice Age, when most glaciers attained their maximum late Holocene dimensions. Although periods of intervening still-stand or ice-retreat can be reconstructed by direct dating of ice-recessional features, defining times of Neoglacial ice growth has been limited to indirect proxies preserved in distal archives. Here we report 45 precise radiocarbon dates on in situ plants emerging from beneath receding glaciers on Svalbard that directly date the onset of snowline descent and glacier expansion, entombing the plants. Persistent snowline lowering occurred between 4.0 and 3.4 ka, but with little additional persistent lowering until early in the first millennium AD. Populations of individual C-14 calendar age results and their aggregate calendar age probabilities define discrete episodes of vegetation kill and snowline lowering 240-340 AD, 410-540 AD and 670-750 AD, each with a lower snowline than the preceding episode, followed by additional snowline lowering between 1000 and 1220 AD, and between 1300 and 1450 AD. Snowline changes after 1450 AD, including the maximum ice extent of the Little Ice Age are not resolved by our collections, although snowlines remained lower than their 1450 AD level until the onset of modern warming. A time-distance diagram derived from a 250-m-long transect of dated ice-killed plants documents ice-margin advances similar to 750, similar to 1100 and after similar to 1500 AD, concordant with distributed vegetation kill ages seen in the aggregate data set, supporting our central thesis that vegetation kill ages provide direct evidence of snowline lowering and cryospheric expansion. The mid- to late-Holocene history of snowline lowering on Svalbard is similar to ELA reconstructions of Norwegian and Svalbard cirque glaciers, and consistent with a cryospheric response to the secular decline of regional summertime insolation and stepped changes in nearby surface ocean environments. The widespread exposure of entombed plants dating from the first millennium AD suggests that Svalbard's average summer temperatures of the past century now exceed those of any century since at least 700 AD, including medieval times. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

86,"A re-evaluation and spatial analysis of evidence for a Younger Dryas climatic reversal in Beringia | An objective classification of paleoclimatic proxies from 75 lake and peat records is used to re-evaluate data quality and inferred climatic patterns in Beringia during the Younger Dryas. Mapped data reveal coherent but spatially-complex regional patterns, suggesting the Younger Dryas was characterized by: (1) cooling in Southern Alaska, Eastern Siberia, and portions of Northeastern Siberia; and (2) uniform to warmer-than-present conditions through most of Central Alaska, Northeastern Siberia, and possibly the Russian Far East and Northern Alaska. The Beringian patterns correspond to distinctive large-scale climatic forcings, although in some locations further modified by more local influences, such as topography. General circulation models and modern synoptic climatology provide a conceptual framework for exploring possible mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. Forcings and associated climatic responses consistent with the proxy data include: (1) lowered sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Pacific reducing temperature and precipitation in Eastern Siberia; (2) intensified Aleutian low and lowered sea-surface temperatures causing cooler summers and higher winter precipitation in Southern Alaska; (3) stronger Pacific Subtropical High and an eastward shift of the East Asian Trough reducing summer temperatures in Southern Alaska and causing relative warmth in Northeastern Siberia; and (4) strong high pressure system producing warm, dry conditions in interior Alaska.

87,"Evidence for an early recent warm interval in northwestern Alaska | A warm interval that began at least 10,000 years ago and lasted until at least 8300 years ago is recorded in the coastal tundra covered area of northwestern Alaska by the presence of fossil wood of tree size or tree species, fossil beaver-gnawed wood found beyond the modern range of beaver, evidence of ice-wedge melting, buried soils, and soils that extend below the top of modern permafrost. Dating of the warm interval is based on eight radiocarbon dates. Although these do not provide tight control for either the beginning or the end, they permit the interpretation that the warm event began at the start of the worldwide, postglacial warming and that it ended at the time of the Anivik Lake glacial readvance in the Brooks Range. If this is correct, the early Recent warm interval and the ""postglacial thermal maximum"" recognized by Livingstone in the Brooks Range were separated by a period of cooler climate. Deposits 7200 and 3600 years old also record moments when the climate was warmer than at present in coastal northwestern Alaska. Although these may record a continuation of the early Recent warm period, it seems more likely that they represent later and separate brief intervals of warmer climate. A postglacial thermal maximum between 6000 and 3000 years ago is recorded by pollen profiles in the Brooks Range, but is not clearly recorded in the coastal areas of northwestern Alaska. We suggest that as sea level rose to near its present position, the accompanying maritime climate lowered summer temperatures in this coastal area during the time at which areas farther inland were experiencing the high temperatures of the postglacial thermal maximum. ¬© 1966, The Geological Society of America, Inc. | ['hopkins', 'mcculloch'] | ","['hopkins', 'mcculloch']",0
88,"Evolution and Paleohydrology of Glacial Lakes Barlow and Ojibway | The evolution of Lakes Barlow and Ojibway, two large ice-contact glacial lakes that covered parts of northern Ontario and western Quebec from about 10.1-8.0 ka BP, during the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, was reconstructed using deglaciation landforms, ice-flow indicaters inscribed on bedrock, C-14 dates of early postglacial vegetation accumulated in lake basins, the distribution of Mysis relicta (a biological indicator of lacustrine submergence), varve chronology, and a detailed photogrammetric survey of the lake limit. Although the rate of ice retreat varied greatly throughout the basin, the average rate in Lake Barlow-Ojibway was 450 m/year. Rates of ice retreat deduced from varve chronology were assessed using predictable relationships between the lake limit, the shoreline gradient, and the rate of relative uplift. Over a 590 km long profile, the gradient on the maximum elevation of the lake defines a parabola that is attributed to restrained rebound, although in part it could be due to the position of the profile with respect to the overall uplift pattern generated by the ice sheet. The life span of the lake determined from varve chronologoy (2110 years) shows excellent agreement with the age difference obtained between that of marine shells overlying Lake Ojibway sediments at its northern end in Hudson Bay, and the oldest radiocarbon ages on basal organics in lakes in the southern part of the Barlow-Ojibway basin. Both lakes drained eastward through the Ottawa River between 10.1 and 8.0 ka BP, and the average yearly discharge to the North Atlantic Ocean during the last 1000-1500 years is estimated at about 946 km(3). At break-up of the ice sheet in southern Hudson Bay at about 8.0 ka BP, Lake Ojibway drained abruptly, releasing an estimated 114,396 km(3) of freshwater into the Tyrrell Sea and raising sea level by about 30 cm. | ['veillette'] | ",['veillette'],0
89,"The expansion of Central and Northern European Neolithic populations was associated with a multi-century warm winter and wetter climate | It is still debated whether climate changes had an impact on the emergence, spread, and disappearance of early production-based (Neolithic) adaptations. To date, and despite the incorporation of various paleoclimatic proxies, there exists no spatial reconstruction of the regional impact of the North Atlantic cooling events on Central-Western European climate and environments during the early Holocene. In order to address these two issues, we estimated seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation from a marine pollen record from Trondheimsfjord (central Norway) along with 68 pollen records distributed across Central-Western Europe for the time period associated with the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) cultural tradition, 7600-6900 yr cal. BP. Two distinct vegetation-derived rapid, <100 years, climate changes, contemporaneous with reduced warm Atlantic water (AW) inflow and winter storminess in the northern North Atlantic, bracket the expansion of the LBK. The geographic expansion of LBK populations appears to coincide with winter warming by ca. 2.5 degrees C on average, and an increase in summer and winter precipitation, while its decline is associated with decreases in winter temperature, by similar to 1.5 degrees C on average, and summer rainfall. Our results confirm that LBK subsistence practices were well-adapted to wet and relatively warm winters and cool summers, which are favorable to some cultigens, such as einkorn. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that cooler and wetter climatic conditions would induce increased instability of agricultural communities leading to the decline of LBK populations. | ['bank', 'giraudeau', 'goni', 'hanquiez', 'leroyer', 'ortu'] | ","['bank', 'giraudeau', 'goni', 'hanquiez', 'leroyer', 'ortu']",4
90,"Fossil midges (Diptera : Chironomidae) as palaeoclimatic indicators for the Eurasian region | Chironomids (non-biting midges) have been used in palaeoenvironmental studies in Eurasia since the 1920s. Initially changes in chironomid assemblages were largely interpreted as a response to changes in trophic status or water depth. It was only with the advent of chironomid-temperature inference models in the early 1990s that their potential as palaeoclimatic indicators was fully exploited. This paper provides a brief review of the pioneering studies but focuses on the most recent advances. Better taxonomic resolution of fossil midges, expansion of modern training sets, use of air temperature data derived from meteorological stations rather than surface-water temperature data, and Bayesian statistical approaches have lead to improvements in the performance of chironomid-temperature transfer functions. Applications of these transfer functions to derive chironomid-inferred temperature estimates from Lateglacial (ca 15,000-11,200 cal. yr BP) and Holocene (11,200 cal. yr BP to Present) sequences from throughout Eurasia are reviewed in this paper. Chironomid-inferred Lateglacial reconstructions closely reflect oxygen isotope records from Greenland ice cores. Holocene reconstructions are less consistent. Some closely follow instrumental records or corroborate other proxy data, while other reconstructions are less successful. As a result of soil development during the Holocene, changes in pH, nutrients, DO and DOC had a greater influence than temperature on the composition of some midge assemblages. One way to mitigate this is through consensus temperature reconstructions from several sites in the same region. The challenge for future workers is for further improvement in taxonomic resolution of sub-fossil chironomid larvae, to improve further the performance of chironomid-temperature inference models, to develop training sets for southern Europe and Russia and to improve our understanding of the ecological responses of chironomids.

91,"Geochemical proxies of North American freshwater routing during the Younger Dryas cold event | The Younger Dryas cold interval represents a time when much of the Northern Hemisphere cooled from approximate to 12.9 to 11.5 kiloyears B.P. The cause of this event, which has long been viewed as the canonical example of abrupt climate change, was initially attributed to the routing of freshwater to the St. Lawrence River with an attendant reduction in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. However, this mechanism has recently been questioned because current proxies and dating techniques have been unable to confirm that eastward routing with an increase in freshwater flux occurred during the Younger Dryas. Here we use new geochemical proxies (Delta Mg/Ca, U/Ca, and Sr-87/Sr-86) measured in planktonic foraminifera at the mouth of the St. Lawrence estuary as tracers of freshwater sources to further evaluate this question. Our proxies, combined with planktonic delta O-18(seawater) and delta C-13, confirm that routing of runoff from western Canada to the St. Lawrence River occurred at the start of the Younger Dryas, with an attendant increase in freshwater flux of 0.06 +/- 0.02 Sverdrup (1 Sverdrup = 10(6) m(3)center dot s(-1)). This base discharge increase is sufficient to have reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and caused the Younger Dryas cold interval. In addition, our data indicate subsequent fluctuations in the freshwater flux to the St. Lawrence River of approximate to 0.06-0.12 Sverdrup, thus explaining the variability in the overturning circulation and climate during the Younger Dryas. | ['brook', 'carlson', 'clark', 'haley', 'klinkhammer', 'meissner', 'simmons'] | ","['brook', 'carlson', 'clark', 'haley', 'klinkhammer', 'meissner', 'simmons']",4

By Stage 2 valleys below 600 m a.s.l. (the Tarna Valley was an exception) had become free of ice. Stage 3 involved a retreat of small valley glaciers to about 700-800 m, major nunataks appeared on the high plateau, and outlet glaciers were considerably reduced in size. Stage 4 was characterized by a warmer and wetter climate (Mid-Atlantic chronozone, 6000-5000 yr BP) when timberline rose to about 900 m. This led to the development of Spodosols (podzols) under stands of dwarf pine in swale topography, This paleo-podzolic signature was not erased during alpine conditions that typified the Sub-Boreal (Stage 5) and Sub-Atlantic (Stage 6) chronozones that followed. These were periods of lower temperatures and with reduced precipitation initially during Stage 5. Precipitation increased during the Sub-Atlantic and, together with temperature, remained similar to the present. Human settlement began about 6000 yr BP and had a recognizable impact on the landscape. This activity accelerated during the Sub-Boreal and Sub-Atlantic, with more intensive use of the mountains for reindeer procurement.

The period of the last 200 years is sufficiently covered by the proxy information, including reconstructions with annual resolution. In this period the tree-rings, ice cores, boreholes, and glacier fluctuations recorded a 1. ¬∞C warming and a general glacier retreat, i.e. the transition from the Little Ice Age climate to the modern one. Although the proxies have different resolution, accuracy and seasonality in general they demonstrate a coherent picture of environmental changes in the last two centuries.

94,"Glacial and climate history of the last 24000years in the Polar Ural Mountains, Arctic Russia, inferred from partly varved lake sediments | We present a well-dated, high-resolution and continuous sediment record spanning the last c. 24000years from lake Bolshoye Shchuchye located in the Polar Ural Mountains, Arctic Russia. This is the first continuous sediment succession reaching back into the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ever retrieved from this region. We reconstruct the glacial and climate history in the area since the LGM based on sedimentological and geochemical analysis of a 24-m-long sediment core. A robust chronology was established using a combination of AMS C-14-dating, the position of the Vedde Ash and varve counting. The varved part of the sediment core spans across the LGM from 24 to 18.7cal. ka BP. We conclude that the lake basin remained ice-free throughout the LGM, but that mountain glaciers were present in the lake catchment. A decrease in both glacial varve preservation and sedimentation rate suggests that these glaciers started to retreat c. 18.7cal. ka BP and had disappeared from the catchment by 14.35cal. ka BP. There are no indications of glacier regrowth during the Younger Dryas. We infer a distinct climatic amelioration following the onset of the Holocene and an Early to Middle Holocene thermal optimum between 10-5cal. ka BP. Our results provide a long-awaited continuous and high-resolution record of past climate that supplements the existing, more fragmentary data from moraines and exposed strata along river banks and coastal cliffs around the Russian Arctic. | ['haflidason', 'mangerud', 'regnell', 'svendsen'] | ","['haflidason', 'mangerud', 'regnell', 'svendsen']",4
95,"Glacial and environmental changes over the last 60000years in the Polar Ural Mountains, Arctic Russia, inferred from a high-resolution lake record and other observations from adjacent areas | Our knowledge about the glaciation history in the Russian Arctic has to a large extent been based on geomorphological mapping supplemented by studies of short stratigraphical sequences found in exposed sections. Here we present new geochronological data from the Polar Ural Mountains along with a high-resolution sediment record from Bolshoye Shchuchye, the largest and deepest lake in the mountain range. Seismic profiles show that the lake contains a 160-m-thick sequence of unconsolidated lacustrine sediments. A well-dated 24-m-long core from the southern end of the lake spans the last 24cal. ka. From downward extrapolation of sedimentation rates we estimate that sedimentation started about 50-60 ka ago, most likely just after a large glacier had eroded older sediments from the basin. Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating (Be-10) of boulders and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of sediments indicate that this part of the Ural Mountains was last covered by a coherent ice-field complex during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4. A regrowth of the glaciers took place during a late stage of MIS 3, but the central valleys remained ice free until the present. The presence of small- and medium-sized glaciers during MIS 2 is reflected by a sequence of glacial varves and a high sedimentation rate in the lake basin and likewise from Be-10 dating of glacial boulders. The maximum extent of the mountain glaciers during MIS 2 was attained prior to 24cal. ka BP. Some small present-day glaciers, which are now disappearing completely due to climate warming, were only slightly larger during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) as compared to AD 1953. A marked decrease in sedimentation rate around 18-17cal. ka BP indicates that the glaciers then became smaller and probably disappeared altogether around 15-14cal. ka BP. | ['faerseth', 'gyllencreutz', 'haflidason', 'henriksen', 'hovland', 'lohne', 'mangerud', 'nazarov', 'regnell', 'schaefer', 'svendsen'] | ","['faerseth', 'gyllencreutz', 'haflidason', 'henriksen', 'hovland', 'lohne', 'mangerud', 'nazarov', 'regnell', 'schaefer', 'svendsen']",2
96,"Glacial history of the Greenland Ice Sheet and a local ice cap in Qaanaaq, northwest Greenland | In this study, we present new information on the glacial history of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and a local ice cap in Qaanaaq, northwest Greenland. We use geomorphological mapping, Be-10 exposure dating of boulders, analysis of lake cores, and C-14 dating of reworked marine molluscs and subfossil plants to constrain the glacial history. Our C-14 ages of reworked marine molluscs reveal that the ice extent in the area was at or behind its present-day position from 42.2 +/- 0.4 to 30.6 +/- 0.3k cal a BP after which the GrIS expanded to its maximum position during the Last Glacial Maximum. We find evidence of early ice retreat in the deep fjord (Inglefield Bredning) at 11.9 +/- 0.6 ka whereas the Taserssuit Valley was deglaciated similar to 4 ka later at 7.8 +/- 0.1k cal a BP. A proglacial lake record suggests that the local ice cap survived the Holocene Thermal Maximum but moss kill-dates reveal that it was smaller than present for a period of time before 3.3 +/- 0.1k until 0.9 +/- 0.1k cal a BP, following which the ice in the area expanded towards its Little Ice Age extent.

97,"Holocene Glacial and Tree Line Variations in the White River Valley and Skolai Pass Alaska USA and Yukon Territory Canada | Complex glacier and tree-line fluctuations in the White River valley on the northern flank of the St. Elias and Wrangell Mountains in S Alaska [USA] and Yukon Territory [Canada] are recognized by detailed moraine maps and drift stratigraphy, and are dated by dendrochronology, lichenometry, 14C ages, and stratigraphic relations of drift to the eastern (1230 14C yr B.P.) and northern (1980 14C yr B.P.) lobes of the White River Ash. Two major intervals of expansion, one concurrent with the well-known and widespread Little Ice Age and the other dated between 2900 and 2100 14C yr B.P., with a culmination about 2600 and 2800 14C yr B.P., were found. The ages of Little Ice Age moraines suggest fluctuating glacier expansion between A.D. 1500 and the early 20th century. Much of the 20th century experienced glacier recession, it would probably be premature to declare the Little Ice Age over. The complex moraine systems of the older expansion interval lie immediately downvalley from Little Ice Age moraines, suggesting that the 2 expansion intervals represent similar events in the Holocene, and that the Little Ice Age is not unique. Another very short-lived advance occurred about 1230-1050 14C yr B.P. Spruce immigrated into the valley to a minimum altitude of 3500 ft (1067 m), about 600 ft (183 m) below the current spruce tree line of 4100 ft (1250 m), at least by 8020 14C yr B.P. Subsequent intervals of high tree line were in accord with glacier recession; several spruce-wood deposits above current tree line occur bedded between Holocene tills. High deposits of fossil wood range up to 76 m above present tree line and are dated at about 5250, 3600-3000, and 2100-1230 14C yr B.P. St. Elias glacial and tree-line fluctuations, which probably are controlled predominantly by summer temperature and by length of the growing and ablation seasons, correlate closely with a detailed Holocene tree-ring curve from California, suggesting a degree of synchronism of Holocene summer-temperature changes between the 2 areas. This synchronism is strengthened by comparison with the glacier record from British Columbia and Mt. Rainier. Broad synchronism of Holocene events exists across the Arctic between the St. Elias Mountains and Swedish Lappland. Two sequences from the Southern Hemisphere show similar records, in so far as dating allows. Broad synchronism of Holocene climatic fluctuations in several regions is possible although further data are needed and several areas, particularly Colorado and Baffin Island, show major differences in the regional pattern. | ['denton', 'karlen'] | ","['denton', 'karlen']",4

99,"Holocene glacier fluctuations in Alaska | This review summarizes forefield and lacustrine records of glacier fluctuations in Alaska during the Holocene. Following retreat from latest Pleistocene advances, valley glaciers with land-based termini were in retracted positions during the early to middle Holocene. Neoglaciation began in some areas by 4.0 ka and major advances were underway by 3.0 ka, with perhaps two distinct early Neoglacial expansions centered respectively on 3.3-2.9 and 2.2-2.0 ka. Tree-ring cross-dates of glacially killed trees at two termini in southern Alaska show a major advance in the AD 550s-720s. The subsequent Little Ice Age (LIA) expansion was underway in the AD 1180s-1320s and culminated with two advance phases respectively in the 1540s-1710s and in the 1810s-1880s. The LIA advance was the largest Holocene expansion in southern Alaska, although older late Holocene moraines are preserved on many forefields in northern and interior Alaska. Tidewater glaciers around the rim of the Gulf of Alaska have made major advances throughout the Holocene. Expansions were often asynchronous with neighboring termini and spanned both warm and cool intervals, suggesting that non-climatic factors were important in forcing these advances. However, climatic warming appears to have initiated most rapid iceberg-calving retreats. Large glaciers terminating on the forelands around the Gulf of Alaska may have had tidewater termini early in the Holocene, but have progressively become isolated from the adjacent ocean by the accumulation and subaerial exposure of their own sediments.

100,"Holocene glacier fluctuations, Waskey Lake, northeastern Ahklun Mountains, southwestern Alaska | Lake sediments from Waskey Lake, Ahklun Mountains, southwestern Alaska were studied to decipher the history of upvalley glacier fluctuations during the Holocene. Several indicators of glacier activity were measured including: magnetic susceptibility, organic-matter content, grain-size distribution, bulk-sediment mineralogy and diatom assemblages. Seven radiocarbon ages on macrofossils, along with cross-checks by tephrochronology, provide the chronology of the cores. The results from core WL-1 indicate that glaciers lingered near Waskey Lake until 9100 cal. yr BP, perhaps under conditions of high winter accumulation. Peak organic-matter content occurs at 7400 cal. yr BP, when precipitation might have shifted to summer. The onset of Neoglaciation occurred 3100 cal. yr BP, and glaciers reached their maximum extent similar to700 cal. yr BP. This chronology is consistent with the lichenometrically dated moraines from the glacier forefields. Although the ages are tentative, the youngest and most widespread group of moraines was deposited sometime between 650 and 200 cal. yr BP (during the 'Little Ice Age'). Since then, glaciers in the Waskey Lake area have shrunk by similar to50% and equilibrium-line altitudes (ELA) have risen by 35 +/- 22 m. This rise in ELA is much less than the 100 to 200 m rise observed elsewhere in Alaska and indicates considerable spatial variability in late-Holocene climatic change. | ['kaufman', 'levy', 'werner'] | ","['kaufman', 'levy', 'werner']",2
101,"Glacier Margin Fluctuations during the 19th and 20th Centuries in the Ikamiut-Kangerdluarssuat Area West Greenland | Lichenometric dating suggests that the maximum recent extent of cirque and small valley glaciers occurred before about A.D. 1850, although there is evidence for more extensive valley glacierization before about A.D. 1745. Between about 1850 and about 1968/1969 progressive recession of the glaciers was interrupted by brief periods of reactivation during the 1880s, 1920s and early 1940s. Since about 1968/1969, the glacier fronts have advanced by up to 158 m following a marked climatic recession during the 1960s and early 1970s. In general, fluctuations of the glaciers have been in sympathy with prevailing climatic trends and show a relatively rapid response following temperature changes and a lagged response of at least 9 yr following precipitation changes. Fluctuations of larger valley and icefield outlet glaciers are out of phase with the others which may reflect a greater time lag of 20-30 yr in their response to precipitation changes. | ['gordon'] | ",['gordon'],4
102,"Glacier readvance during the late glacial (Younger Dryas?) in the Ahklun Mountains, southwestern Alaska | An expansion of alpine glaciers during the latest Pleistocene produced an extraordinarily well defined end moraine system in the Ahklun Mountains, southwestern Alaska. These moraines, deposited during the Mount Waskey advance, are several kilometers beyond modern glacier termini, and similar to80 km upvalley of the late Wisconsin Ahklun Mountains ice cap terminal moraine. Eleven cosmogenic Be-10 and Al-26 exposure ages on moraine boulders, combined with radiocarbon ages from a lake core upvalley of a moraine deposited during the Mount Waskey advance, suggest that the advance culminated between 12.4 and 11.0 ka, sometime during, or shortly following, the Younger Dryas event (ca. 12.9-11.6 ka). We believe that the Mount Waskey advance was a consequence of cooling during the Younger Dryas. These data further strengthen emerging evidence for Younger Dryas-age cooling of the North Pacific region. | ['briner', 'caffee', 'finkel', 'kaplan', 'kaufman', 'levy', 'manley', 'werner'] | ","['briner', 'caffee', 'finkel', 'kaplan', 'kaufman', 'levy', 'manley', 'werner']",0
103,"Global characterization of the Holocene Thermal Maximum | We analyze the global variations in the timing and magnitude of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) and their dependence on various forcings in transient simulations covering the last 9000 years (9 ka), performed with a global atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model. In these experiments, we consider the influence of variations in orbital parameters and atmospheric greenhouse gases and the early-Holocene deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice sheet (LIS). Considering the LIS deglaciation, we quantify separately the impacts of the background melt-water fluxes and the changes in topography and surface albedo. In the analysis we focus on the intensity of the maximum temperature deviation relative to the preindustrial level, its timing in the Holocene, and the seasonal expression. In the model, the warmest HTM conditions are found at high latitudes in both hemispheres, reaching 5 degrees C above the preindustrial level, while the smallest HTM signal is seen over tropical oceans (less than 0.5 degrees C). This latitudinal contrast is mostly related to the nature of the orbitally-forced insolation forcing, which is also largest at high latitudes, and further enhanced by the polar amplification. The Holocene timing of the HTM is earliest (before 8 ka BP) in regions not affected by the remnant LIS, particularly NW North America, E Asia, N Africa, N South America, the Middle East, NE Siberia and Australia. Compared to the early Holocene insolation maximum, the HTM was delayed by 2-3 ka over NE North America, and regions directly downwind from the LIS. A similar delay is simulated over the Southern Ocean, while an intermediate lag of about 1 ka is found over most other continents and oceans. The seasonal timing of the HTM over continents generally occurs in the same month as the maximum insolation anomaly, whereas over oceans the FITM is delayed by 2-3 months. Exceptions are the oceans covered by sea ice and North Africa, were additional feedbacks results in a different seasonal timing. The simulated timing and magnitude of the HTM are generally consistent with global proxy evidence, with some notable exceptions in the Mediterranean region, SW North America and eastern Eurasia.

104,"Global Pattern of Temperature Variability in Greenland and Antarctica and the Cooling Trend in the Last Millennia | A study of glacial-interglacial periods shows that, once ice sheets reach a critical maximal mass, the glaciation period changes to an interglacial one; the latter gives way to the following glaciation period, during which the ice sheet mass becomes minimal. The last interglacial period, the Holocene, has been going on for more than 10 ka; this raises the question of the timing of the end of the Holocene and the beginning of the upcoming glaciation. The retrieval of detailed information on the mechanisms of climate change is connected with the study of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, oceanic sediments, and continuous terrestrial proxy data. Long-term continuous data on the variability of land ice in Greenland and Antarctica provide valuable information on the climate variability pattern in the time intervals of the transition from glacial conditions to interglacial ones and vice versa. The data on temperature anomalies in Greenland and Antarctica are compared and analyzed here. The paper mainly focuses on the temperature variability pattern for the time interval of the transition from the last glacial maximum to the present moment (i.e., the temperature and trends in its changes are reconstructed). | ['dergachev'] | ",['dergachev'],3

106,"Historical and paleolimnological evidence for expansion of Lake Athabasca (Canada) during the Little Ice Age | A multi-proxy paleolimnological record obtained from a small, lowland closed-drainage basin located in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (Alberta, Canada), 10 km northwest of the present-day shore of Lake Athabasca, captures evidence of pronounced hydroecological changes over the past similar to 400 years. Consistent with historical maps produced by early European explorers of western Canada, paleolimnological data support the existence of a Lake Athabasca highstand during the Little Ice Age (LIA), c. 1600-1900 Common Era (CE). This contrasts with interpretations from previous analyses on sediment cores from an upland closed-drainage basin located centrally within the Peace sector of the delta that indicate low water levels during this interval. The different paleohydrological records at these two basins reflect the relative influence of different controls on the lake water balances. During the LIA, the lowland site was influenced by high levels in Lake Athabasca, whereas the elevated basin was outside the range of water-level rise in the lake and its distributaries, and was instead controlled by dry atmospheric conditions that led to evaporative drawdown. Integration of paleolimnological records and historical sources demonstrates that the ecosystem has undergone marked climate-driven hydroecological change over the past century, which is important information for effective management. | ['asada', 'clogg', 'wright', 'edward', 'hall', 'johnston', 'karst', 'riddoch', 'last', 'sinnatamby', 'sokal', 'vardy', 'wolfe', 'yi'] | ","['asada', 'clogg', 'wright', 'edward', 'hall', 'johnston', 'karst', 'riddoch', 'last', 'sinnatamby', 'sokal', 'vardy', 'wolfe', 'yi']",4
107,"Holocene History of Arctic Ice Shelves | The modern Ellesmere ice shelves constitute the oldest landfast sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere, originally described by late nineteenth century sledging expeditions. At that time, the 'Ellesmere Ice Shelf' formed a contiguous, coastal apron that extended hundreds of kilometres in length and covered up to 9000 km(2). By the mid-twentieth century the Ellesmere Ice Shelf was reduced to several large remnants and half its original area. Early efforts to document the age of ice shelf inception used conventional radiocarbon dating of internal, aeolian layers and marine organisms incorporated by basal accretion, all providing problematic results. The most widely cited age (3000 C-14 yr before present (BP)) was provided by a radiocarbon date on driftwood stranded behind the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf. Here we constrain the age of ice shelf inception based on 69 accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates on driftwood collected from raised marine shorelines inland of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, including adjacent fiords deglaciated -9500 cal yr BP. Driftwood entered Disraeli Fiord, behind the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, as well as Phillips Inlet to the east, continuously from 9500 to 5500 cal yr BP, after which it abruptly terminated until present. This termination is interpreted to record blockage of the coast by establishment of multiyear landfast sea ice, rather than the lack of driftwood availability due to changing ocean currents, because driftwood delivery continued farther east at several locations through the same interval. This driftwood delivery was favoured by the seasonal expansion of the Lincoln Sea polynya that extends from northern Nares Strait to Clements Markham Inlet. The radiocarbon chronology of entrapped driftwood behind the former Ellesmere Ice Shelf provides a proxy for the severity of Arctic Ocean pack ice with which it co-varies. This record extends back at least five millennia, far beyond the four decades of satellite surveillance, demonstrating that modern sea ice reduction extends back to the early twentieth century. The dramatic acceleration of seasonal pack ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean during the early twenty-first century heralds the imminent demise of the remaining ice shelf remnants across northern Ellesmere Island, considered an unprecedented event on the scale of millennia. Fiords adjacent to the former Ellesmere Ice Shelf-historically occupied by mulit-year landfast sea ice-have also become seasonally ice-free within the last decade. | ['england', 'evans', 'lakeman'] | ","['england', 'evans', 'lakeman']",4

109,"Hydroclimatic analysis of an ice-scar tree-ring chronology of a high-boreal lake in Northern Quebec, Canada | Ice-scars were investigated to reconstruct the ice-flood history of Corvette Lake in Northern Quebec in an attempt to determine the hydrological threshold of shore ice and identify the accompanying climatic conditions. The ice-scar record started around 1850 and showed a rapid increase in frequency at the start of the 1930s, while trees damaged by the ice were already mature and established over several decades. The study supports the hypothesis that this shift could correspond to an increase in flood discharge. Hydrological analysis of every event that occurred since 1961, the year during which instrumental recording began, indicated that scar frequency and scar maximum height were strongly correlated with average recession discharge, average flood discharge, peak discharge and flood onset. Ice-scars provided a discontinuous record of discrete events triggered by hydrologic extremes that were used to document the instrumental record using logistic regression. Results from multiple regressions suggested that ice-scars correspond to years with highs in total precipitation from January to March and from May to June, in the sum of degree-days of frost in April, and in the sum of degree-days of heat from October to April. Although imperfect for reconstructing past events, this study exemplifies the potential use of ice-scars for extending the historical record of ice-floods with hydroclimatic significance. | ['begin', 'lemay'] | ","['begin', 'lemay']",1
110,"Ice-cover is the principal driver of ecological change in High Arctic lakes and ponds | Recent climate change has been especially pronounced in the High Arctic, however, the responses of aquatic biota, such as diatoms, can be modified by site-specific environmental characteristics. To assess if climate-mediated ice cover changes affect the diatom response to climate, we used paleolimnological techniques to examine shifts in diatom assemblages from ten High Arctic lakes and ponds from Ellesmere Island and nearby Pim Island (Nunavut, Canada). The sites were divided a priori into four groups (""warm"", ""cool"", ""cold"", and ""oasis"") based on local elevation and microclimatic differences that result in differing lengths of the ice-free season, as well as about three decades of personal observations. We characterized the species changes as a shift from Condition 1 (i.e. a generally low diversity, predominantly epipelic and epilithic diatom assemblage) to Condition 2 (i.e. a typically more diverse and ecologically complex assemblage with an increasing proportion of epiphytic species). This shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2 was a consistent pattern recorded across the sites that experienced a change in ice cover with warming. The ""warm"" sites are amongst the first to lose their ice covers in summer and recorded the earliest and highest magnitude changes. The ""cool"" sites also exhibited a shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2, but, as predicted, the timing of the response lagged the ""warm"" sites. Meanwhile some of the ""cold"" sites, which until recently still retained an ice raft in summer, only exhibited this shift in the upper-most sediments. The warmer ""oasis"" ponds likely supported aquatic vegetation throughout their records. Consequently, the diatoms of the ""oasis"" sites were characterized as high-diversity, Condition 2 assemblages throughout the record. Our results support the hypothesis that the length of the ice-free season is the principal driver of diatom assemblage responses to climate in the High Arctic, largely driven by the establishment of new aquatic habitats, resulting in increased diversity and the emergence of novel growth forms and epiphytic species. | ['douglas', 'griffith', 'michelutti', 'smol', 'sugar'] | ","['douglas', 'griffith', 'michelutti', 'smol', 'sugar']",1
111,"Ice-dammed lake and ice-margin evolution during the Holocene in the Kangerlussuaq area of west Greenland | There is a lack of detailed information on the Holocene evolution of the west Greenland ice margin, not least because it was farther inland than at present and thus at present is covered by ice. Suggestions have been put forward, both of relatively quick ice-margin retreat and of relatively stable ice-margin positions. This study presents the first exploitation of sediments from an ice-dammed basin. Sediment that is rich in organic material records a period of time sufficient for vegetation to thrive; thus, without a lake and with a distal and diminished ice mass relative to the present. In contrast, sediment composed of suspension-settling deposits and with drop stones records an ice-dammed lake and a proximal calving ice-margin. Overall, we evidence relatively coarse-grained glacifluvial sedimentation predominantly from an ice-marginal delta and/or a proglacial, braided river soon after the early Holocene deglaciation of this area. Subsequent mid-Holocene aeolian activity deposited leaves, some vegetation (roots) developed in the basin, and ponding of water formed organic-rich ""gyttja"" sediments and thin layers of peat. The lake then became ice marginal, and ice advances are interpreted to have occurred at approximately 4000 cal. yr BP, and between 2776 +/- 26 cal. yr BP and 2440 +/- 45 cal. yr BP. The Little Ice Age ice-margin advance at Russell Glacier apparently reached its maximum extent after 147 +/- 39 cal. yr BP, whereas at lsunnguata Sermia the maximum could have been as early as 245 +/- 26 cal. yr BP. Given that ice-marginal lakes are becoming globally ubiquitous, improved resolution and new geological data on lake and ice-margin dynamics and interactions, such as ice-dammed lake-basin sediments, will be important for numerical models for assessing past and future ice-mass evolution. | ['carrivick', 'knudsen', 'kronborg', 'yde'] | ","['carrivick', 'knudsen', 'kronborg', 'yde']",4

113,"Impact processes, permafrost dynamics, and climate and environmental variability in the terrestrial Arctic as inferred from the unique 3.6¬†Myr record of Lake El'gygytgyn, Far East Russia ‚Äì A review | Lake El'gygytgyn in Far East Russia is a 3.6¬†Myr old impact crater lake. Located in an area that has never been affected by Cenozoic glaciations nor desiccation, the unique sediment record of the lake represents the longest continuous sediment archive of the terrestrial Arctic. The surrounding crater is the only impact structure on Earth developed in mostly acid volcanic rocks. Recent studies on the impactite, permafrost, and sediment sequences recovered within the framework of the ICDP ‚ÄúEl'gygytgyn Drilling Project‚Äù and multiple pre-site surveys yielded new insight into the bedrock origin and cratering processes as well as permafrost dynamics and the climate and environmental history of the terrestrial Arctic back to the mid-Pliocene. Results from the impact rock section recovered during the deep drilling clearly confirm the impact genesis of the El'gygytgyn crater, but indicate an only very reduced fallback impactite sequence without larger coherent melt bodies. Isotope and element data of impact melt samples indicate a F-type asteroid of mixed composition or an ordinary chondrite as the likely impactor. The impact event caused a long-lasting hydrothermal activity in the crater that is assumed to have persisted for c. 300¬†kyr. Geochemical and microbial analyses of the permafrost core indicate a subaquatic formation of the lower part during lake-level highstand, but a subaerial genesis of the upper part after a lake-level drop after the Aller√∏d. The isotope signal and ion compositions of ground ice is overprinted by several thaw-freeze cycles due to variations in the talik underneath the lake. Modeling results suggest a modern permafrost thickness in the crater of c. 340¬†m, and further confirm a pervasive character of the talik below Lake El'gygytgyn. The lake sediment sequences shed new leight into the Pliocene and Pleistocene climate and environmental evolution of the Arctic. During the mid-Pliocene, significantly warmer and wetter climatic conditions in western Beringia than today enabled dense boreal forests to grow around Lake El'gygytgyn and, in combination with a higher nutrient flux into the lake, promoted primary production. The exceptional warmth during the mid-Pliocene is in accordance with other marine and terrestrial records from the Arctic and indicates a period of enhanced ‚ÄúArctic amplification‚Äù. The favourable conditions during the mid-Pliocene were repeatedly interrupted by climate deteriorations, e.g., during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) M2, when pollen data and sediment proxies indicate a major cooling and the onset of local permafrost around the lake. A gradual vegetation change after c. 3.0¬†Ma points to the onset of a long-term cooling trend during the Late Pliocene that culminated in major temperature drops, first during MIS G6, and later during MIS 104. These cold events coincide with the onset of an intensified Northern Hemisphere (NH) glaciation and the largest extent of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, respectively. After the Pliocene/Pleistocene transition, local vegetation and primary production in Lake El'gygtygyn experienced a major change from relatively uniform conditions to a high-amplitude glacial-to-interglacial cyclicity that fluctuated on a dominant 41¬†kyr obliquity band, but changed to a 100¬†kyr eccentricity dominance during the Middle Pleistocene transition (MPT) at c. 1.2‚Äì0.6¬†Ma. Periods of exceptional warming in the Pleistocene record of Lake El'gygytgyn with dense boreal forests around and peaks of primary production in the lake are assigned to so-called ‚Äúsuper-interglacial‚Äù periods. The occurrence of these super-interglacials well corresponds to collapses of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) recorded in ice-free periods in the ANDRILL core, which suggests strong intrahemispheric teleconnections presumably driven by changes in the thermocline ocean circulation. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd | ['anderson', 'andreev', 'chapligin', 'fedorov', 'gebhardt', 'koeberl', 'lozhkin', 'melles', 'meyer', 'jacob', 'minyuk', 'nowaczyk', 'schwamborn', 'snyder', 'tarasov', 'wennrich', 'zhao'] | ","['anderson', 'andreev', 'chapligin', 'fedorov', 'gebhardt', 'koeberl', 'lozhkin', 'melles', 'meyer', 'jacob', 'minyuk', 'nowaczyk', 'schwamborn', 'snyder', 'tarasov', 'wennrich', 'zhao']",4
114,"Increased atmospheric dust deposition during the Neoglacial in a boreal peat bog from north-eastern Canada | Dust deposition in north-eastern Canada was estimated from the geochemical signature of a boreal peat bog from the James Bay lowlands. The rare earth elements and other lithogenic elements, as well as Nd isotopes were measured by Q-ICP-MS, ICP-OES and MC-ICP-MS, respectively along a 420 m peat core covering the last 7000 years. A principal component analysis performed on the geochemical dataset shows that REEs display the same chemical behavior as other lithogenic elements such as Al and Ti, which suggests that they are immobile in the peat column and can be used as tracers of dust deposition. After 4000 cal yr BP, peaks in dust deposition associated with greater variability in testate amoebae assemblages and plant macrofossil composition as well as a change in eNd values are observed. Between 7000 and 4100 cal yr BP, the eNd values varied from -36 to -29, while they gradually increased from 4100 cal yr BP until 1500 cal yr BP, suggesting proportionally less dust from local source(s) is deposited in favor of more regional source(s). From 1500 cal yr BP, sNd values remained relatively stable around -15 and -12. Most of the dust peaks correspond to documented cold and dry periods likely linked to intrusion of arctic air masses. A migration of the polar front might explain the more frequent intrusion of Arctic air masses in the region and the greater variability in the LG2 record over the last 4000 years.

115,"Individual contribution of insolation and CO2 to the interglacial climates of the past 800,000 years | The individual contributions of insolation and greenhouse gases (GHG) to the interglacial climates of the past 800,000 years are quantified through simulations with a model of intermediate complexity LOVECLIM and using the factor separation technique. The interglacials are compared in terms of their forcings and responses of surface air temperature, vegetation and sea ice. The results show that the relative magnitude of the simulated interglacials is in reasonable agreement with proxy data. GHG plays a dominant role on the variations of the annual mean temperature of both the Globe and the southern high latitudes, whereas, insolation plays a dominant role on the variations of tree fraction, precipitation and of the northern high latitude temperature and sea ice. The Mid-Brunhes Event (MBE) appears to be significant only in GHG and climate variables dominated by it. The results also show that the relative importance of GHG and insolation on the warmth intensity varies from one interglacial to another. For the warmest (MIS-9 and MIS-5) and coolest (MIS-17 and MIS-13) interglacials, GHG and insolation reinforce each other. MIS-11 (MIS-15) is a warm (cool) interglacial due to its high (low) GHG concentration, its insolation contributing to a cooling (warming). MIS-7, although with high GHG concentrations, can not be classified as a warm interglacial due to it large insolation-induced cooling. Related to these two forcings, MIS-19 appears to be the best analogue for MIS-1. In the response to insolation, the annual mean temperatures averaged over the globe and over southern high latitudes are highly linearly correlated with obliquity. However, precession becomes important in the temperature of the northern high latitudes and controls the tree fraction globally. Over the polar oceans, the response during the local winters, although the available energy is small, is larger than during the local summers due to the summer remnant effect. The sensitivity to double CO2 is the highest for the coolest interglacial. | ['berger', 'yin'] | ","['berger', 'yin']",1
116,"Initial Establishment of Saxicolous Lichens Following Recent Glacial Recession in Sverdrup Pass Ellesmere Island Canada | In the recently deglaciated zone of a valley glacier in Central Ellesmere Island the mean period of time before the onset of colonization on bare rock surfaces was estimated to be about 80 years. The first species to establish was Xanthoria elegans, followed by Lecanora crenulata and Umbilicaria viriginis approximately 20 years later. Summer temperature appeared to be one factor which affected lichen establishment in recently deglaciated bare areas in the High-Arctic. Warmer microsites were identified as preferrred locations for thallus establishment; these, therefore, constitute ideal sites for studies of thallus initiation under natural conditions. Following the retreat of a glacier from its most advance Little Ice Age position, 16 species of saxicolous lichens have become established on bare rock debris in the icefree zone, but in nine transects only five species had a constancy of 80% or more. Lichen diversity in this successional photocommunity was comparable to that in a nearby pre-Little Ice Age landscape with more varied substrata. | ['fahselt', 'maycock', 'svoboda'] | ","['fahselt', 'maycock', 'svoboda']",4
117,"Interglacial and Holocene temperature reconstructions based on midge remains in sediments of two lakes from Baffin Island, Nunavut, Arctic Canada | Midge remains (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae and Chaoboridae) from two upland lake basins on the Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island were analyzed and the results used in a transfer function to reconstruct paleotemperatures. This upland region remained ice-free throughout the last glacial cycle and the two lake basins retain sediments deposited during the previous interglacial period as well as during the Holocene period, but they did not accumulate sediment during most of the glacial period. Midge remains are abundant and well preserved at both sites. Midge-inferred summer surface water temperatures and mean July air temperatures were estimated using an inference model built on modem samples spanning a geographic range extending from Devon Island, Canada to Maine, USA. Data from twenty-nine new surface samples from Baffin Island were added to an existing inference model. The new weighted averaging (WA) model for summer surface water temperature yields r(jack)(2)=0.88 and RMSEP=2.22 degrees C for summer water temperatures, and r(jack)(2)=0.88 and RMSEP=1.53 degrees C for mean July air temperatures. Reconstructions at both sites indicate that summer temperatures during the last interglacial were higher than at any time in the Holocene, and 5 to 10 degrees C higher than present. Peak Holocene temperatures occurred in the first half of the period, and have decreased since about the mid-Holocene. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

118,"A model to interpret driftwood transport in the Arctic | Driftwood is frequently used to estimate past changes of sea ice extent and circulation in the Arctic. Nevertheless, driftwood observations are difficult to interpret because of the potentially complex relation with climate change. In order to determine the origin of the observed changes, we built a driftwood transport model (DTM) simulating the driftwood trajectories from the boreal forest to Arctic coasts. The model is driven by three main variables, which are the sea ice velocity, concentration and the sea surface current velocity that can be derived from observations or climate model outputs (e.g. from a General Climate Model - GCM). Overall, the DTM model agrees with the observations, although this comparison needs to be taken with caution because of the sparse data and the uncertainties of driftwood provenance. Through simulations performed with the DTM model, we confirm the strong influence of the variability of the atmospheric circulation on the spatial driftwood distribution. Model simulations of the Mid-Holocene period driven by six GCMs show that small local changes in sea ice circulation - a westward shift in the Transpolar Drift and a reduced Beaufort Gyre during the Mid-Holocene compared to the present period - suffice to explain the driftwood landing change during the Mid-Holocene, with a non-negligible contribution from reduced sea ice concentration. Consequently, a change in driftwood deposit should not be directly interpreted as large modifications in atmospheric circulation and the complexity of the response of driftwood trajectories to past climate changes clearly highlights the interest of using a model to interpret driftwood records.

119,"Isolation basin stratigraphy and Holocene relative sea-level change on Arveprinsen Ejland, Disko Bugt, West Greenland | This paper presents the results of an investigation into Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) change, isostatic rebound and ice sheet dynamics in Disko Bugt, West Greenland. Data collected from nine isolation basins on Arveprinsen Ejland, east Disko Bugt, show that mean sea level fell continuously from ca. 70 m at 9.9 ka cal. yr BP (8.9 ka 14 yr BP) to reach a minimum of ca. -5 m at 2.8 ka cal. yr BP (2.5 ka 14C yr BP), before rising to the present day. A west-east gradient in isostatic uplift across Disko Bugt is confirmed, with reduced rebound observed in east Disko Bugt. However, RSL differences (up to 20 m at 7.8 ka to 6.8 ka cal. yr BP (7 ka to 6 ka 14C yr BP)) also exist within east Disko Bugt, suggesting a significant north-south component to the area's isostatic history. The observed magnitude and timing of late Holocene RSL rise is not compatible with regional forebulge collapse. Instead, RSL rise began first in the eastern part of the bay, as might be expected under a scenario of crustal subsidence caused by neoglacial ice sheet readvance. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of isolation basin data for local and regional RSL studies in Greenland, and the importance of avoiding data compilations from areas where the isobase orientation is uncertain. | ['long', 'robert', 'wright'] | ","['long', 'robert', 'wright']",2
120,"Isolation and water-level fluctuations of Lake Kachishayoot, northern Quebec, Canada | This study combines different methods, including grain size, macrofossil, and pollen analyses, to reconstruct paleogeographical and paleoclimatological conditions for periods before, during, and after the isolation of a small lake (Lake Kachishayoot) in northern Quebec. After the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet around 8000 14C yr B.P., the area was submerged by the Tyrrell Sea. The transition from marine to lacustrine environment occurred about 5400 yr B.P. Two major periods of water-level fluctuations were inferred from organic and mineral sediments: a high water level that occurred after 3200 yr B.P. and a low water level that started before 2200 yr B.P. Our chronological data for the first period are consistent with those from nearby Lac des Pluviers and from other lakes in east central Canada and in the northeastern United States. During the low-water-level period, however, there is no evidence for minor fluctuations, whereas other lakes in northern Quebec and east-central Canada underwent several brief lowerings. Long-term changes in atmospheric circulation caused by changing global boundary conditions likely explained long-term water-level fluctuations of Lake Kachishayoot. | ['bhiry', 'lavoie', 'miousse'] | ","['bhiry', 'lavoie', 'miousse']",2
121,"Lacustrine evidence of early-Holocene environmental change in northern Iceland: a multiproxy palaeoecology and stable isotope study | Early-Holocene warming in Iceland caused rapid glacial ice melt which led to exposed landscapes on which soils developed and floras quickly established. Our chironomid-based records from northern Iceland suggest temperatures were up to 2-2.5 degrees C warmer than present throughout the first two millennia post deglaciation (similar to 10 500 to 8500 cal. BP) while sedimentary and isotopic data indicate the development of soils within the local environment throughout this period before catchment conditions started to stabilise around 8400 cal. BP. The warming trend over this period was not uniform however, but punctuated by a series of relatively short-lived climatic events. Specifically inwash events are suggested by the delta C-13(organic), %TOC and C/N data around 9600 cal. BP and 8250 cal. BP and are seen at two independent sites. There is also evidence from the delta O-18(carbonate) and delta C-13(carbonate) records which suggests that progressive evaporation of the study lakes occurred from similar to 8200 cal. BP, the timing of which accords well with other isotopic records of drier conditions from around the North Atlantic. | ['caseldine', 'holmes', 'langdon', 'leng'] | ","['caseldine', 'holmes', 'langdon', 'leng']",1

123,"Lake sediments with Azorean tephra reveal ice-free conditions on coastal northwest Spitsbergen during the Last Glacial Maximum | Lake sediments retrieved from the beds of former nonerosive ice sheets offer unique possibilities to constrain changes in the extent and style of past glaciation, and place them in an absolutely dated context. We present the first pre-Holocene lake sediments from Arctic Svalbard. Radiocarbon dating of terrestrial plant fossils reveals that the investigated catchment was unglaciated and vegetated between 30 and 20 ka B.P. during the global Last Glacial Maximum. The presence of volcanic ash from a contemporaneous Azorean eruption also provides evidence for ice-free conditions. Indicators of sediment compaction and a depositional hiatus suggest subsequent coverage by nonerosive ice until 11 ka B.P. Comparison with regional paleoclimate data indicates that sea ice variability controlled this pattern of ice sheet evolution by modulating moisture supply. Facing rapid regional sea ice losses, our findings have implications for the future response of the Arctic's cryosphere, a major driver of global sea-level rise.

Boreas, 10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00038.x. ISSN 0300-9483.A 2.9 m long sedimentary record was studied from a small lake, here referred to as Duck Lake, located at 76 degrees 25'N, 18 degrees 45'W on Store Koldewey, an elongated island off the coast of Northeast Greenland. The sediments were investigated for their geophysical and biogeochemical characteristics, and for their fossil chironomid assemblages. Organic matter began to accumulate in the lake at 9.1 cal. kyr BP, which provides a minimum age for the deglaciation of the basin. Although the early to mid-Holocene is known as a thermal maximum in East Greenland, organic matter accumulation in the lake remained low during the early Holocene, likely due to late plant immigration and lack of nutrient availability. Organic matter accumulation increased during the middle and late Holocene, when temperatures in East Greenland gradually decreased. Enhanced soil formation probably led to higher nutrient availability and increased production in the lake. Chironomids are abundant throughout the record after 9.1 cal. kyr BP and seem to react sensitively to changes in temperature and nutrient availability. It is concluded that relative temperature reconstructions based on biogeochemical data have to be regarded critically, particularly in the period shortly after deglaciation when nutrient availability was low. Chironomids may be a suitable tool for climatic reconstructions even in those high arctic environments. However, a better understanding of the ecology of chironomids under these extreme conditions is needed. | ['bennike', 'heiri', 'klug', 'melles', 'schmidt', 'wagner'] | ","['bennike', 'heiri', 'klug', 'melles', 'schmidt', 'wagner']",2
125,"Last Glacial Maximum environmental conditions at Andoya, northern Norway; evidence for a northern ice-edge ecological ""hotspot"" | Andoya on the NW coast of Norway is a key site for understanding the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in northern Europe. Controversy has arisen concerning the local conditions, especially about the timing and extent of local glacial cover, maximum July temperatures and whether pine and/or spruce could have grown there. We reviewed all existing data and add newly analysed ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA), pollen, macrofossils, geochemistry and stable isotopes from three lake sediment cores from Ovre AErasvatnet. A total of 23 new dates and age-depth modelling suggests the lake has been ice-free since GI2 (<23.4 cal ka BP) and possibly GS3 (<26.7 cal ka BP). Pinus and Picea sedaDNA was found in all three cores but at such low frequencies that it could not be distinguished from background contamination. LGM samples have an exceptionally high organic matter content, with isotopic values indicating that carbon and nitrogen derive from a marine source. Along with finds of bones of the little auk (Alle alle), this indicates that the lake received guano from an adjacent bird colony. SedaDNA, pollen and macrofossil assemblages were dominated by Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Papaver, but scattered occurrence of species currently restricted to the Low Arctic Tundra Zone (July temperature of 8-9 degrees C) such as Apiaceae (sedaDNA, 8-9 degrees C), and Alchemilla alpina (macrofossil, 8-9 degrees C) were also recorded. The review of >14.7 cal ka BP data recorded 94 vascular plant taxa, of which 38% have a northern limit in Shrub Tundra or more southern vegetation zones. This unusual assemblage likely stems from a combination of proximity to ice-free water in summer, geographical isolation linked with stochastic long-distance dispersal events, and the presence of bird-fertilized habitats. The environmental reconstruction based on all records from the area does not preclude local growth of tree species, as the local climate combined with high nutrient input may have led to periodically suitable environmental 'hotspot' conditions.

126,"The Last Glacial Maximum on Spitsbergen Svalbard | Most scientists have concluded previously that the west coast of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, remained ice-free during the late Weichselian, between 25,000 and 10,000 yr B.P. We conclude that the glaciation was more extensive. Terraces that were postulated to have been ice-free are covered by a thin, late Weichselian till. Sudden drop in the marine limit and basal radiocarbon dates of raised glaciomarine sediments demonstrates that the glaciers in the main fjords, Isfjorden and Van Mijenfjorden, terminated west (outside) of the fjord mouths. Basal radiocarbon dates from glaciomarine clay above till in cores from the continental shelf west of Spitsbergen yielded ages of about 12,500 yr B.P., from which we conclude that the ice extended to the shelf edge. Based on the extent of amino acid diagenesis in radiocarbon-dated molluscs, the duration of the maximum extension of the late Weichselian glaciation was short, certainly less than 10,000 years. During the ice-free period preceding that glaciation, at least back to 40,000 yr B.P., the glaciers on Svalbard were not significantly larger than at present, as shown by marine deposits close to the glacier snouts. Many radiocarbon dates place deglaciation of the outer coast at about 12,500 yr B.P. At about 10,000 yr B.P., the rest of the archipelago rapidly became ice-free. | ['bolstad', 'elgersma', 'helliksen', 'landvik', 'lonne', 'lycke', 'mangerud', 'salvigsen', 'sandahl', 'svendsen'] | ","['bolstad', 'elgersma', 'helliksen', 'landvik', 'lonne', 'lycke', 'mangerud', 'salvigsen', 'sandahl', 'svendsen']",4

128,"Late Holocene climate and environmental changes in Kamchatka inferred from the subfossil chironomid record | This study presents a reconstruction of the Late Holocene climate in Kamchatka based on chironomid remains from a 332 cm long composite sediment core recovered from Dvuyurtochnoe Lake (Two-Yurts Lake, TYL) in central Kamchatka. The oldest recovered sediments date to about 4500 cal years BP. Chironomid head capsules from TYL reflect a rich and diverse fauna. An unknown morphotype of Tanytarsini, Tanytarsus type klein, was found in the lake sediments. Our analysis reveals four chironomid assemblage zones reflecting four different climatic periods in the Late Holocene. Between 4500 and 4000 cal years BP, the chironomid composition indicates a high lake level, well-oxygenated lake water conditions and close to modern temperatures ([approximately] 13 [degree]C). From 4000 to 1000 cal years BP, two consecutive warm intervals were recorded, with the highest reconstructed temperature reaching 16.8 [degree]C between 3700 and 2800 cal years BP. Cooling trend, started around 1100 cal years BP led to low temperatures during the last stage of the Holocene. Comparison with other regional studies has shown that termination of cooling at the beginning of late Holocene is relatively synchronous in central Kamchatka, South Kurile, Bering and Japanese Islands and take place around 3700 cal years BP. From ca 3700 cal years BP to the last millennium, a newly strengthened climate continentality accompanied by general warming trend with minor cool excursions led to apparent spatial heterogeneity of climatic patterns in the region. Some timing differences in climatic changes reconstructed from chironomid record of TYL sediments and late Holocene events reconstructed from other sites and other proxies might be linked to differences in local forcing mechanisms or caused by the different degree of dating precision, the different temporal resolution, and the different sensitive responses of climate proxies to the climate variations. Further high-resolution stratigraphic studies in this region are needed to understand the spatially complex pattern of climate change in Holocene in Kamchatka and the surrounding region.

129,"Late Holocene climatic variability in Subarctic Canada: Insights from a high-resolution lake record from the central Northwest Territories | We examined late Holocene (ca. 3300 yr BP to present-day) climate variability in the central Northwest Territories (Canadian Subarctic) using a diatom and sedimentological record from Danny's Lake (63.48 degrees N, 112.54 degrees W), located 40 km southwest of the modern-day tree-line. High-resolution sampling paired with a robust age model (25 radiocarbon dates) allowed for the examination of both lake hydroecological conditions (30-year intervals; diatoms) and sedimentological changes in the watershed (12-year intervals; grain size records) over the late Holocene. Time series analysis of key lake ecological indicators (diatom species Aulacoseira alpigena, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata and Achnanthidium minutissimum) and sedimentological parameters, reflective of catchment processes (coarse silt fraction), suggests significant intermittent variations in turbidity, pH and light penetration within the lake basin. In the diatom record, we observed discontinuous periodicities in the range of ca. 69, 88-100, 115-132, 141-188, 562, 750 and 900 years (>90% and >95% confidence intervals), whereas the coarse silt fraction was characterized by periodicities in the >901 and <61-year range (>95% confidence interval). Periodicities in the proxy data from the Danny's Lake sediment core align with changes in total solar irradiance over the past ca. 3300 yr BP and we hypothesize a link to the Suess Cycle, Gleissberg Cycle and Pacific Decadal Oscillation via occasional inland propagation of shifting air masses over the Pacific Ocean.

130,"Late Holocene diatom biostratigraphy and sea-level changes in the southeastern Beaufort Sea | Late Holocene sediments from the Atkinson Point area were analysed to provide quantitative reconstructions of recent sea-level changes in the southeastern Beaufort Sea. The succession of diatom assemblages in five cores revealed paleoenvironmental changes induced by the transgression of the Beaufort Sea during successive periods of lacustrine conditions, breaching and flooding of thermokarst lakes by the sea, and the landward migration of sandy spits. Based on radiocarbon dates and quantitative paleodepth determinations, a relative sea-level curve for the late Holocene has been developed. Despite a loss of temporal precision due to old carbon contamination, an envelope of sea-level change has been defined for the last 2 ka BP, suggesting a sea-level rise in the order of 1.1 mm a(-1) for the last millennium.

131,"Late Holocene environmental changes inferred from diatoms in a lake on the western Taimyr Peninsula, northern Russia | Changes in the diatom assemblages preserved in a sediment core taken from a small lake located north of arctic treeline on the western Taimyr Peninsula, Russia, were examined in order to investigate late Holocene (i.e., ca 5000 cal yr BP to present) climatic and environmental changes within the region. Early diatom assemblages were dominated by benthic Fragilaria taxa and indicate a transitional phase in the lake history, most likely reflecting lake development and environmental change associated with treeline retreat to the south of the study site. Concurrent with pollen and macrofossil evidence of a vegetation shift to shrub tundra in the catchment basin at ca 4200 cal yr BP, an increase in cold-water taxa, followed by little change in diatom assemblages until ca 2800 cal yr BP, suggests that conditions were relatively cool and stable at this time. The last apprx2000 years of the Middendorf Lake record have been marked by fluctuating limnological conditions, characterized by striking successional shifts between Fragilaria pinnata and Aulacoseira distans var. humilis. Recent conditions in Middendorf Lake indicate an increase in diatom taxa previously rare in the record, possibly associated with twentieth-century climatic warming. The Middendorf Lake record indicates that significant limnological change may occur in the absence of catchment vegetation shifts, suggesting late-Holocene decoupling of aquatic and terrestrial responses to climatic and hydrological change. Our study results represent one of the few paleoecological records currently available from northern Russia, and highlight the need for further development of calibration data sets from this region. | ['laing', 'smol'] | ","['laing', 'smol']",1
132,"Late Holocene expansion of Istorvet ice cap, Liverpool Land, east Greenland | The Greenland Ice Sheet is undergoing dynamic changes that will have global implications if they continue into the future. In this regard, an understanding of how the ice sheet responded to past climate changes affords a baseline for anticipating future behavior. Small, independent ice caps adjacent to the Greenland Ice Sheet (hereinafter called ""local ice caps"") are sensitive indicators of the response of Greenland ice-marginal zones to climate change. Therefore, we reconstructed late Holocene ice-marginal fluctuations of the local Istorvet ice cap in east Greenland, using radiocarbon dates of subfossil plants, Be-10 dates of surface boulders, and analyses of sediment cores from both threshold and control lakes. During the last termination, the Istorvet ice cap had retreated close to its maximum Holocene position by similar to 11,730 cal yr BP. Radiocarbon dates of subfossil plants exposed by recent recession of the ice margin indicate that the Istorvet cap was smaller than at present from AD 200 to AD 1025. Sediments from a threshold lake show no glacial input until the ice cap advanced to within 365 m of its Holocene maximum position by AD similar to 1150. Thereafter the ice cap remained at or close to this position until at least AD 1660. The timing of this, the most extensive of the Holocene, expansion is similar to that recorded at some glaciers in the Alps and in southern Alaska. However, in contrast to these other regions, the expansion in east Greenland at AD 1150 appears to have been very close to, if not at, a maximum Holocene value. Comparison of the Istorvet ice-cap fluctuations with Holocene glacier extents in Southern Hemisphere middle-to-high latitude locations on the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Andes and the Southern Alps suggests an out-of-phase relationship. If correct, this pattern supports the hypothesis that a bipolar see-saw of oceanic and/or atmospheric circulation during the Holocene produced asynchronous glacier response at some localities in the two polar hemispheres.

Correlation between cores was successfully based on a chronology constructed from AMS C-14 dating of pollen concentrates. Comparison to other radiocarbon-dated pollen sequences from the Baikal region suggests that the chronology presented is very reliable, and thus correlation to other dated events can easily be performed. Pollen indices, which reflect relative changes in major vegetation types and limitations of growing conditions by moisture availability and temperature, demonstrate near-synchronous vegetation changes, which suggest synchronous large-scale climate variation across the Baikal region. Due to the limited influence of human impact in the Lake Baikal region, the pollen data illustrate that, in the continental interior of NE Eurasia Holocene, climate variability was very pronounced. After initial warming and a strong increase in relative moisture (ca. 16 cal ka BP), the Bolling-Allerod-like event was punctuated by three cool and dry events. These events, dated between ca. 15 and 13 cal ka BP, can be compared to coolings as recorded in GISP 2 oxygen isotope records from Greenland ice cores. An expansion of Betula sect. Nanael Fruticosae, Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae marks the Younger-Dryas (YD)-like cooling event (ca. 12.5-12 cal ka BP). High temperatures and favourable moisture conditions during the first part of Holocene favoured the optimum development of dark coniferous taiga between 11-7.5 cal ka BP in the south and 10-8 cal ka BP in the northeast. A fir and spruce decline in the southern mountains (ca. 9.5-8.5 cal ka BP) can be related to the 8.2 cal ka BP cooling event. The pronounced mid-Holocene cooling event and a transition towards dry conditions (ca. 8-7 cal ka BP) preceded the nearly synchronous regional expansion of pine taiga. Maximum distribution of Scots pine forests marks the Holocene thermal optimum (ca. 6.5-5.7 cal ka BP), which was followed by two subsequent cooling events (ca. 5.5-4.5 cal ka BP) at the Atlantic-Subboreal transition. A subsequent temperature optimum in the southeastern Baikal region ended with pronounced cooling during the Subboreal-Subatlantic transition (ca. 3-2.5 cal ka BP). A late spread of shrub alders may evidence the beginning of the Little Ice Age. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

134,"Late-Holocene land surface change in a coupled social-ecological system, southern Iceland: a cross-scale tephrochronology approach | The chronological challenge of cross-scale analysis within coupled socio-ecological systems can be met with tephrochronology based on numerous well-dated tephra layers. We illustrate this with an enhanced chronology from Skaftartunga, south Iceland that is based on 200 stratigraphic profiles and 2635 individual tephra deposits from 23 different eruptions within the last 1140 years. We present new sediment-accumulation rate based dating of tephra layers from Grimsvotn in AD 1432 +/- 5 and AD 1457 +/- 5. These and other tephras underpin an analysis of land surface stability across multiple scales. The aggregate regional sediment accumulation records suggest a relatively slow rate of land surface change which can be explained by climate and land use change over the period of human occupation of the island (after AD similar to 870), but the spatial patterning of change shows that it is more complex, with landscape scale hysteresis and path dependency making the relationship between climate and land surface instability contingent. An alternative steady state of much higher rates of sediment accumulation is seen in areas below 300 m asl after AD 870 despite large variations in climate, with two phases of increased erosion, one related to vegetation change (AD 870-1206) and another related to climate (AD 1597-1918). In areas above 300 m asl there is a short lived increase in erosion and related deposition after settlement (AD similar to 870-935) and then relatively little additional change to present. Spatial correlation between rates of sediment accumulation at different profiles decreases rapidly after AD similar to 935 from similar to 4 km to less than 250 m as the landscape becomes more heterogeneous. These new insights are only possible using high-resolution tephrochronology applied spatially across a landscape, an approach that can be applied to the large areas of the Earth's surface affected by the repeated fallout of cm-scale tephra layers.

135,"Late-Holocene paleoenvironments of northwest Iceland from lake sediments | Frozen sediment cores from two lakes in northwest Iceland, Vatnsdalsvatn and Thioriksvallavatn, provide a nearly 1000-year, decadal-scale record of past environmental changes, based on environmental magnetism, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy geochemistry, carbon content, and C/N analyses. Accelerator mass spectrometry 14C and 210Pb results provide chronologies for both sites, covering the late 20th century to 960 BP at Vatnsdalsvatn and to 480 BP at Thioriksvallavatn. These analyses reveal higher levels of sedimentary carbon during the Little Ice Age, between 600 and 50 BP, at Vatnsdalsvatn. C/N analyses suggest that some of this carbon enrichment came from terrestrial plants. Higher erosion rates during the Little Ice Age may also have increased the influx of limiting nutrients, enhancing algal productivity. Erosion is the dominant mechanism for sedimentary changes at both sites and seems to occur at predictable intervals. Geochemical indicators of erosion oscillate with a distinct 80-100 yr periodicity for nine centuries at Vatnsdalsvatn and for four centuries at Thioriksvallavatn. These erosion cycles are consistent with long-term stability in the positive mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation but may also be attributed to local climatic effects associated with Great Salinity Anomalies. | ['doner'] | ",['doner'],1
136,"Late Pleistocene of Europe | Qualitative and quantitative late Pleistocene climate reconstructions based on chironomid assemblages are reviewed. Several qualitative records are available which provide useful insights into late-glacial climate dynamics. At present, high-resolution, low-error, chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature reconstructions are available from only four sites in Europe (one each from Norway, Scotland, England, and France) but each provides quantitative climate reconstructions that are comparable in the level of detail with oxygen isotope records. The trends and temperature estimates of the chironomid-inferred reconstructions are largely corroborated by results derived from other biological and nonbiological proxies, although more records are needed if the reasons for inconsistencies between records are to be understood and resolved. Consistent differences between the trends in the oxygen isotope Greenland ice core (GRIP) records and oxygen isotope records from England and southern Germany are also reflected in the chironomid-derived records which more closely resemble local isotope records. This highlights the regional differences in climate across Europe during the Late Glacial and underlines that it should not be assumed that the GRIP record equates to European climate in general. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Late Quaternary environmental history of the area has been studied extensively during the last decades. However, Late Pleistocene and Holocene history of Lake Taymyr itself remain uncertain. More information concerning lake-level changes and climate conditions can be obtained by studying lake terraces. During summer 2016, several outcrops of Lake Taymyr terraces (10-m high and 25-m high terraces) deposits have been investigated.

138,"Late Pleistocene to Holocene vegetation and climate changes in northwestern Chukotka (Far East Russia) deduced from lakes Ilirney and Rauchuagytgyn pollen records | This paper presents two new pollen records and quantitative climate reconstructions from northern Chukotka documenting environmental changes over the last 27.9 ka. Open tundra- and steppe-like habitats dominated between 27.9 and 18.7 cal. ka BP. Betula and Alnus shrubs might have grown in sheltered microhabitats but disappeared after 18.7 cal. ka BP. Although the climate was rather harsh, local herb-dominated communities supported herbivores as is evident by the presence of coprophilous spores in the sediments. The increase in Salix and Cyperaceae similar to 16.1 cal. ka BP suggests climate amelioration. Shrub Betula appeared similar to 15.9 cal. ka BP, and became dominant after similar to 15.52 cal. ka BP, whilst typical steppe communities drastically reduced. Very high presence of Botryococcus in the Lateglacial sediments reflects widespread shallow habitats, probably due to lake level increase. Shrub Alnus became common after similar to 13 cal. ka BP reflecting further climate amelioration. Simultaneously, herb communities gradually decreased in the vegetation reaching a minimum similar to 11.8 cal. ka BP. A gradual decrease of algae remains suggests a reduction of shallow-water habitats. Shrubby and graminoid tundra was dominant similar to 11.8-11.1 cal. ka BP, later Salix stands significantly decreased. The forest-tundra ecotone established in the Early Holocene, shortly after 11.1 cal. ka BP. Low contents of green algae in the Early Holocene sediments likely reflect deeper aquatic conditions. The most favourable climate conditions were between similar to 10.6 and 7 cal. ka BP. Vegetation became similar to the modern after similar to 7 cal. ka BP but Pinus pumila came to the Ilirney area at about 1.2 cal. ka BP. It is important to emphasize that the study area provided refugia for Betula and Alnus during MIS 2. It is also notable that our records do not reflect evidence of Younger Dryas cooling, which is inconsistent with some regional environmental records but in good accordance with some others. | ['andreev', 'biskaborn', 'bohmer', 'courtin', 'herzschuh', 'kruse', 'pestryakova', 'raschke', 'stoof', 'leichsenring', 'vyse'] | ","['andreev', 'biskaborn', 'bohmer', 'courtin', 'herzschuh', 'kruse', 'pestryakova', 'raschke', 'stoof', 'leichsenring', 'vyse']",2

Open larch forest with Alnus fruticosa and Betula nana grew during the Kargin (Middle Weichselian) Interstade, ca. 48,000-25,000 14C yr B.P. The climate was generally warmer and wetter than today.

The statistical information method used for climate reconstruction shows that the coldest climate was ca. 20,000-17,000 14C yr B.P. A warming (Allerod Interstade?) with mean July temperature ca. 1.5degreeC warmer than today occurred ca. 12,000 14C yr B.P.

140,"Late Pleistocene/Holocene Radiolarian and Pollen Records from Sediments in the Sea of Okhotsk | In two cores with oxygen isotope stratigraphy from the southern Okhotsk Sea, marine pollen and siliceous microfauna record concurrent late glacial through Holocene variations in regional terrestrial and marine environments. Glacial vegetation around the southern Okhotsk basin, which resembles the present tundra/steppe of the northwest coast of this marginal sea, yields to spruce-dominated boreal forests during the glacial/interglacial transition. Temperate forest components, such as oak, peak during the mid-Holocene. Decreasing oak accompanied by increasing spruce reflects the effect of global cooling on local vegetation during the last 4 kyr. Although the radiolarian fauna in the Okhotsk Sea samples is similar to that present in the northwest Pacific, the dominant species in both regions differ. Concentrations of radiolarians are low in latest glacial samples, with higher concentrations occurring above and below this interval. Cycladophora davisiana, the dominant radiolarian species in the majority of Holocene Okhotsk Sea sediments, is present at lower percentages in late glacial samples from our two sites. Thus, this species' Holocene/latest Pleistocene abundance pattern in Sea of Okhotsk sediments is the reverse of that recorded in high-latitude open ocean sites. The combined marine pollen and radiolarian records indicate changes in the Sea of Okhotsk's physical oceanographic conditions and surrounding vegetation during the late glacial which were associated with this region's response to global climate change. | ['heusser', 'morley', 'shackleton'] | ","['heusser', 'morley', 'shackleton']",4
141,"Late Holocene precipitation and temperature changes in Northern Europe linked with North Atlantic forcing | Long-term paleoclimatic records are needed for understanding natural variability in the context of climate change. Two lake sediment cores were collected from eastern Finland from sites considered sensitive for precipitation and temperature, respectively, over the last similar to 3000 yr. The paleoclimatic reconstructions based on fossil Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) assemblages were considered against a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) reconstruction to disentangle possible forcing mechanisms. Generally low effective precipitation was reconstructed between similar to 3000 and 1500 cal yr BP (calibrated years before present). A distinct stream flow event occurred between similar to 2400 and 2200 cal yr BP, and the highest effective precipitation occurred similar to 1300 cal yr BP. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between similar to 1200 and 800 cal yr BP was dry, but the Little Ice Age (LIA) between similar to 700 and 200 cal yr BP had fluctuating precipitation. The temperature reconstruction depicted a late Holocene cooling trend, which ended at similar to 1300 cal yr BP when the warm MCA began. The MCA was followed by the cold LIA and the last 100 yr have been characterized by rapid warming. Present temperatures are higher than during any time period of the late Holocene. A general trend of positive NAO mode with elevated summer temperatures and dry hydroclimatic conditions prevailed during the MCA and a negative mode with reduced temperatures during the LIA. However, the NAO-hydroclimate relationship over eastern Scandinavia was not straightforward during the LIA, which varied in moisture dynamics.

142,"Late-Quaternary climatic change on the American North Pacific Coast | Temporal changes in solar radiation caused by variations in the Earth's orbit figure prominently in current Quaternary climate theory1-4. Experimental design of atmospheric circulation models emphasizes the importance of solar radiation in the heating of interglacial land and ocean surfaces at different seasons of the year, whereby monsoon-type circulation-seasonal shifting of regional cyclonic and anticyclonic centres-develops, while during glacial ages, seasonality is greatly modified by the influence of ice sheets5-7. We investigated the late-Quaternary climate of the North Pacific, where according to modelling, solar radiation in the early Holocene at the time of the summer solstice is high and in the late Holocene is relatively low. We compared quantitative temperature and precipitation estimates from southern Alaska, obtained by application of transfer functions to fossil pollen records, with estimates from western Washington8 and southern British Columbia9. Data extending over &gt; 10,000 years show a broadly consistent pattern of climatic change in general agreement with predicted variations in solar radiation and their effect on atmospheric circulation and seasonal duration of pressure systems over the North Pacific Ocean. In the early Holocene, as monsoon-type circulation became established with melting of glaciers, the subtropical North Pacific anticyclone annually regulated climate for a longer period at higher latitudes than at present, so that warmth and dryness (high summer radiation) increased in southern Alaska. The Aleutian low-pressure centre, locus of cyclonic storm activity, intensified during the late Holocene, resulting in colder and more humid coastal climate (low summer radiation) over much of the year and increased frequency of glacier growth in the cordillera. ¬© 1985 Nature Publishing Group. | ['heusser', 'heusser', 'peteet'] | ","['heusser', 'heusser', 'peteet']",3
143,"Late quaternary environmental and cultural changes in the Wollaston Forland region, Northeast Greenland | This chapter provides a review of proxy data from a variety of natural archives sampled in the Wollaston Forland region, central Northeast Greenland. The data are used to describe long-term environmental and climatic changes. The focus is on reconstructing the Holocene conditions particularly in the Zackenberg area. In addition, this chapter provides an overview of the archaeological evidence for prehistoric occupation of the region. The Zackenberg area has been covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet several times during the Quaternary. At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, about 22,000 years BP), temperatures were much lower than at present, and only very hardy organisms may have survived in the region, even if ice-free areas existed. Marked warming at around 11,700 years BP led to ice recession, and the Zackenberg area was deglaciated in the early Holocene, prior to 10,100 years BP. Rapid early Holocene land emergence was replaced by a slight transgression in the late Holocene. During the Holocene, summer solar insolation decreased in the north. Following deglaciation of the region, summer temperatures probably peaked in the early to mid-Holocene, as indicated by the occurrence of a southern beetle species. However, the timing for the onset of the Holocene thermal maximum is rather poorly constrained because of delayed immigration of key plant species. During the thermal maximum, the mean July temperature was at least 2-3 degrees C higher than at present. Evidence for declining summer temperatures is seen at around 5500, 4500 and 3500 years BP. The cooling culminated during the Little Ice Age that peaked about 100-200 years ago. The first plants that immigrated to the region were herbs and mosses. The first dwarf shrubs arrived in Northeast Greenland prior to 10,400 years BP, and dwarf birch arrived around 8800 years BP. The first people arrived about 4500 years BP, but the region was depopulated several times before the last people disappeared some time after 1823 AD, perhaps as a consequence of poor hunting conditions during the peak of the Little Ice Age. | ['amsinck', 'andreasen', 'bennike', 'bocher', 'christiansen', 'fredskild', 'humlum', 'jacobsen', 'jeppesen', 'sorensen'] | ","['amsinck', 'andreasen', 'bennike', 'bocher', 'christiansen', 'fredskild', 'humlum', 'jacobsen', 'jeppesen', 'sorensen']",0
144,"The Late Quaternary Geomorphic and Paleoclimatic History of the Cape Dyer Area Easternmost Baffin Island Northwest Territories Canada | The Cape Dyer area of easternmost Baffin Island was isolated from the Laurentide Ice Sheet by the fiords of Cumberland Peninsula. Accordingly, the glacial chronology at Cape Dyer is that of local ice only and is indicative of the local climate throughout the late Quaternary. Six drift units, representing three periods of restricted glaciation and three of expanded glaciation, are present. Beyond the most distal drift is an area that has not been modified by glaciation. The expanded glaciations were dated through correlation on the bases of moraine morphology, soil development, and amino-acid racemization in marine mollusc shells incorporated in the drifts. No maximum age can be assigned to the earliest glaciation in the Cape Dyer area, but the last major glacial advance occurred about 70 000 years BP. The presence of extensive glaciofluvial features, faunal indicators of warm ocean water, and rapid soil development indicate that major glaciations of the Cape Dyer area accompanied winters warmer than at present but summers sufficiently cool to allow ice advance. The restricted ice advances were dated through correlation on the basis of moraine morphology, soil development, and lichen cover to the period betweeen 9000 years BP and the present. They indicate ice extent similar to or less than at present throughout the past 60 000 years, in response to climatic conditions that were colder and dryer than the present until 9000 years BP, then slightly warmer than the present. Correlation with indicators of hemispheric and global climate indicates both in-phase and out-of-phase relationships.

Till fabrics indicate ice movements controlled by the local topography, while glaciotectonic deformations suggest that ice moved from an ice divide northeast of Kongsoya, independent of the local topography.

146,"Late Quaternary and Modern Evolution of Permafrost Coasts at Beliy Island, Kara Sea | The low coasts of Beliy Island, Kara Sea, composed of perennially frozen sands and silts with peat are extremely vulnerable to all changes in sea level and climate conditions in the Arctic. The complex Holocene history of the island is reflected in sediments outcropping in its coastal bluffs. Modern erosion leads to destruction of these bluffs, continuing to change the topography of the island.To reconstruct Late Quaternary history, coastal exposures were investigated. They generally consist of three units: the lower clays and sands with plant debris, parallel and rippled lamination formed in shallow marine conditions in MIS 3. The middle sandy unit with allochtonuous peat lenses was deposited in the mid-Holocene (5 to 8 ka BP) in coastal conditions. The upper peats, sandy loams and silts accumulated in continental conditions after 5 ka.To estimate modern coastal erosion rates, multitemporal satellite imagery (1969-2016) was used. The western coast retreated at higher average rates than the eastern coast (1.9 +/- 0.2 m/y and 1.2 +/- 0.2 m/y, respectively). Extreme rates during 47 years were higher from the eastern side (4.6 m/y compared to 3.1 m/y in the west). Both mean and extreme erosion rates are higher than the known erosion intensity of the Kara Sea coastal dynamics monitoring sites, evidencing considerable vulnerability of the low coasts to erosion in the changing climate. Evolution of the hydrometeorological parameters affecting coastal erosion in the XX-XXI century was estimated. High average retreat rates must have happened in the 2000s-2010s as a result of both temperature and wave energy increase providing unprecedent environmental forcing of coastal dynamics. | ['baranskaya', 'novikova', 'ogorodov', 'romanenko', 'shabanova'] | ","['baranskaya', 'novikova', 'ogorodov', 'romanenko', 'shabanova']",1

To quantitatively reconstruct summer temperatures, we analyzed lake sediments for fossil chironomids, and additionally we analyzed the sediments for fossil pollen and organic carbon content. A comparison with the delta O-18 record from Greenland indicates that the general climatic development of the region throughout the last glaciation-Holocene transition differed from that of the North Atlantic region. Between similar to 17 and 15 ka, mean July air temperature was on average 5 degrees C colder than modern, albeit a period of near-modern temperature at similar to 16.5 ka. Total pollen accumulation rates ranged between similar to 180 and 1200 grains cm(-2) yr(-1). At similar to 15 ka, approximately coeval with the Bolling interstadial, temperatures again reached modern values. At similar to 14 ka, nearly 1000 yr after warming began, Betula pollen percentages increased substantially and mark the transition to shrub-dominated pollen contributors.

We suggest that the influence of precipitation may be one of the factors causing discrepancies between chironomid-based late-Holocene July temperature (JulyT) reconstructions from Fennoscandia. We combine quantitative temperature reconstruction using chironomids for the last 5100 years with qualitative analysis of chironomid composition and geochemical analyses, such as x-ray fluorescence (XRF), total organic carbon (TOC) and C/N analysis. The studied sequence is dated by Pb-210, Cs-137 and 11 C-14 datings from terrestrial macrofossils. The aim of the study was to use chironomids to reconstruct late-Holocene summer temperature variation on a multi-centennial to centennial timescale and to use geochemical data to identify periods during which the changes in chironomid composition might have been forced by environmental variables other than temperature, such as within lake processes or precipitation. Based on ordination techniques, and a comparison between chironomid-inferred JulyTs and changes in minerogenic sedimentation with regional temperature and wetness records, it is concluded that the JulyT signal was modulated by precipitation. The proxies indicate that both JulyT and annual precipitation have influenced the chironomid communities in Lake Vuoksjavratje, and that catchment-related processes caused by enhanced precipitation have overridden the summer temperature signal between 3000 and 2200 cal. yr BP, and between 1050 and 100 cal. yr BP. | ['berntsson', 'rosqvist', 'velle'] | ","['berntsson', 'rosqvist', 'velle']",1

Following ice retreat and regression of relative sea level at the end of the Younger Dryas, the ice sheet advanced again and reached a spatial extent close to its Younger Dryas maximum at about 9.8 ka BP. Subsequently, the ice sheet retreated rapidly and at about 9.4 ka BP relative sea level fell towards and eventually below present sea level. Relative sea level had regressed to about 40 in below present sea level at about 8.9 ka BE when the rate of isostatic rebound was slowing down and eustatic sea level rise caused the onset of a transgression. At about 8.0 ka BP Icelandic glaciers were of a similar or a little lesser extent than at present, and during the mid-Holocene thermal optimum some of the present-day ice caps may have been significantly, reduced or absent. The onset of Neoglaciation occurred after 6-5 k-a BP and most Icelandic glaciers reached their Holocene maximum during the Little Ice Age. The vegetation history of Iceland reflects the glacial history in that the earliest evidence of plant succession is from mid Allerod times as grass and dwarf shrub tundra developed in the wake of the initial ice retreat. The younger Dryas cooling is evident in the biostratigraphical record as discontinuous vegetation cover and tundra environments developed. At the beginning of the Holocene, dwarf shrub, and later on, shrub heath with Salix, Dwarf birch, and Juniperus became established. Birch woodland, the climax vegetation during the Holocene, most probably had its greatest extent during the Atlantic Chronozone, at about 7-6 ka BP The woodland showed a retrogressive succession towards more open landscape during the second half of the Holocene as widespread mires, dwarf shrub heaths and grassland took over in the landscape evolution. The Norse settlement of Iceland in the 9th Century AD caused rapid vegetation changes in the wake of the settlement, where primarily intensive grazing caused woodland destruction and expansion of grass heath, dwarf shrub heath and mires. | ['hallsdottir', 'ingolfsson', 'norodahl', 'petursson'] | ","['hallsdottir', 'ingolfsson', 'norodahl', 'petursson']",2
152,"Late Weichselian (Valdaian) and Holocene vegetation and environmental history of the northern Timan Ridge, European Arctic Russia | Lake and peat deposits from the Timan Ridge, Arctic Russia, were pollen analysed, reconstructing the vegetation history and paleoenvironment since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 20-18,000 years ago. The sites studied are located inside the margins of a large paleolake of about 20 km(2), by us named Lake Timan. This lake developed in the Late Weichselian, more than 30,000 years after the deglaciation of this region, and was formed due to increased precipitation and warmer summers that accelerated the melting of stagnant ice within its catchment. The lake was drained during the early Holocene when the outlet rivers eroded the spillways. A new generation of much smaller lakes formed during the Holocene when the last remnants of buried glacier ice melted away causing the exposed floor of Lake Timan to subside. Since deglaciation, the following regional vegetation development has been recorded: (1) During the initial stage of Lake Timan, the dominant vegetation was discontinuous steppe/tundra, with patches of snow bed vegetation. (2) A dwarf-shrub tundra established during the Late Weichselian interstadial (Allerod), probably reflecting warmer and moister conditions. (3) The Younger Dryas cooling is recognised by a reversal to steppe/tundra and snowbeds on unstable mineral-soils, and higher palynological richness. (4) Soon after the transition into the Holocene, a birch-forest established on the Timan Ridge. (5) A cooling starting around 8200 cal. years BP initiated the deforestation of the exposed hills. In the most protected sites, birch trees persisted until later than 4000 years ago, reflecting a gradual development into the present treeless dwarf-shrub tundra. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

153,"Late wisconsinan buildup and wastage of the innuitian Ice Sheet across southern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut | During the Late Wisconsinan, a precursor of the Prince of Wales Icefield, southern Ellesmere Island, formed a prodigious ice divide of the Innuitian Ice Sheet. Initial buildup occurred after 19 ka BP, when the icefield advanced west (inland) across Makinson Inlet from margins similar to present. Subsequent reversal of flow to the east required ice divide migration to the west onto a plateau that is largely ice-free today. From this divide, a trunk glacier flowed eastward through Makinson Inlet to join the Smith Sound Ice Stream en route to nothern Baffin Bay. Westward flow from this divide filled Baumann Fiord, depositing a granite dispersal train that extends a further 600 km across the archipelago to the polar continental shelf. Deglaciation of most of Makinson Inlet occurred catastrophically at similar to9.3 ka BP, forming a calving bay that thinned the Innuitian divide, thereby triggering deglaciation of most of Baumann Fiord by 8.5 ka BP. Ninety C-14 dates on Holocene shells and driftwood constrain deglacial isochrones and postglacial emergence curves on opposite sides of the former Innuitian divide. Isobases drawn on the 8 ka BP shoreline rise northwest towards Eureka Sound, the axis of maximum former ice thickness. Ice margins on Ellesmere Island were similar to present from similar to50-19 ka BP (spanning marine isotope stages 3 and 2). However, significant regional variation in ice extent during this interval is recorded by ice rafting from the Laurentide Ice Sheet into Baffin Bay. Later buildup of the Innuitian Ice Sheet occurred during the low global sea level that defines the last glacial maximum (18 ka BP). We also suggest that the Innuitian Ice Sheet was influenced by the buttressing and subsequent removal of the Greenland Ice Sheet along eastern Ellesmere Island. | ['atkinson', 'dyke', 'england', 'evans', 'zreda'] | ","['atkinson', 'dyke', 'england', 'evans', 'zreda']",2
154,"Lateglacial and Holocene paleoenvironmental changes recorded in lake sediments, Brock Plateau (Melville Hills), Northwest Territories, Canada | Sediments from South Lake, Brock Plateau (Melville Hills), Northwest Territories, provide one of the longest postglacial records from the mainland western Canadian Arctic, outside of eastern Beringia. Sedimentation commenced at least 13 900 cal. yr BP, and possibly as early as 16 000 cal. yr BP, in response to early deglaciation of the site. Pollen is present throughout the record, with an initial Artemisia-Salix assemblage indicative of very cold conditions, consistent with a locally severe Younger Dryas Stade or simply continued proximity of the Laurentide Ice Sheet margin (c. 12 700 to 11 500 cal. yr BP). At c. 11 000 cal. yr BP, abiotic proxies signal a transition to warmer conditions, corroborated by a pollen assemblage dominated by Betula and Cyperaceae. Although South Lake was biologically productive during the early Holocene (c. 11 000 to 7000 cal. yr BP), diatoms and other siliceous organisms are notably absent from the record, suggesting severe silica limitation. Rises in Alnus crispa and Picea mariana pollen at c. 7000 cal. yr BP suggest cooling and/or an increase in effective moisture. Wetter conditions and increased hydrological inputs and silica supply likely led to the establishment of a pioneering diatom community at c. 6500 cal. yr BP. Decreased organic sedimentation after c. 2000 cal. yr BP suggests cooler conditions. Additionally, changing niveo-eolian deposition of sand on lake ice varied with a c. 3000-year periodicity through the entire record. The South Lake multiproxy record supports the hypothesis that the Brock Plateau was one of the earliest deglaciated regions during the late Wisconsinan. | ['beierle', 'dyke', 'lamoureux', 'ruehland', 'smol', 'st', 'jacques'] | ","['beierle', 'dyke', 'lamoureux', 'ruehland', 'smol', 'st', 'jacques']",4
155,"Latest Pleistocene and Holocene glacier fluctuations in western Canada | We summarize evidence of the latest Pleistocene and Holocene glacier fluctuations in the Canadian Cordillera. Our review focuses primarily on studies completed after 1988, when the first comprehensive review of such evidence was published. The Cordilleran ice sheet reached its maximum extent about 16 ka and then rapidly decayed. Some lobes of the ice sheet, valley glaciers, and cirque glaciers advanced one or more times between 15 and 11 ka. By 11 ka, or soon thereafter, glacier cover in the Cordillera was no more extensive than at the end of the 20th century. Glaciers were least extensive between 11 and 7 ka. A general expansion of glaciers began as early as 8.4 ka when glaciers overrode forests in the southern Coast Mountains; it culminated with the climactic advances of the Little Ice Age. Holocene glacier expansion was not continuous, but rather was punctuated by advances and retreats on a variety of timescales. Radiocarbon ages of wood collected from glacier forefields reveal six major periods of glacier advance: 8.59-8.18, 7.36-6.45, 4.40-3.97, 3.54-2.77, 1.71-1.30 ka, and the past millennium. Tree-ring and lichenometric dating shows that glaciers began their Little Ice Age advances as early as the 11th century and reached their maximum Holocene positions during the early 18th or mid-19th century. Our data confirm a previously suggested pattern of episodic but successively greater Holocene glacier expansion from the early Holocene to the climactic advances of the Little Ice Age, presumably driven by decreasing summer insolation throughout the Holocene. Proxy climate records indicate that glaciers advanced during the Little Ice Age in response to cold conditions that coincided with times of sunspot minima. Priority research required to further advance our understanding of late Pleistocene and Holocene glaciation in western Canada includes constraining the age of late Pleistocene moraines in northern British Columbia and Yukon Territory, expanding the use of cosmogenic surface exposure dating techniques, using multi-proxy paleoclimate approaches, and directing more of the research effort to the northern Canadian Cordillera.

156,"Leaf wax delta H-2 and varve-thickness climate proxies from proglacial lake sediments, Baffin Island, Arctic Canada | We present a multiproxy paleoclimate record using leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2(wax)) and varve thickness from Arctic proglacial lake sediments. We also provide one of the first evaluations of the utility of delta H-2(wax) as a paleoclimate proxy in Arctic proglacial lakes. We compare varve thickness and delta H-2(wax) at sub-decadal resolution from 1948 to 2004 AD, and at sub-centennial resolution from 1450 to 2004 AD. Varve thickness and delta H-2(wax) both contain large interannual variability and are anti-correlated during the late twentieth century, suggesting that both proxies respond rapidly, but by different mechanisms, to catchment-scale forcings. At longer time scales, varve thickness exhibits a strong response to Little Ice Age cooling (1661-1827 AD in this record) but does not show evidence for twentieth century warming recorded throughout the Arctic. delta H-2(wax) does record regional-scale temperature changes, with more H-2-depleted values during the Little Ice Age and an abrupt change to more H-2-enriched values in the twentieth century. This corresponds well with a recent Arctic-wide temperature reconstruction in which the seventeenth century is the coldest interval, and the twentieth century is the warmest interval. Our results suggest that delta H-2(wax) is a promising proxy that can be applied at high resolution in proglacial Arctic lakes. | ['briner', 'huang', 'mcgrane', 'thomas'] | ","['briner', 'huang', 'mcgrane', 'thomas']",2
157,"Lipid Biomarkers Quantify Holocene Summer Temperature and Ice Cap Sensitivity in Icelandic Lakes | Although recent research has made significant advances in characterizing Iceland's Holocene environmental history, the region still lacks reliable and continuous records of corresponding paleotemperature. Here we merge bacterial and algal lipid biomarkers (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and long-chain alkenones, respectively) to quantify Holocene temperature change from a small lake in northwest Iceland. Our local proxy record shows that early Holocene and late Holocene temperatures ranged from 3.2 to -1.1 degrees C relative today, which are in close agreement with independent estimates from regional ice cap models. At 2.4 ka, we observe abrupt cooling across bacteria-, algae-, and glacier-derived proxy records, which may have been initiated by extratropical volcanism and/or ocean/atmospheric climate variability of the North Atlantic region. Using early Holocene warmth and ice cap demise as an analog for modern climate change, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature projections suggest that the local ice cap, Drangajokull, could vanish by similar to 2050 CE. | ['curtin', 'dandrea', 'geirsdottir', 'harning', 'miller', 'sepulveda'] | ","['curtin', 'dandrea', 'geirsdottir', 'harning', 'miller', 'sepulveda']",2
158,"Little Ice Age recorded in summer temperature reconstruction from varved sediments of Donard Lake, Baffin Island, Canada | Clastic varved sediments from Donard Lake, in the Cape Dyer region of Baffin Island, provide a 1250 yr record of decadal-to-centennial scale climate variability. Donard Lake experiences strong seasonal fluctuations in runoff and sediment fluxes due to the summer melting of the Caribou Glacier, which presently dominates its catchment. The seasonal variation in sediment supply results in the annual deposition of laminae couplets. A radiocarbon date measured on moss fragments, with a calibrated age of 860 +- 80 yrs before present (BP), is in close agreement with the age based on paired-layer counts. Together with the fabric of the laminae determined from microscope analysis, the age agreement demonstrates that the laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Comparisons of varve thickness and average summer temperature from nearby Cape Dyer show a significant positive correlation (r = 0.57 for annual records, r = 0.82 for 3-yr averages), indicating that varve thickness reflects changes in average summer temperature. Varve thickness was used to reconstruct average summer temperatures for the past 1250 yrs, and shows abrupt shifts and large amplitude decadal-to-centennial scale variability throughout the record. The most prominent feature of the record is a period of elevated summer temperatures from 1200-1375 AD, followed by cooler conditions from 1375-1820 AD, coincident with the Little Ice Age. | ['hughen', 'miller', 'moore', 'overpeck'] | ","['hughen', 'miller', 'moore', 'overpeck']",4
159,"Local glaciation in West Greenland linked to North Atlantic Ocean circulation during the Holocene | Recent observations indicate that ice-ocean interaction drives much of the recent increase in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet; however, the role of ocean forcing in driving past glacier change is poorly understood. To extend the observational record and our understanding of the ocean-cryosphere link, we used a multi-proxy approach that combines new data from proglacial lake sediments, C-14-dated in situ moss that recently emerged from beneath cold-based ice caps, and Be-10 ages to reconstruct centennial-scale records of mountain glacier activity for the past similar to 10 k. y. in West Greenland. Proglacial lake sediment records and C-14 dating of moss indicate the onset of Neoglaciation in West Greenland at ca. 5 ka with substantial snowline lowering and glacier expansion at ca. 3.7 ka followed by additional ice expansion phases at ca. 2.9, ca. 1.7, and ca. 1.4 ka and during the Little Ice Age. We find that widespread glacier growth at ca. 3.7 ka in West Greenland coincides with marked cooling and reduced strength of the West Greenland Current in Disko Bugt. The transition to cooler ocean conditions at ca. 3.7 ka identified in Disko Bugt is registered by marine proxy data farther afield in East Greenland and on the northwestern Icelandic shelf, implying large-scale paleoceanographic changes across the North Atlantic during this interval. The similarity between glacier change on West Greenland and multiple marine and terrestrial records across the North Atlantic suggests that glaciers are strongly influenced by changes in ocean circulation and consequently implies that the ocean-cryosphere teleconnection is a persistent feature of the Arctic system. | ['bennike', 'briner', 'miller', 'schweinsberg', 'thomas'] | ","['bennike', 'briner', 'miller', 'schweinsberg', 'thomas']",1
160,"The magnitudes of millennial- and orbital-scale climatic change in eastern North America during the Late Quaternary | Temporal differences among fossil pollen samples from eastern North America provide a measure of the amount of climatic change that occurred on a broad spatial scale since the last glacial maximum (21,000 cal yr BP). Square-chord distances (SCDs) quantify the difference between pollen samples, and, thus, represent the potential magnitude of climatic change underlying the pollen record. The magnitude varied significantly among time scales with small changes common at centennial to millennial scales and large changes common at multi-millennial (i.e. orbital) scales. SCDs measured across 3000-yr intervals averaged 0.20, and often exceeded the maximum difference expected from samples collected within the same biome (0.15). SCDs across individual millennia were smaller and averaged 0.08. SCDs across the millennia at the beginning (13,000-12,000cal yr BP) and end (12,000-11,000 cat yr BP) of the Younger Dryas chronozone (12,900-11,600 cal yr BP), however, averaged 0.20 and 0.18, respectively. These rapid step changes, large at sub-millennial scales, equal about 5-25% of the total glacial-interglacial transition. Large magnitude progressive changes in insolation, ice sheet extent, and atmospheric composition parallel the dominant trends in the SCD data, which show that progressive change comprises the first-order climatic pattern of the Holocene rather than stable or oscillatory patterns.

161,"The two major warming phases of the last deglaciation at similar to 14.7 and similar to 11.5 ka cal BP in Europe: climate reconstructions and AGCM experiments | During the last deglaciation two distinct warming phases occurred in the N Atlantic region at similar to 14.7 and similar to 11.5 ka cal BP. These two shifts are the transitions from (1) GS-2a (Greenland Stadial 2a) to GI-1e (Greenland Interstadial 1e) and (2) GS-1 to the Preboreal. In this study we characterise these two important climate transitions by comparing maps of January and July temperatures for Europe acquired with two independent methods: (1) simulations with the ECHAM4 atmospheric general circulation model in T42 resolution and (2) temperature reconstructions based on geological and palaeoecological data. We also compare estimated lake level changes with simulated P-E (effective precipitation) values. These comparisons enable quantification of the climate change during the two phases. January temperatures increased by as much as 20 degreesC in NW Europe from values between - 25 degreesC and - 15 degreesC in both GS-2a and GS-1 to temperatures between - 5 degreesC and 5 degreesC in both GI-le and the Preboreal. During July the changes were smaller, as the July temperatures increased in NW Europe by 3-5 degreesC from about 10 degreesC to 15 degreesC in both GS-2a and GS-1 to values of 13 degreesC to 17 degreesC in both GI-1e and the Preboreal. In S Europe the increase in July temperature was less intense. Our analysis suggests that the effective precipitation remained at the same level during the 14.7 ka cal BP transition, whereas a small increase is inferred for some regions for the 11.5 ka cal BP shift. This small effect in effective precipitation is explained by comparable increases in precipitation and evaporation during both transitions. We infer that the strong increase in January temperatures was forced by changes in the N Atlantic Ocean, as the variations in sea surface temperatures and the position of the sea ice margin determined the temperature chan-e over land. The increase in July temperatures was mainly driven by two factors: the increase in insolation and the deglaciation in Scotland and Scandinavia. The insolation changes were gradual (2 to 3 W/m(2)) compared to the changes in the N Atlantic Ocean, explaining the relatively small temperature increase during July compared to January, In regions that were deglaciated during the two climate transitions, July temperatures appeared to have increased by up to 10 degreesC. Our results suggest that the registration of the magnitude of the two climate shifts in terrestrial proxy records was geographically different due to the changing environmental conditions; variations in the N Atlantic sea ice limit appear to be the most important. This implies that reconstructed temperature curves from different places in Europe should show different magnitudes. Moreover, it is to be expected that the timing of the major warming phases is spatially different, as this timing is mainly determined by the position of the sea ice and land ice margins relative to the place of interest.

A variety of facies types and Facies sequences, controlled primarily by sea-level change and influenced also by climatic factors, is recognized. Main facies types are: (I) Marine (mud and sand), (II) Transitional (laminated gyttja or gyttja and silt), (III) Lacustrine (gyttja/plant detritus), and (IV) Mixed (gyttia, mud and sand/gravel). Laminated transitional facies II. in nearly all cases, is interpreted as having formed under meromictic limnic conditions following basin isolation From the sea, whereas heterolithic mixed facies IV forms usually under littoral influence during ingression. Sea-level displacement curves are constructed for Lyngen and Vanna based on radiocarbon-dated isolation and ingression contacts, elevation/inferred-age data For prominent raised shorelines, and other data. The evidence suggests that the Tapes transgression at Lyngen had a minimum amplitude of 2-3 m and peaked at ca. 7000 BP. Average rates of pre-Tapes (before 8500 BP) and post-Tapes (after 6000 BP) regression are approximately 15 and 3 mm/year respectively at Lyngen. and 10 and 1.5 mm/year respectively at Vanna. | ['corner', 'haugane'] | ","['corner', 'haugane']",4
163,"Medieval climate warming and aridity as indicated by multiproxy evidence from the Kola Peninsula, Russia | Data obtained from the low-elevation Kbibiny Mountains (ca. 67-68degreeN; 33-34degreeE) on the Kola Peninsula, northwest Russia, indicate a period of exceptionally warm and dry conditions commenced at ca. AD 600 and was most pronounced between ca. AD 1000 and 1200. Warmer summer temperatures during this period (coeval with the 'Medieval Warm Period' observed in other parts of Europe) are evident in a 100-140 m upward shift in the pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) limit in the Khibiny Mountains. On average, the cellulose of pine trees that grew between ca. AD 1000 and 1300 is enriched by delta13C values of around 1permillcompared to the modem trees from the region, further suggesting warmer summer climate than at present. The Medieval Warm Period was also accompanied by a steady decline in avalanche activity and the resulting fort-nation of soils on the current avalanche cones in the Khibiny Mountains, suggesting lower winter precipitation and thinner snow cover. Lower precipitation is also evident by currently submerged tree stumps dating to the medieval period that indicate lower lake levels on the Kola Peninsula. In the middle of the peninsula at about AD 1000, the level of small closed-basin lakes was apprx1 m lower than the modem time at some sites. Drier conditions may be attributable to decreased cyclonic activity. The medieval warm and dry episode was followed at ca. AD 1300 by the development of a colder climate with increased precipitation resulting in a decline in the alpine pine limits, increased avalanche activity, and higher lake levels. That phase corresponds to the modem aeolian episode reconstructed in subarctic Finland. Our results indicate that the Medieval Warm Period on the Kola Peninsula experienced notably warm and dry conditions. Hence, this period of warming extends to northwestern Russia as well as other parts of Europe. Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.

164,"Was There a Medieval Warm Period, and If So, Where and When | It has frequently been suggested that the period encompassing the ninth to the fourteenth centuries A.D. experienced a climate warmer than that prevailing around the turn of the twentieth century. This epoch has become known as the Medieval Warm Period, since it coincides with the Middle Ages in Europe. In this review a number of lines of evidence are considered, (including climate-sensitive tree rings, documentary sources, and montane glaciers) in order to evaluate whether it is reasonable to conclude that climate in medieval times was, indeed, warmer than the climate of more recent times. Our review indicates that for some areas of the globe (for example, Scandinavia, China, the Sierra Nevada in California, the Canadian Rockies and Tasmania), temperatures, particularly in summer, appear to have been higher during some parts of this period than those that were to prevail until the most recent decades of the twentieth century. These warmer regional episodes were not strongly synchronous. Evidence from other regions (for example, the Southeast United States, southern Europe along the Mediterranean, and parts of South America) indicates that the climate during that time was little different to that of later times, or that warming, if it occurred, was recorded at a later time than has been assumed. Taken together, the available evidence does not support a global Medieval Warm Period, although more support for such a phenomenon could be drawn from high-elevation records than from low-elevation records. The available data exhibit significant decadal to century scale variability throughout the last millennium. A comparison of 30-year averages for various climate indices places recent decades in a longer term perspective. | ['diaz', 'hughes'] | ","['diaz', 'hughes']",2
165,"Medieval warmth confirmed at the Norse Eastern Settlement in Greenland | Recent work has documented glacier advances in West Greenland coincident with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and warmth across much of northern Europe. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been invoked to explain antiphasing of temperatures between these North Atlantic regions. Historical and model observations suggest negative correlation between the mode of NAO and both temperature and delta O-18 values of precipitation over much of Greenland. We test for a hypothesized positive NAO mode and associated cool conditions during the MCA in South Greenland within the Norse Eastern Settlement by reconstructing delta O-18 values of precipitation at subcentennial resolution over the past 3000 yr using aquatic insect subfossils preserved in lake sediments. More positive delta O-18 values are found between 900 and 1400 CE, indicating a period of warmth in South Greenland superimposed on late Holocene insolation-forced Neoglacial cooling, and thus not supporting a positive NAO anomaly during the MCA. Highly variable delta O-18 values record an unstable climate at the end of the MCA, preceding Norse abandonment of Greenland. The spatial pattern of paleoclimate in this region supports proposals that North Atlantic subpolar ocean currents modulated South Greenland's climate over the past 3000 yr, particularly during the MCA. Terrestrial climate in the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay regions may be spatially heterogeneous on centennial time scales due in part to the influence of the subpolar gyre. | ['axford', 'lasher'] | ","['axford', 'lasher']",1
166,"Methane turnover and environmental change from Holocene lipid biomarker records in a thermokarst lake in Arctic Alaska | Arctic lakes and wetlands contribute a substantial amount of methane to the contemporary atmosphere, yet profound knowledge gaps remain regarding the intensity and climatic control of past methane emissions from this source. In this study, we reconstruct methane turnover and environmental conditions, including estimates of mean annual and summer temperature, from a thermokarst lake (Lake Qalluuraq) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska for the Holocene by using source-specific lipid biomarkers preserved in a radiocarbon-dated sediment core. Our results document a more prominent role for methane in the carbon cycle when the lake basin was an emergent fen habitat between similar to 12,300 and similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a time period closely coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in North Alaska. Enhanced methane turnover was stimulated by relatively warm temperatures, increased moisture, nutrient supply, and primary productivity. After similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a thermokarst lake with abundant submerged mosses evolved, and through the mid-Holocene temperatures were approximately 3 degrees C cooler. Under these conditions, organic matter decomposition was attenuated, which facilitated the accumulation of submerged mosses within a shallower Lake Qalluuraq. Reduced methane assimilation into biomass during the mid-Holocene suggests that thermokarst lakes are carbon sinks during cold periods. In the late-Holocene from similar to 2700 cal yr BP to the most recent time, however, temperatures and carbon deposition rose and methane oxidation intensified, indicating that more rapid organic matter decomposition and enhanced methane production could amplify climate feedback via potential methane emissions in the future. | ['becker', 'elvert', 'gaglioti', 'hinrichs', 'pohlman', 'wooller'] | ","['becker', 'elvert', 'gaglioti', 'hinrichs', 'pohlman', 'wooller']",2

Based upon the assembled characters and ecological features of the microfauna in the borehole AB-67, environmental changes in Barrow, Alaska in the past 450 years can be recognized as follows : (1) Before 1740 AD (e. g. from the mid of the 16th century to the 18th century), It was relatively cold and in a low sea level stage, which were concluded by the existence of both marine and non-marine micro-fauna. The non-marine ostracoda indicates a lake-stream deposition environment with fresh-brackish water. The marine micro-fauna was likely eurythermal and euryhaline forms, so the drilling site was estimated to be located at a river mouth or in a tidal zone near the coast and the sea level might be 2. 5m lower than that of the present between the mid-16 century and mid-18 century, which coincided with a little ice age.

We have shown that not only are these models different in their simulations of the PI climate, but also in their simulations of the climatic anomalies for the MH and LGM. In the Part 2 of this paper, we first examine whether palaeo-data can help discriminate between the model performances. This is indeed the case for the African monsoon for the MH or for North America south of the Laurentide ice sheet, the South Atlantic or the southern Indian ocean for the LGM. For the LGM, off-line vegetation modelling appears to offer good opportunities to distinguish climate model results because glacial vegetation proves to be very sensitive to even small differences in LGM climate. For other cases such as the LGM North Atlantic or the LGM equatorial Pacific, the large uncertainty on the SST reconstructions, prevents model discrimination. We have examined the use of other proxy-data for model evaluation, which has become possible with the inclusion of the biogeochemistry morel PISCES in the IPSL_CM5A model. We show a broad agreement of the LGM-PI export production changes with reconstructions. These changes are related to the mixed layer depth in most regions and to sea-ice variations in the high latitudes. We have also modelled foraminifer abundances with the FORAMCLIM model and shown that the changes in foraminifer abundance in the equatorial Pacific are mainly forced by changes in SSTs, hence confirming the SST-foraminifer abundance relationship. Yet, this is not the case in all regions in the North Atlantic, where food availability can have a strong impact of foraminifer abundances. Further work will be needed to exhaustively examine the role of factors other than climate in piloting changes in palaeo-indicators. ¬© 2012 Springer-Verlag. | ['bopp', 'braconnot', 'caubel', 'foujols', 'guilyardi', 'kageyama', 'khodri', 'lloyd', 'lombard', 'mariotti', 'marti', 'roy', 'woillez'] | ","['bopp', 'braconnot', 'caubel', 'foujols', 'guilyardi', 'kageyama', 'khodri', 'lloyd', 'lombard', 'mariotti', 'marti', 'roy', 'woillez']",1

170,"Mid-Holocene palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological conditions in northeastern European Russia: A multi-proxy study of Lake Vankavad | Mid-Holocene changes in vegetation, palaeohydrology and climate were investigated from the sediments of Lake Vankavad in the northern taiga of the Usa Basin, NE European Russia, through the analysis of pollen, plant macrofossils, Cladocera and diatoms. Lake Vankavad was probably formed at ca. 5000 BP (ca. 5600 cal. BP) and initially it was shallow with a littoral cladoceran fauna. Macrofossil and pollen results suggest that dense Betula-Picea forests grew in the vicinity and the shore was close to the sampling point. At ca. 4600 BP (ca. 5400 cal. BP) the water level rose coincident with the decrease in the density and area of forests, probably caused by cooling climate and accelerated spread of mires. There was also a further rise in the water level at ca. 3500 BP (ca. 3800 cal. BP). The initiation of the lake, followed by two periods of rising water-level, as well as the increase in mire formation, was a consequence of a rise in groundwater level. This probably reflects lower evapotranspiration in a cooling mid-Holocene climate and/or higher precipitation in the lowland area. Also the decreased forest density and area may have contributed to the lower evapotranspiration. It is also possible that permafrost aggradation or changes in peat ecosystems might have affected the hydrological conditions in the area. | ['kultti', 'sarmaja', 'korjonen', 'solovieva', 'valiranta'] | ","['kultti', 'sarmaja', 'korjonen', 'solovieva', 'valiranta']",2
171,"Middle to late Holocene chironomid-inferred July temperatures for the central Northwest Territories, Canada | We analyzed subfossil chironomids, sediment organic matter and sediment particle size data from a 1.11-m-long freeze core collected from Carleton Lake (unofficial name), located approximately 120 km north of the modern treeline. This well-dated core spans the last ca. 6,500 years. Two chironomid transfer functions were applied to infer mean July air temperatures. Our results indicated that the chironomid-inferred temperatures from this lake sediment record did not pass a significance test, suggesting that other factors in addition to temperature may have been important in structuring the chironomid community through time. Although not statistically significant, the chironomid-inferred temperatures from this site do follow a familiar pattern, with highest inferred temperatures occurring during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (similar to 6-4 cal kyr BP), followed by a long-term cooling trend, which is reversed during the last 600 years. The largest change in the chironomid assemblage, which occurred between ca. 4,600 and 3,900 cal yr BP is possibly related to the well-documented northward advance and subsequent retreat of treeline in this region. | ['crann', 'falck', 'galloway', 'macumber', 'neville', 'patterson', 'pisaric', 'roe', 'swindle', 'upiter', 'vermaire'] | ","['crann', 'falck', 'galloway', 'macumber', 'neville', 'patterson', 'pisaric', 'roe', 'swindle', 'upiter', 'vermaire']",1
172,"A 2000 year midge-based paleotemperature reconstruction from the Canadian Arctic archipelago | A lake sediment core recovered from Lake V57 on Victoria Island, Nunavut, Canada, spanning the last 2000 years, was analyzed for sub-fossil midge remains and organic-matter content (estimated by loss-on-ignition (LOI)). Significant changes in midge community composition occurred during the last 2000 years, with a distinct midge community appearing after 1600 AD. The chironomid community between 0 and 1600 AD was dominated by Heterotrissocladius, Tanytarsus, Abiskomyia, and Paracladius. At approximately 1600 AD, Heterotrissocladius decreased in relative abundance and taxa such as Corynocera ambigua, C. oliveri, Psectrocladius sordidellus type, and Pentanneurini increased in relative abundance. Previously published midge-based inference models for average July air temperature (AJAT) and summer surface-water temperature (SSWT) were applied to the subfossil midge stratigraphy. The AJAT reconstruction indicates relatively cool conditions existed between 1100 and 1600 AD, with exceptional warming occuring after 1600 AD, as lake productivity inferred from organic-matter content increased concomitantly with midge-inferred AJAT and SSWT. The cooler conditions between 1200 and 1600 AD, and the pattern of warming over recent centuries inferred from Lake V57 is broadly consistent with temperature-sensitive biogenic silica records from other sites in the central Canadian Arctic and the treeline zone to the south suggesting a regionally synchronous response to climate forcing. | ['macdonald', 'porinchu', 'rolland'] | ","['macdonald', 'porinchu', 'rolland']",4
173,"Midge-inferred Holocene effective moisture fluctuations in a subarctic lake, northern Lapland | We examined fossil midge (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages from Lake Varddoaijavri, northern Finland to track Holocene effective moisture variability. Application of a midge-based water-depth calibration model showed that the early Holocene was characterized by a high water level compared with the Holocene average, but the inferred values decreased at c. 8000 cal. a BP and increased again towards c. 6000 cal. a BP. The inferred water level decreased at c. 5500 cal. a BP, but increased again towards c. 4000 cal. a BP. Between 4000 and 3000 cal. a BP the lake experienced two rapid events of lower water level. A relatively high water level detected at c. 3000 cal. a BP was followed by a lowering towards c. 2000 cal. a BP. The time period from c. 2000 cal. a BP onwards was characterized by a general rise in lake level towards the present. Overall, the present reconstruction shows a close correspondence in its trends to previous lake-level records in the region. Two common core taxa, Paratanytarsus and Corynocera ambigua, did not correlate significantly with water depth in the calibration data, creating a potential error source for the present lake-level reconstruction. However, statistical analysis showed a clear community response to long-term lake-level changes, and therefore the major trends in Holocene effective moisture patterns were revealed. The present palaeoclimatic information can also serve as valuable background data when assessing the effects of the present climate change. | ['luoto', 'sarmaja', 'korjonen'] | ","['luoto', 'sarmaja', 'korjonen']",0
174,"Midge-inferred Holocene summer temperatures in Southeastern British Columbia, Canada | Using fossil midge stratigraphies, we inferred Holocene summer temperatures at three subalpine lakes in eastern British Columbia. The late-glacial sediment indicated cool conditions, with an abundance of Microspectra atrofasciata/radialis type fossils at Thunder Lake and Redmountain Lake, and Sergentia at Windy Lake. Sergentia and Tanytarsus lugens/Corynocera oliveri type were dominant in the early Holocene, together with Chironomus at Redmountain Lake. At Thunder and Windy lakes, the early Holocene was dominated by warm-adapted taxa such as Microtendipes. Quantitative midge-temperature inference models reconstruct a 4 to 8 degrees C rise in mean July air temperature for Windy and Thunder lakes at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Early-Holocene temperatures averaged 3 to 4 degrees C warmer than those extant today. In contrast, no long-term temperature trend was evident at Redmountain Lake. This site may not reflect actual trends in air temperature due to runoff from a persistent snow pack in the watershed. Comparison of midge and pollen data suggests an inverse relationship between summer temperature and precipitation through the middle to late Holocene. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

175,"Millennial-scale variability in Holocene aquatic productivity from Burial Lake, Arctic Alaska | Holocene records of lacustrine primary production are commonly used to reconstruct past changes in environmental and climatic conditions. While several methods exist to infer paleoproductivity trends, few studies to date have applied multiple geochemical indices in the same core sequence from Arctic lakes to evaluate their fidelity and sensitivity to specific climate variables over long (Holocene length) timescales. In this study, we evaluate sub-century to millennial-scale fluctuations in paleoproductivity over the Holocene using geochemical (biogenic opal and sedimentary chlorin) analyses of sediments from Burial Lake in the western Brooks Range, Alaska. Large fluctuations in opal and related proxies occur at millennial timescales over the last 10,000 years. We interpret the changes in opal to result from variability in diatom productivity, which is indirectly mediated by climate primarily through changes in the duration of the ice-free growing season and the availability of limiting nutrients at this oligotrophic, tundra lake. Comparison of the opal and sedimentary chlorin record, which is correlated with TOC, shows contrasting patterns on both short (century to multi-century) and relatively long (millennial) time scales. The concentration of opal far exceeds that of TOC and variations in sediment dry bulk density, driven by changes in the accumulation of opal, are likely responsible in part for the variations in sedimentary chlorin. Further, C/N ratio values indicate a mixed algal-terrestrial source of sedimentary organic matter. This result highlights the complexity in the climatic interpretation of sedimentary chlorin as an index of whole lake production, because the signal is prone to dilution/concentration from opal and also reflects a combination of aquatic and terrestrial production. Time series analysis of the productivity records indicates the presence of a significant similar to 1500-yr oscillation in opal concentration, which has been found in North Atlantic Ocean proxy records and numerous other marine and terrestrial paleorecords. Comparison of diatom productivity against a sea-ice inferred reconstruction of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) from the Beaufort Sea (Darby et al., 2012) shows that periods of reduced productivity at Burial Lake coincide with inferred positive phases of the AO (AO+). Combined with modern observations of sea ice extent and meteorological data, we hypothesize that AO + conditions and a strengthened polar jet correspond with a shortened ice-free growing season, a decrease in the availability of limiting nutrients, and lower levels of diatom production at Burial Lake. Comparison of the spectral properties between opal and the AO reconstruction reveal similar millennial scale variations with similar to 1500-yr variability during the middle Holocene that transition to similar to 1000-yr variability during the late Holocene. In light of these findings, we suggest the possibility that millennial variations in diatom productivity observed in the Burial Lake record are related to millennial variability in high-latitude atmospheric circulation similar to the AO. These results shed light on the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems in northern Alaska to changes in the duration of the ice-free growing season, the availability of limiting nutrients for phytoplankton growth, and Arctic-wide atmospheric circulation dynamics over the Holocene on millennial timescales.

176,"2.8 Million Years of Arctic Climate Change from Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Russia | The reliability of Arctic climate predictions is currently hampered by insufficient knowledge of natural climate variability in the past. A sediment core from Lake El'gygytgyn in northeastern (NE) Russia provides a continuous, high-resolution record from the Arctic, spanning the past 2.8 million years. This core reveals numerous ""super interglacials"" during the Quaternary; for marine benthic isotope stages (MIS) 11c and 31, maximum summer temperatures and annual precipitation values are similar to 4 degrees to 5 degrees C and similar to 300 millimeters higher than those of MIS 1 and 5e. Climate simulations show that these extreme warm conditions are difficult to explain with greenhouse gas and astronomical forcing alone, implying the importance of amplifying feedbacks and far field influences.

177,"Minimal Holocene retreat of large tidewater glaciers in Koge Bugt, southeast Greenland | Koge Bugt, in southeast Greenland, hosts three of the largest glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet; these have been major contributors to ice loss in the last two decades. Despite its importance, the Holocene history of this area has not been investigated. We present a 9100 year sediment core record of glaciological and oceanographic changes from analysis of foraminiferal assemblages, the abundance of ice-rafted debris, and sortable silt grain size data. Results show that ice-rafted debris accumulated constantly throughout the core; this demonstrates that glaciers in Koge Bugt remained in tidewater settings throughout the last 9100 years. This observation constrains maximum Holocene glacier retreat here to less than 6 km from present-day positions. Retreat was minimal despite oceanic and climatic conditions during the early-Holocene that were at least as warm as the present-day. The limited Holocene retreat of glaciers in Koge Bugt was controlled by the subglacial topography of the area; the steeply sloping bed allowed glaciers here to stabilise during retreat. These findings underscore the need to account for individual glacier geometry when predicting future behaviour. We anticipate that glaciers in Koge Bugt will remain in stable configurations in the near-future, despite the predicted continuation of atmospheric and oceanic warming. | ['andresen', 'bjork', 'dyke', 'hiemstra', 'hughes', 'murray', 'seidenkrantz', 'sutherland', 'vermassen'] | ","['andresen', 'bjork', 'dyke', 'hiemstra', 'hughes', 'murray', 'seidenkrantz', 'sutherland', 'vermassen']",4
178,"Holocene mountain glacier history in the Sukkertoppen Iskappe area, southwest Greenland | Mountain glaciers and ice caps (GIC) independent of the Greenland Ice Sheet respond rapidly to climate variations and records of their past extent provide information on the natural envelope of climate variability. Here, we use a multi-proxy approach that combines proglacial lake sediment analysis, cosmogenic nuclide surface-exposure dating (in situ Be-10 and C-14), and radiocarbon dating of recently ice-entombed moss to generate a centennial-scale record of Holocene GIC fluctuations in southwestern Greenland. Following local deglaciation similar to 10-9 ka, sediments from proglacial Crash Lake record a glacier advance at similar to 9 ka that is indistinguishable from nearby ice sheet moraines, implying a synchronous response of GIC and the Greenland Ice Sheet to a centennial-scale climate event. Following this local glacier advance, GIC experienced net recession until similar to 4.6 ka. Radiocarbon ages of in situ moss (n = 29) and Crash Lake sediments reveal intervals of glacier expansion at similar to 1.8, 1.2 and 0.7 ka that are superimposed on an overall trend of net glacier expansion throughout the late Holocene. In situ C-14 concentrations from bedrock adjacent to radiocarbon-dated moss samples further constrain the duration of ice cover through the Holocene in this region. We find that our glacier-size proxy records during the past similar to 4 ka are broadly consistent with relatively lower temperatures recorded in GISP2 and occur during, or following, intervals of volcanic perturbations. Thus, we speculate that volcanic activity, although less frequent and intense than in the early Holocene and during the Little Ice Age, may have led to centennial-scale variability imprinted on net glacier expansion due to decreasing summer insolation through the late Holocene.

179,"A multi-method approach to dating middle and late Quaternary high relative sea-level events on NW Svalbard - A case study | Waxing and waning ice sheets and changing sea levels have been interpreted from the Quaternary stratigraphic record at Leinstranda, Broggerhalvoya in NW Svalbard. We have identified seven high relative sea-level events, related to glacio-isostatic loading, and separated by at least four glacial events. To establish a chronology for the high sea-level events (interstadials and interglacials) and the intervening glaciations, we have used three different absolute dating methods: optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of shallow marine deposits, and electron spin resonance (ESR) and radiocarbon (AMS-C-14) dating of fossils contained in these sediments. Of the absolute dating methods, OSL has provided the stratigraphically most consistent dataset and which also matches a biostratigraphically inferred interglacial. The ESR ages of mollusc shells suffer from low precision due to unusually large uranium content in most dated shell samples, which in turn is most likely a result of significant recent uranium enrichment of the sediments. Most radiocarbon ages are non-finite. The results show that the high relative sea-level events range in age from the Saalian sensu lato (>= Marine Isotope Stage, MIS, 6) to the early Holocene (MIS 1), and include events OSL-dated to 185 +/- 8 ka, 129 +/- 10 ka, 99 +/- 8 ka and 36 +/- 3 ka.

180,"Multi-proxy dating of Iceland's major pre-settlement Katla eruption to 822-823 CE | Investigations of the impacts of past volcanic eruptions on climate, environment, and society require accurate chronologies. However, eruptions that are not recorded in historical documents can seldom be dated exactly. Here we use annually resolved radiocarbon (C-14) measurements to isolate the 775 CE cosmogenic C-14 peak in a subfossil birch tree that was buried by a glacial outburst flood in southern Iceland. We employ this absolute time marker to date a subglacial eruption of Katla volcano at late 822 CE to early 823 CE. We argue for correlation between the 822-823 CE eruption and a conspicuous sulfur anomaly evident in Greenland ice cores, which follows in the wake of an even larger volcanic signal (ca. 818-820 CE) as yet not attributed to a known eruption. An abrupt summer cooling in 824 CE, evident in tree-ring reconstructions for Fennoscandia and the Northern Hemisphere, suggests a climatic response to the Katla eruption. Written historical sources from Europe and China corroborate our proposed tree ring-radiocarbon-ice core linkage but also point to combined effects of eruptions occurring during this period. Our study describes the oldest precisely dated, high-latitude eruption and reveals the impact of an extended phase of volcanic forcing in the early 9th century. It also provides insight into the existence of prehistoric woodland cover and the nature of volcanism several decades before Iceland's permanent settlement began. | ['buntgen', 'di', 'cosmo', 'eggertsson', 'esper', 'krusic', 'lane', 'ljungqvist', 'newfield', 'oppenheimer', 'plunkett', 'reinig', 'sigl', 'wacker'] | ","['buntgen', 'di', 'cosmo', 'eggertsson', 'esper', 'krusic', 'lane', 'ljungqvist', 'newfield', 'oppenheimer', 'plunkett', 'reinig', 'sigl', 'wacker']",4
181,"A multi-proxy lacustrine record of Holocene climate change on northeastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada | Reconstructions of past environmental changes are critical for understanding the natural variability of Earth's climate system and for providing a context for present and future global change. Radiocarbon-dated lake sediments from Lake CF3, northeastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, are used to reconstruct past environmental conditions over the last 11,200 years. Numerous proxies, including chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, diatom-inferred lakewater pH, and sediment organic matter, reveal a pronounced Holocene thermal maximum as much as 5 degrees C warmer than historic summer temperatures from similar to 10,000 to 8500 cal yr B.P. Following rapid cooling similar to 8500 cal yr B.P., Lake CF3 proxies indicate cooling through the late Holocene. At many sites in northeastern Canada, the Holocene thermal maximum occurred later than at Lake CF3; this late onset of Holocene warmth is generally attributed to the impacts of the decaying Laurentide Ice Sheet on early Holocene temperatures in northeastern Canada. However, the lacustrine proxies in Lake CF3 apparently responded to insolation-driven warnith, despite the proximity of Lake CF3 to the Laurentide Ice Sheet and its meltwater. The magnitude and timing of the Holocene thermal maximum at Lake CF3 indicate that temperatures and environmental conditions at this site are highly sensitive to changes in radiative forcing.

182,"A multi-proxy record of the Last Glacial Maximum and last 14,500 years of paleoenvironmental change at Lone Spruce Pond, southwestern Alaska | Sediment cores from Lone Spruce Pond (60.007 degrees N, 159.143 degrees W), southwestern Alaska, record paleoenvironmental changes during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and during the last 14,500 calendar years BP (14.5 cal ka). We analyzed the abundance of organic matter, biogenic silica, carbon, and nitrogen, and the isotope ratios of C and N, magnetic susceptibility, and grain-size distribution of bulk sediment, abundance of alder shrub (Alnus) pollen, and midge (Chironomidae and Chaoboridae) assemblages in a 4.7-m-long sediment sequence from the depocenter at 22 m water depth. The basal unit contains macrofossils dating to 25-21 cal ka (the global LGM), and is interpreted as glacial-lacustrine sediment. The open water requires that the outlet of the Ahklun Mountain ice cap had retreated to within 6 km of the range crest. In addition to cladocerans and diatoms, the glacial-lacustrine mud contains chironomids consistent with deep, oligotrophic conditions; several taxa associated with relatively warm conditions are present, suggestive of relative warmth during the global LGM. The glacial-lacustrine unit is separated from the overlying non-glacial lake sediment by a possible disconformity, which might record a readvance of glacier ice. Non-glacial sediment began accumulating around 14.5 cal ka, with high flux of mineral matter and fluctuating physical and biological properties through the global deglacial period, including a reversal in biogenic-silica (BSi) content during the Younger Dryas (YD). During the global deglacial interval, the delta C-13 values of lake sediment were higher relative to other periods, consistent with low C:N ratios (8), and suggesting a dominant atmospheric CO2 source of C for phytoplankton. Concentrations of aquatic faunal remains (chironomids and Cladocera) were low throughout the deglacial interval, diversity was low and warm-indicator taxa were absent. Higher production and air temperatures are inferred following the YD, when bulk organic-matter (OM) content (LOI 550 A degrees C) increased substantially and permanently, from 10 to 30 %, a trend paralleled by an increase in C and N abundance, an increase in C:N ratio (to about 12), and a decrease in delta C-13 of sediment. Post-YD warming is marked by a rapid shift in the midge assemblage. Between 8.9 and 8.5 cal ka, Alnus pollen tripled (25-75 %), followed by the near-tripling of BSi (7-19 %) by 8.2 cal ka, and delta N-15 began a steady rise, reflecting the buildup of N and an increase in denitrification in soils. Several chironomid taxa indicative of relatively warm conditions were present throughout the Holocene. Quantitative chironomid-based temperature inferences are complicated by the expansion of Alnus and resulting changes in lake nutrient status and production; these changes were associated with an abrupt increase in cladoceran abundance and persistent shift in the chironomid assemblage. During the last 2,000 years, chironomid-assemblage changes suggest cooler temperatures, and BSi and OM values were generally lower than their maximum Holocene values, with minima during the seventh and eighth centuries, and again during the eighteenth century. | ['anderson', 'axford', 'kaufman', 'lamoureux', 'schindler', 'walker', 'werner'] | ","['anderson', 'axford', 'kaufman', 'lamoureux', 'schindler', 'walker', 'werner']",4

NWT, Canada, provides the first continuous postglacial environmental record for the region. Fossil pollen results indicate that the postglacial landscape was dominated by Poaceae and Salix, typical of a High Arctic plant community, whereas the Arctic herb Oxyria underwent a gradual increase during the late Holocene. Pollen-based climate reconstructions suggests the presence of a cold and dry period similar to 12,000 cal yr BP, possibly representing the Younger Dryas, followed by warmer and wetter conditions from 11,000 to 5000 cal yr BP, likely reflective of the Holocene Thermal Maximum. The climate then underwent a gradual cooling and drying from 5000 cal yr BP to the present, suggesting a late Holocene neoglacial cooling. Diatom preservation was poor prior to 5000 cal yr BP, when conditions were warmest, suggesting that diatom dissolution may in part be climatically controlled. Diatom concentrations were highest similar to 4500 cal yr BP but then decreased substantially by 3500 cal yr BP and remained low before recovering slightly in the 20th century.

184,"A multiproxy-based reconstruction of the mid- to late Holocene paleoenvironment in the Laptev Sea off the Lena River Delta (Siberian Arctic) | Land-shelf interactions and related environmental changes were reconstructed for the past 6 cal. kyrs interpreting multiproxy records from the two AMS(14)C-dated sediment cores from the sites located to the north and northeast of the Lena River delta. Proxies used include terrestrial and aquatic palynomorphs, benthic/planktic foraminifers and ostracods paired with benthic delta O-18 and delta C-13 records of Haynesina orbiculare. The study focused on unravelling the relation between river runoff and the regional climate changes on the one hand, and its imprint on the shelf sea environment on timescales beyond the instrumental records on the other.The palynomorph records show that the Lena River outflow largely determined the composition of species associations and the magnitude of terrestrial matter influx from land. Pollen assemblages of the inner Laptev Sea shelf reflect complex pollen contribution of the Arctic tundra and remote taiga zones drained by the Lena River and indicate a vegetation response to warmer-than-present climatic conditions between 6.0 and 4.5 cal. ka and a subsequent gradual cooling. Fluvial influence in the records is manifested by (1) increases in sedimentation rates; (2) high influxes of pollen/spores and freshwater chlorophycean algae, wood and plant remains; (3) negative delta C-13 excursions due to the introduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from river water. Episodes of enhanced freshwater influence in the surface water layers (fluvial events) correlate with positive benthic 8580 excursions and increasing representation of river-distal species among benthics. Altogether, this points to an estuarine-like reversed (north to south) bottom current activity along the submarine paleovalleys on the shelf. The most pronounced fluvial events are recognized at 5.3-5.9, 1.5 and < 0.5 cal. ka. The oldest fluvial event coincides with the final stage of mid-Holocene climate warming. A fluvial event at 1.5 cal. ka is specifically strong at the northeastern site thus marking a direction change of the Lena River outflow at this time and the progressive protrusion of the delta. During the past 500 years distinct negative delta C-13 values at the northeastern site reflect enhanced riverine influence. It is therefore concluded that the unprecedented change in the delta C-13 trend corroborates the other evidence for a principal diversion of the major Lena River outflows into its present-day, easterly direction. | ['bauch', 'ovsepyan', 'rudenko', 'stepanova', 'taldenkova'] | ","['bauch', 'ovsepyan', 'rudenko', 'stepanova', 'taldenkova']",4

The water masses in the western Barents Sea were likely strongly stratified at the onset of the YD, possibly due to runoff of meltwater combined with perennial sea-ice cover, the latter may last up to several decades without any brake-up. Consequently, anoxic conditions prevailed at the bottom of Storfjordrenna, leading to a sharp reduction of benthic biota and the appearance of vivianite microconcretions which formation is favoured by reducing conditions. While the anoxic conditions in Storfjordrenna were transient, the unfavorable conditions for benthic foraminifera lasted for c. 1300 years. We suggest that the Pre-Boreal Oscillation, just after the onset of the Holocene, may have been a continuation of the oscillatory warming trend during the YD. | ['forwick', 'lacka', 'michalska', 'pawlowska', 'szczucinski', 'szymanska', 'zajaczkowski'] | ","['forwick', 'lacka', 'michalska', 'pawlowska', 'szczucinski', 'szymanska', 'zajaczkowski']",2
187,"Multiproxy paleoecological evidence of Holocene climatic changes on the Boothia Peninsula, Canadian Arctic | A study of chironomid remains in the sediments of Lake JR01 on the Boothia Peninsula in the Central Canadian Arctic provides a high-resolution record of mean July air temperatures for the last 6.9 ka. Diatom and pollen studies have previously been published from this core. Peak Holocene temperatures occurred prior to 5.0 ka, a time when overall aquatic and terrestrial biological production was high. Chironomid-inferred summer air temperatures reached up to 7.5 degrees C during this period. The region of Lake JR01 cooled over the mid- to late-Holocene, with high biological production between 6.1 and 5.4 ka. Biological production decreased again at similar to 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka, coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Although biological production increased in the last 150 yr, the reconstructed temperatures do not indicate a warming during this time. During transitions, either warming or cooling, chironomid production increases, suggesting an ecosystem-level response to climate variability, seen at a number of lakes across the Arctic.

188,"Mutual climatic range reconstructions of seasonal temperatures based on Late Pleistocene fossil beetle assemblages in Eastern Beringia | The mutual climatic range (MCR) method of paleoclimate reconstruction has been employed by paleoentomologists for the last decade. A quantitative, calibrated method, MCR has many advantages over qualitative methods. The method has now been developed for arctic faunas. Climate envelopes for beetle species found in Eastern Beringia have been compiled using a 25 km gridded North American climate database that pairs climate parameters with modern collection sites. Linear regressions of predicted on observed values yielded equations used to calibrate the MCR estimates. This study presents the initial results from the MCR analysis of 46 fossil beetle assemblages from Alaska and the Yukon Territory. The assemblages range in age from about 150,000-9290 yr BP. Isotope stage six assemblages yielded estimates of mean July temperature (TMAX) 4-5 degreesC colder than at present. Assemblages associated with the Old Crow tephra (OCt) (dated approximately 140,000 yr BP.) likewise indicated TMAX values well below modern levels. Isotope stage 5e faunas showed TMAX values as much as 3.5 degreesC warmer than modern. Early Wisconsinan assemblages showed climatic cooling with TMAX levels dropping as low as 6 degreesC colder than at present. A mid-Wisconsinan interstadial period is marked by warming of mean summer temperatures to near-modern levels at some sites. Last Glacial Maximum assemblages reflect cooling of TMAX to a level about 6.4 degreesC colder than at present, although most assemblages from this period yielded mean January temperatures above modern levels. Warming of summer temperatures began at least by 12,500 yr BP, and warmer-than-modern TMAX values were recorded from all assemblages between then and 9200 yr BP. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

189,"Nitrogen isotope analyses of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), 45,000 BP to 900 BP: Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions | Pleistocene faunal delta N-15 variations are thought to reflect changes in climatic and environmental conditions. Researchers are still unclear, however, which climatic/environmental parameter is the primary control on Pleistocene faunal delta N-15 values. Through extensive nitrogen isotope analysis of Late Pleistocene reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) collagen we investigated whether permafrost development during the Late Pleistocene coincided with changes in delta N-15 values. After 45 ka BP reindeer delta N-15 declined, with lowest delta N-15 values observed after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 15 and 11 ka BP. The decline in delta N-15 appears to be of a greater magnitude in more northern regions than in the South of France, a pattern similar to that previously observed for horse. On a global scale, ecosystem delta N-15 is controlled by the relative openness of the nitrogen cycle, which in turn is controlled by climate. Low soil and plant delta N-15 are observed in cold and/or wet regions and high delta N-15 are seen in hot and/or and areas. The regional pattern in reindeer delta N-15 decline mimics the pattern of climatic deterioration in Europe culminating at the LGM, with climate cooling being more intense in northern Europe than in southern Europe. However, the lowest reindeer delta N-15 values are observed after temperatures started to rise. This may have been due to a lag in the response of the nitrogen cycle to increasing temperatures. Alternatively it may have been linked to the influence of permafrost degradation on soil and plant delta N-15 and thus faunal delta N-15. The renewed climatic cooling during the Younger Dryas did not see a fall in reindeer delta N-15. Limited data does, however, suggest a post Younger Dryas depletion in reindeer delta N-15 values.

190,"Non-linear Holocene climate evolution in the North Atlantic: a high-resolution, multi-proxy record of glacier activity and environmental change from Hvitarvatn, central Iceland | Iceland is well situated to monitor North Atlantic Holocene climate variability. Terrestrial sites there offer the potential for well-dated, high-resolution, continuous records of environmental change and/or glacier activity. Laminated sediments from the proglacial lake Hvitarvatn provide a continuous record of environmental change and the development of the adjacent Langjokull ice cap for the past 10.2 ka. Replicate lake sediment cores, collected from multiple locations in the basin, are placed in a secure geochronology by splicing a varve chronology for the past 3 ka with a tephra-constrained, paleomagnetic secular variation derived chronology for older sediments. Multiple proxies, including sedimentation rate, bulk density, ice-rafted debris, sediment organic matter, biogenic silica, and diatom abundance, allow annual to multi-decadal resolution and reveal a dynamic Holocene terrestrial climate. Following regional deglaciation of the main Iceland Ice Sheet, summer temperatures were high enough that mountain ice caps had already melted, or were contributing insignificant sediment to the lake. Pronounced increases in sedimentation rate, sediment density, and the influx of terrestrial organic matter, between 8.7 and 7.9 ka suggest early Holocene warmth was interrupted by two distinct pulses of cold summers leading to widespread landscape destabilization and possibly glacier growth. The Holocene thermal maximum (HTM; 7.9 to 5.5 ka) was characterized by high within-lake productivity and ice-free conditions in the watershed. Neoglaciation is recorded as a non-linear transition toward cooler summers, landscape destabilization, and the inception and expansion of Langjokull beginning ca 5.5 ka, with notable increases in ice cap size and landscape instability at 4.2 and 3.0 ka. The past two millennia are characterized by the abrupt onset of sustained cold periods at ca 550 and 1250 AD, separated by an interval of relative warmth from ca 950 to 1150 AD. The greatest Holocene extent of Langjokull occurred in the nineteenth century and is coincident with peak landscape instability, followed by ice recession throughout the twentieth century.

191,"Nonlinear response of summer temperature to Holocene insolation forcing in Alaska | Regional climate responses to large-scale forcings, such as precessional changes in solar irradiation and increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases, may be nonlinear as a result of complex interactions among earth system components. Such nonlinear behaviors constitute a major source of climate ""surprises"" with important socioeconomic and ecological implications. Paleorecords are key for elucidating patterns and mechanisms of nonlinear responses to radiative forcing, but their utility has been greatly limited by the paucity of quantitative temperature reconstructions. Here we present Holocene July temperature reconstructions on the basis of midge analysis of sediment cores from three Alaskan lakes. Results show that summer temperatures during 10,0005,500 calibrated years (cal) B.P. were generally lower than modern and that peak summer temperatures around 5,000 were followed by a decreasing trend toward the present. These patterns stand in stark contrast with the trend of precessional insolation, which decreased by similar to 10% from 10,000 y ago to the present. Cool summers before 5,500 cal B.P. coincided with extensive summer ice cover in the western Arctic Ocean, persistence of a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly La Nina-like conditions, and variation in the position of the Alaskan treeline. These results illustrate nonlinear responses of summer temperatures to Holocene insolation radiative forcing in the Alaskan sub-Arctic, possibly because of state changes in the Arctic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation and associated land-atmosphere-ocean feedbacks. | ['clarke', 'clegg', 'hu', 'kelly', 'walker'] | ","['clarke', 'clegg', 'hu', 'kelly', 'walker']",4

193,"A North American Hydroclimate Synthesis (NAHS) of the Common Era | This study presents a synthesis of century-scale hydroclimate variations in North America for the Common Era (last 2000 years) using new age models of previously published multiple proxy-based paleoclimate data. This North American Hydroclimate Synthesis (NAHS) examines regional hydroclimate patterns and related environmental indicators, including vegetation, lake water elevation, stream flow and runoff, cave drip rates, biological productivity, assemblages of living organisms, and salinity. Centennial-scale hydroclimate anomalies are obtained by iteratively sampling the proxy data on each of thousands of age model realizations and determining the fractions of possible time series indicating that the century-smoothed data was anomalously wet or dry relative to the 100 BCE to 1900 CE mean. Results suggest regionally asynchronous wet and dry periods over multidecadal to centennial timescales and frequent periods of extended regional drought. Most sites indicate drying during previously documented multicentennial periods of warmer Northern Hemisphere temperatures, particularly in the western U.S., central U.S., and Canada. Two widespread droughts were documented by the NAHS: from 50 BCE to 450 CE and from 800 to 1100 CE. Major hydroclimate reorganizations occurred out of sync with Northern Hemisphere temperature variations and widespread wet and dry anomalies occurred during both warm and cool periods. We present a broad assessment of paleoclimate relationships that highlights the potential influences of internal variability and external forcing and supports a prominent role for Pacific and Atlantic Ocean dynamics on century-scale continental hydroclimate. | ['christopher', 'claire', 'david', 'debra', 'jason', 'jay', 'jessica', 'john', 'julie', 'katherine', 'kehrwald', 'khan', 'laura', 'lesleigh', 'lynn', 'lysanna', 'michael', 'miriam', 'robert', 'scott', 'steven', 'thomas'] | ","['christopher', 'claire', 'david', 'debra', 'jason', 'jay', 'jessica', 'john', 'julie', 'katherine', 'kehrwald', 'khan', 'laura', 'lesleigh', 'lynn', 'lysanna', 'michael', 'miriam', 'robert', 'scott', 'steven', 'thomas']",4

We have identified three main stages of the delta evolution: estuary erosional (Allerod - 5700 cal BC), lagoon or tidal-marsh (5700 cal BC - 3700 cal BC) and fan-delta accumulative (3700 cal BC - present). These stages are correlated with local climatic curves, sea level changes, glacioisostatic raise curve and Baltic Sea stages. A variety of landforms has been identified and dated within the delta.

Samples included Steller sea lions, Harbor seals, Northern fur seals, sea otters, Pacific cod and sockeye salmon. Sea otters had the highest delta C-13 (-11.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) and lowest delta N-15 values (14.5 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), Northern fur seals had the lowest delta C-13 values (-13.6 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand), and Steller sea lions had the highest delta N-15 values (18.4 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand) of the marine mammals. Cod isotope values were consistent with those of demersal organisms from near shore habitats (-12.5 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand delta C-13, 16.1 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand delta N-15), while salmon values were consistent with those of organisms existing in an open ocean habitat and at a lower trophic level (-15.2 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand d13C, 11.5 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand delta N-15). When comparing six different prehistoric time periods, two time periods had significantly different delta C-13 for salmon. Otters had significantly different delta N-15 values in two out of the six prehistoric time periods but no differences in delta C-13. The mean delta C-13, corrected for the oceanic Suess Effect, of modern specimens of all species (except Northern fur seals) were significantly lower than prehistoric animals. Several hypotheses are explored to explain these differences including a reduction in productivity during the twentieth century in this region of the Gulf of Alaska. If true, this suggests that North Pacific climate regimes experienced during the twentieth century may not be good analogs of North Pacific marine ecosystems during the late Holocene. | ['finney', 'maschner', 'misarti', 'wooller'] | ","['finney', 'maschner', 'misarti', 'wooller']",1

Multivariate statistical analysis of chironomid and environmental data from the combined data set consisting of 268 lakes, located in northern Russia, suggests that mean July air temperature explains the greatest amount of variance in chironomid distribution compared with other measured variables (latitude, longitude, altitude, water depth, lake surface area, pH, conductivity, mean January air temperature, mean July air temperature, and continentality). We established two robust inference models to reconstruct mean summer air temperatures from subfossil chironomids based on ecological and geographical approaches.

197,"Oakes Bay 1: A preliminary reconstruction of a Labrador Inuit seal hunting economy in the context of climate change | This paper presents results of recent archaeological research at the site of Oakes Bay 1 (HeCg-08), on Dog Island, Labrador, dated from the late 17th to late 18th century. Analyses of faunal remains provide a means of reconstructing the site's subsistence economy. The site's inhabitants practiced a very consistent mode of hunting throughout this time period, depending heavily on adult ringed seals taken on the fast ice in winter and spring. Juvenile ringed seals, taken at the ice edge in the spring were a secondary resource. A lack of evidence for the hunting of harp seals in the fall and of ringed seal pups in late spring suggests that the site had a relatively short season of occupation. The consistent pattern of hunting through time suggests that the impacts of climatic variability on Inuit subsistence in the Nain region were relatively limited, moderated by their capacity for mobility on the sea ice rather than by wholescale changes in hunting practices and species choice. The Oakes Bay 1 site presents an example of a different subsistence economy than that seen at other recently examined sites in Labrador, suggesting that the impacts of the so-called Little Ice Age were not global or uniform. | ['woollett'] | ",['woollett'],4

However, shed antlers are common on unglaciated forelands on Hooker, Scot Keltie and Alexandra Land Islands in the archipelago. Radiocarbon dating of 19 new antler remains combined with seven ages reported previously demonstrate the presence of reindeer between c. greater than or equal to 6400 and 1300 cal. BP. Reindeer probably occupied Franz Josef Land for much of the Holocene reflecting sufficient forage associated with summer air temperatures greater than or equal to1 degreesC warmer than today and retracted glaciers and snowfields. A prominent neoglacial advance at c. 1000 cal. BP is coincident with inferred extinction of reindeer.

Vegetation on the initial stage of the peat is characterized by heath vegetation dominated by Ericales indicating cold conditions at 7300-6100 cal yr BP. The appearance of Betula and Alnus is the result of long-distance transportation attributable to strong winds at this time. Sedge-grass (Cyperaceae and Poaceae) communities began replacing heath vegetation at 6100 cal yr BP because of the climatic amelioration. C/N ratios and pollen spectra remain relatively stable at 6100-2450 cal yr BP. For the CR-03 peatland, volcanic tephra contributed significantly to the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectral data. Volcanic input created overlap of an aluminosilicate signal with carbohydrate vibrations. Significant changes occurred at approximately 2450 cal yr BP when there is the some evidence of cooler and wetter conditions of the Neoglacial. High values of delta N-15 observed at 7100-7000 cal yr BP reflect the fertilizing effect of seabird nesting colonies. A decrease in delta N-15 ca. 6900 cal yr BP may indicate initial settlement on Carlisle Island corresponding with harvesting seabirds.

200,"Overview of the oxygen isotope systematics of land snails from North America | Continental paleoclimate proxies with near-global coverage are rare. Land snail delta O-18 is one of the few proxies abundant in Quaternary sediments ranging from the tropics to the high Arctic tundra. However, its application in paleoclimatology remains difficult, attributable in part to limitations in published calibration studies. Here we present shell delta O-18 of modern small (<10 mm) snails across North America, from Florida (30 degrees N) to Manitoba (58 degrees N), to examine the main climatic controls on shell delta O-18 at a coarse scale. This transect is augmented by published delta O-18 values, which expand our coverage from Jamaica (18 degrees N) to Alaska (64 degrees N). Results indicate that shell delta O-18 primarily tracks the average annual precipitation delta O-18. Shell delta O-18 increases 0.5-0.7 parts per thousand for every 1 parts per thousand increase in precipitation delta O-18, and 0.3-0.7 parts per thousand for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature. These relationships hold true when all taxa are included regardless of body size (ranging from 1.6 to 58 mm), ecology (herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores), or behavior (variable seasonal active periods and mobility habits). Future isotopic investigations should include calibration studies in tropical and high-latitude settings, arid environments, and along altitudinal gradients to test if the near linear relationship between shell and meteoric precipitation delta O-18 observed on a continental scale remains significant. | ['al', 'qattan', 'dodd', 'nekola', 'pigati', 'rech', 'yanes'] | ","['al', 'qattan', 'dodd', 'nekola', 'pigati', 'rech', 'yanes']",4
201,"Using a Paired Chironomid delta O-18 and Aquatic Leaf Wax delta H-2 Approach to Reconstruct Seasonality on Western Greenland During the Holocene | The Arctic hydrological cycle is predicted to intensify as the Arctic warms, due to increased poleward moisture transport during summer and increased evaporation from seas once ice-covered during winter. Records of past Arctic precipitation seasonality are important because they provide a context for these ongoing changes. In some Arctic lakes, stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (delta O-18 and delta H-2, respectively) vary seasonally, due to seasonal changes in precipitation delta O-18 and delta H-2. We reconstruct precipitation seasonality from Lake N3, a well-dated lake sediment archive in Disko Bugt, western Greenland, by generating Holocene records of two proxies that are produced at different times of the year, and therefore record different lake water seasonal isotopic compositions. Aquatic plants synthesize waxes throughout the summer, and their delta H-2 reflects winter-biased precipitation delta H-2 at Lake N3, whereas chironomids synthesize their head capsules between late summer and winter, and their delta O-18 reflects summer-biased precipitation delta O-18 at Lake N3. During the middle Holocene at Lake N3, aquatic plant leaf wax was strongly H-2-depleted, while chironomid chitin was O-18-enriched. We guide interpretations of these records using sensitivity tests of a lake water and energy balance model, where we change precipitation amount and isotope seasonality inputs. The sensitivity tests suggest that the contrasting trends between proxies were likely caused by an increase in precipitation amount during all seasons and an increase in precipitation isotope seasonality, in addition to proxy-specific mechanisms, highlighting the importance of understanding lake- and proxy-specific systematics when interpreting records from sediment archives. | ['corcoran', 'morrill', 'thomas'] | ","['corcoran', 'morrill', 'thomas']",1

The plant remains prove that during the last cold-stage arctic species (Minuartia arctica, Draba spp., Kobresia myosuroides) coexisted with aquatic (Potamogeton vaginattts, Callitriche hermaphroditica), littoral (Ranunculus reptans, Rumex maritimus), meadow (Hordetan brevisubulatum, Puccinellia tentriflora) and steppe taxa (Alyssum obovatum, Silene repens, Koeleria cristata, Linum pereune). The reconstructed vegetation composition is similar to modern vegetation mosaics in central and northeast Yakutian relict steppe areas. Thus, productive meadow and steppe communities played an important role in the Siberian Arctic vegetation during the late Pleistocene and could have served as food resource for large populations of herbivores. The floristic composition reflects an extremely continental, arid climate with winters colder and summers distinctly warmer than at present. Holocene macrofossil assemblages indicate a successive paludification possibly connected with marine transgression, increased oceanic influence and atmospheric humidity. Although some steppe taxa were still present in the early Holocene, they disappeared completely before similar to similar to 2900 C-14 yr B.P. (c) 2005 University of Washington.

203,"Palaeoecology of a palsa and a filled thermokarst pond in a permafrost peatland, subarctic Quebec, Canada | Radiocarbon dating and macrofossil data from a palsa and a filled thermokarst pond within a subarctic permafrost peatland were used to reconstruct their evolution and to distinguish between allogenic and autogenic processes that had been involved in their development. Peat began to accumulate in the peatland basin shortly after 6000 cal. BP. The initial stage was a shallow bay or a salty marsh, followed by a wet marsh triggered by a relatively rapid drop in sea level related to a rapid isostatic uplift of land. By 5640 cal. BP, the site had transformed into a rich fen. A high rate of peat accumulation led to the establishment of a short-lived intermediate fen by 4610 cal. BP and to a poor fen from 4200 cal. BP until 1760 cal. BP. Low water-tables associated with decreased precipitation occurred between 5170 and 4610 cal. BP, and 3100 and 1760 cal. BP. Between 1760 and the Little Ice Age, there was ombrotrophication of the site largely as a result of a thick peat accumulation. During this period, autogenic processes had controlled the general hydrosere, while allogenic processes, mainly precipitation, had influenced species composition. Permafrost established during the Little Ice Age leading to palsa formation and it has been melting in response to recent climate warming and precipitation increases. Macrofossil results from the filled thermokarst pond show that plant succession used the followed hydrosere: Calliergon giganteum and Sphagnum riparium when the pond's depth was at a maximum, S. riparium and C. giganteum when the pond was partly filled in, and S. lindbergii and S. riparium since the pond has been completely filled in. | ['arlen', 'pouliot', 'bhiry'] | ","['arlen', 'pouliot', 'bhiry']",1

Here, we present the results of combined paleo-proxy studies including pollen, chironomid, diatom and mammal fossil analyses from a prominent Yedoma cliff on Sobo-Sise Island in the eastern Lena Delta, NE Siberia to complement previous and ongoing paleo-ecological research in western Beringia. The Yedoma Ice Complex (IC) cliff on Sobo-Sise Island (up to 28 m high, 1.7 km long) was continuously sampled at 0.5 m resolution. The entire sequence covers the last about 52 cal kyr BP, but is not continuous as it shows substantial hiatuses at 36-29 cal kyr BP, at 20-17 cal kyr BP and at 15-7 cal kyr BP. The Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 Yedoma IC (52-28 cal kyr BP) pollen spectra show typical features of tundra-steppe vegetation. Green algae remains indicate freshwater conditions. The chironomid assemblages vary considerably in abundance and diversity. Chironomid-based T-July reconstructions during MIS 3 reveal warmer-than-today T-July at about 51 cal kyr BP, 46-44 and 41 cal kyr BP. The MIS 2 Yedoma IC (28-15 cal kyr BP) pollen spectra represent tundra-steppe vegetation as during MIS 3, but higher abundance of Artemisia and lower abundances of algae remains indicate drier summer conditions. The chironomid records are poor. The MIS 1 (7-0 cal kyr BP) pollen spectra indicate shrub-tundra vegetation. The chironomid fauna is sparse and not diverse. The chironomid-based T-July reconstruction supports similar-as-today temperatures at 6.4-4.4 cal kyr BP. Diatoms were recorded only after about 6.4 cal kyr BP. The Sobo-Sise Yedoma record preserves traces of the West Beringian tundra-steppe that maintained the Mammoth fauna including rare evidence for woolly rhinoceros' presence. Chironomid-based T-July reconstructions complement previous plant-macrofossil based T-July of regional MIS 3 records.

Indeed, current conditions in the lake during the last 30 years are unprecedented in the context of the last 1450 years. The dominant driver for recent changes is likely an intensification of agricultural practices combined with warming summer temperatures. Warm temperatures and agricultural disturbance together during Norse Landnam did not lead to the marked changes seen in the modern lake environment over the last 30 years. The synergistic response between increased climate warming and agriculture will likely have unanticipated effects. These findings confirm the sensitivity of Arctic lakes to external anthropogenic forcing and are the first analyses of their kind for the effects of agriculture in Greenland. | ['bichet', 'gauthier', 'massa', 'mathieu', 'perren', 'petit', 'richard'] | ","['bichet', 'gauthier', 'massa', 'mathieu', 'perren', 'petit', 'richard']",4
206,"Paleoecological perspectives on landscape history and anthropogenic impacts at Uivak Point, Labrador, since AD 1400 | Archaeological and paleoecological investigations were undertaken at Uivak Point (HjCl-09 located in Okak Bay, Labrador), a site that consists of a winter village comprising the ruins of nine sod houses and a number of tent ring, cache, and other structures. The site was occupied during the late 18th to early 19th centuries, although the immediate area has been used by many cultural groups spanning from Labrador's early prehistory into the 20th century. Between ca. 3030 and ca. 710cal. yr BP, cold and dry climate conditions corresponding to the late Neoglacial period generated the abundance of shrub tundra. From ca. 710 to ca. 550cal. yr BP, conditions became warmer and wetter, triggering the expansion of trees. Since ca. 550cal. yr BP, there has been an abundance of dry taxa which may reflect the colder conditions of the Little Ice Age'. Subsequent climate warming has allowed the re-expansion of trees and shrubs over the last 200years. Moreover, our results indicate that the Thule/Inuit harvested many plant species that grew in the vicinity of Uivak Point for food, raw material, and fuel. For example, many anthropogenic remains (burnt fat, burnt moss leaves, and charcoal) were incorporated into the soil. These activities also triggered the establishment of some weeds and apophytes (Montia Fontana and Silene). Furthermore, our chronostratigraphical and paleoecological data suggest that the site was occupied on an irregular basis since approximately AD 1400. | ['bhiry', 'roy', 'woollett'] | ","['bhiry', 'roy', 'woollett']",1

The insect fossils are indicative of arctic coastal habitats like those of the Mackenzie Delta region (mean July temperatures = 10.6-14 degree C) suggesting that 11,000 yr ago the exposed Chukchi Sea shelf had a climate substantially warmer than modern coastal regions of the Alaskan north slope.

209,"Holocene Paleohydrology of Central Alberta Canada Testing the General-Circulation-Model Climate Simulations | Paleoecological investigations of 28 lakes and bogs provide the basis for a Holocene paleohydrological record for central Alberta. Shallow basins, empty during the early Holocene, began flooding shortly after 8000 years ago; most filled from 6500 to 4500 years ago, and none filled later than 3000 years ago. Pollen of a hypersaline indicator genus, Ruppia, was found in cores of lakes where the plant does not presently grow, indicating lower lake levels, evaporation stress, and increased salinity from 8000 to 3000 years ago. Moore Lake (54.degree.30'N, 100.degree.30'W) may have dropped 15 m from 9200 to 5900 years ago, and Lofty Lake (54.degree.44'N, 112.degree.29'W) largely dried up between 8700 and 6300 years ago. Lower water levels are suggested for several lakes by shifts in fossil diatom populations from planktonic to benthic, particularly epipelic species including pioneering taxa. These shallow, warm lakes were highly productive and sedimentary pigment levels reached maximum values between about 9000 and 4000 years ago. The paleohydrological record indicates early Holocene aridity, with the onset and development of moister conditions between 8000 and 3000 years ago, by which time modern climatic and vegetation conditions had been established. This record fits the Holocene climate predicted by the general-circulation-model simulations based on orbital perturbations. | ['hickman', 'schweger'] | ","['hickman', 'schweger']",2
210,"Holocene paleohydrology and paleoclimate at treeline, north-central Russia, inferred from oxygen isotope records in lake sediment cellulose | Lake-water oxygen-isotope histories for three lakes in northern Russia, derived from the cellulose oxygen-isotope stratigraphies of sediment cores, provide the basis for preliminary reconstruction of Holocene paleohydrology in two regions along the boreal treeline, Deconvolution of shifting precipitation delta(18)O from secondary evaporative isotopic enrichment is aided by knowledge of the distribution of isotopes in modern precipitation, the isotopic composition of paleo-waters preserved in frozen peat deposits, as well as other supporting paleoclimatic information. These data indicate that during the early Holocene, when the boreal treeline advanced to the current arctic coastline, conditions in the lower Yenisey River region were moist compared to the present, whereas greater aridity prevailed to the east near the lower Lena River. This longitudinal moisture gradient is consistent with the suggestion that oceanic forcing (increased sea-surface temperatures in the Nordic Seas and reduced sea-ice cover) was a major contributor to the development of a more maritime climate in western Eurasia, in addition to increased summer insolation. East of the Taimyr Peninsula, large tracts of the continental shelf exposed by glacial sea-level drawdown may have suppressed maritime climatic influence in what are now coastal areas, In contrast, during the late Holocene the two regions have apparently experienced coherent shifts in effective moisture. The similarity of the records may primarily reflect reduced North Atlantic influence in the Nordic Seas and southward retreat of coastline in eastern Siberia, coupled with declining summer insolation, (C) 2000 University of Washington. | ['aravena', 'edward', 'forman', 'macdonald', 'velichko', 'warner', 'wolfe'] | ","['aravena', 'edward', 'forman', 'macdonald', 'velichko', 'warner', 'wolfe']",1
211,"Paleolimnological reconstructions of holocene environments and climate from Lake Lyadhej-To, Ural Mountains, Northern Russia | A sediment core recovered in Lake Lyadhej-To at the northwestern edge of the Ural Mountains reflects the complete Holocene environmental history from apprx11,000 cal. yr B.P. Five limnological episodes are identified in the diatom and geochemical records. The initial lake stage, Episode I (apprx11,000-10,850 cal. yr B.P.) is characterized by the absence of biogenic production and a high influx of clastic sediments. Episode H (apprx10,850-8650 cal. yr B.P.) is characterized by ice-free conditions during summer, highest bioproductivity, strong growth of planktic diatoms and anoxic bottom waters. This period represents the Holocene climatic optimum. Deterioration of climatic conditions commenced in Episode III (apprx8650-7000 cal. yr B.P.) as indicated by distinctly lower bioproductivity and longer persistence of winter ice on the lake. During Episode IV (apprx7000-2500 cal. yr B.P.), the diatom and pollen records indicate that temperatures were cool and the growing season was short. Finally, in Episode V (apprx2500 cal. yr B.P. to present), limnological conditions, indicated by increased organic carbon and diatom deposition, initially suggest improved conditions followed by a return to modem conditions beginning apprx500 cal. yr B.P. The pollen stratigraphy from Lake Lyadhej-To is consistent with other paleoclimatic records from northern Eurasia, confirming rapid postglacial warming, the presence of dense tree forests during the climatic optimum, and finally a gradual southward retreat of the treeline towards its modem location. | ['andreev', 'cremer', 'hubberten', 'wischer'] | ","['andreev', 'cremer', 'hubberten', 'wischer']",3

213,"Palynological evidence of climatic and oceanographic changes in the North Sea during the last deglaciation | Palynological analyses performed on cores from the Norwegian Channel (Troll 8903) led to reconstruction of the late-glacial variations in sea-surface conditions using dinoflagellate cyst data and permitted direct correlation with the vegetation history of northwestern Europe derived from pollen assemblages. By apprx15,000 yr B.P., ice rapidly receded from the Norwegian shelf and relatively warm summer conditions prevailed in surface waters. A first late-glacial cooling marked by extensive seasonal sea-ice cover is dated at ca. 13,600-13,000 14C yr B.P., which coincides with the Oldest Dryas interval. During the Bolling-Allerod interval, a rise in sea-surface temperature both in February (up to 3degree C) and August (up to 15degree C) led to the establishment of ice-free conditions in the northern North Sea, while pollen data reveal a densification of the vegetation cover. The beginning of the Younger Dryas interval is marked by an increase in nonarboreal pollen input indicative of the opening of the forest vegetation cover, concomitant with a cooling of surface waters during winter and development of sea-ice cover. However, sea-surface conditions remained relatively warm in summer until about 10,300 yr B.P., when extremely cold conditions and extensive sea-ice cover developed (up to 7 months/yr). Improving conditions are recorded in surface waters by apprx10,100 yr B.P., a few hundred years before the development of forest cover onshore, as shown by the pollen record. Such a discrepancy between marine and terrestrial indicators at the end of Younger Dryas time suggests a delayed response of the vegetation to regional climate warming. | ['de', 'vernal', 'haflidason', 'rochon', 'sejrup'] | ","['de', 'vernal', 'haflidason', 'rochon', 'sejrup']",4

215,"A Pollen Record from the Agassiz Ice Cap Northern Ellesmere Island Canada | A continuous pollen record from the last glacial period to 100 B.P. was obtained from an ice core drilled in 1977 near the top of the Agassiz Ice Cap. Pollen concentrations are low (c. 15-173 grains/100 l) throughout the core and exotic pollen grains (from distant sources) dominate over regional pollen grains (from Ellesmere Island). The very low concentrations during the Wisconsinan glacial period and the early Holocene are attributed to the increased distance of potential sources as most of northern North America was ice-covered or supported tundra vegetation. An increase of exotic grains (mainly birch and alder) at c. 7,600 B.P. corresponds to the period of alder migration into the Low Arctic regions. The subsequent fluctuations of exotic pollen, especially the increase at c. 3,100 B.P., are unexplained at present. Regional pollen concentrations start to increase at c. 6,100 B.P. and a maximum concentration is reached at c. 3,100 B.P. The pollen record suggests that plant migration into northern Ellesmere was limited until 6,100 B.P., then increased gradually and continued to do so for about 1,000 years after the climate had started to deteriorate at about 4,000 B.P. | ['bourgeois'] | ",['bourgeois'],3
216,"A pollen-climate transfer function from the tundra and taiga vegetation in Arctic Siberia and its applicability to a Holocene record | This study aims to establish, evaluate, and apply a modern pollen-climate transfer function from the transition zone between arctic tundra and light-needled taiga in Arctic Siberia. Lacustrine samples (n = 96) from the northern Siberian lowlands of Yakutia were collected along four north-to-south transects crossing the arctic forest line. Samples span a broad temperature and precipitation gradient (mean July temperature, T-July: 7.5-18.7 degrees C; mean annual precipitation, P-ann: 114-315 mm/yr). Redundancy analyses are used to examine the relationship between the modern pollen signal and corresponding vegetation types and climate. Performance of transfer functions for T-July and P-ann were cross-validated and tested for spatial autocorrelation effects. The root mean square errors of prediction are 1.67 degrees C for T-July and 40 mm/yr for P-ann. A climate reconstruction based on fossil pollen spectra from a Siberian Arctic lake sediment core spanning the Holocene yielded cold conditions for the Late Glacial (1-2 degrees C below present T-July). Warm and moist conditions were reconstructed for the early to mid Holocene (2 degrees C higher T-July than present), and climate conditions similar to modern ones were reconstructed for the last 4000 years. In conclusion, our modern pollen data set fills the gap of existing regional calibration sets with regard to the underrepresented Siberian tundra-taiga transition zone. The Holocene climate reconstruction indicates that the temperature deviation from modern values was only moderate despite the assumed Arctic sensitivity to present climate change.

Local changes in vegetation and environment are deduced from palynology, lithology, and chronology; possible regional climatic changes are discussed. The main results are as follows: (1) ca. 4400-ca. 2450 BP: the wetness of the peat-forming vegetation increased in three phases, possibly due to cooling of the climate. (2) ca. 2450-ca. 800 BP: the peat-forming vegetation was dry, probably due to formation of erosion gullies at ca. 2450 BP.

218,"From pollen percentage to regional vegetation cover - A new insight into cultural landscape development in western Norway | The REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites) model was applied to a pollen dataset from a large lake in western Norway to reconstruct the vegetation cover throughout the last c. 11,400 years. The reconstructions, based on 18 common taxa, show development of a forested landscape until c. 5600 cal yr BP, followed by several phases of opening and reforestation, probably connected to variation in the intensity and type of human impact. From c. 5600 cal yr BP (Early Neolithic) to c. 3200 cal yr BP (Early Bronze Age), a general increase in openness takes place, with increased deforestation c. 4300 and 4000 cal yr BP. More extensive forest clearances are seen at 2750 cal yr BP (Late Bronze Age) and 1800 cal yr BP (Roman Iron Age). Reforestation is recognised at c. 5400, 4100, 3600, 2900, 1900, 1200, 700 and 300 cal yr BP. Calluna is present in the vegetation both in the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, and heathland expansion is inferred to take place in the Late Bronze Age, with further expansion c. 1800 and 950 cal yr BP, probably reflecting increased use of outfield resources at the expense of grasslands. Forest disturbance and grazing are inferred to have taken place from 5600 cal yr BP, and communities comparable to historical time periods have existed from 2750 cal yr BP. An expansion in the area used for cereal cultivation probably took place in the Roman Iron Age. In the last century, from c. 1920, an expansion of conifers takes place, and Picea shows a strong increase during the last twenty years. Changes in both forest composition and land-cover are more clearly reflected with the REVEALS model than from the pollen percentage diagram, and the probability of presence of taxa within the region is demonstrated. REVEALS modelling combined with archaeological data is recommended as an approach to gain increased knowledge about land-cover changes through time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

219,"Polynyas and ice edge habitats in cultural context: archaeological perspectives from southeast Baffin Island | A combination of paleoclimatic proxies, zooarchaeological data from historic Inuit habitation sites, and Geographic Information System (GIS) studies of modem sea-ice extremes were used to track the changing size and shape in modem times of a polynya situated in outer Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island. From these data, inferences were drawn about historic Inuit settlement patterns and subsistence strategies in the region over the last 500 years. Results of the analysis show that during episodes of cooling temperatures and increased ice severity, the polynya decreases in size and is more localized in outer Frobisher Bay. During warmer periods, the polynya increases in size. extending its ice edge habitat significantly towards the head of Frobisher Bay. These findings, as well as zooarchaeological studies from the outer Bay region that show extensive use of the floe edge habitat, suggest that the present-day polynya was an important factor in attracting various migrations of people to this area, beginning as early as the 14th century. The polynya represented not only a predictable food source on which Inuit could depend during periods of high climatic variability, but also a reliable economic base that allowed them to maintain a high degree of autonomy throughout the different phases of European contact history. The findings discussed in this study are presented at two spatial scales in order to draw connections between regional patterns of sea-ice distribution and Inuit settlement and more local patterns of human response and adaptation. | ['henshaw'] | ",['henshaw'],1

222,"Post-glacial lake development and paleoclimate in the central Hudson Bay Lowlands inferred from sediment records | We compile a multi-proxy Holocene record from North Raft Lake located in the sub-Arctic Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada. Specifically, we use subfossil chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, non-pollen palynomorphs, sedimentary chlorophyll a, magnetic susceptibility, and organic matter content to characterize terrestrial and lake processes and to track paleoclimate following land emergence from the postglacial Tyrrell Sea. Following recession of the Tyrrell Sea (similar to 6600 cal yr BP), pollen assemblages are indicative of a salt marsh environment with the establishment of an opportunistic chironomid assemblage. By similar to 6200 cal yr BP, isostatic uplift reduced the marine influence and pollen and palynomorph assemblage changes indicate that North Raft Lake became a closed-basin freshwater system. At this time, pollen assemblages signify the establishment of a forested peatland dominated by Picea, and chironomid taxa indicate warming water temperatures. The North Raft Lake pollen/palynomorph record captures a warm and moist mid-Holocene (Holocene Thermal Maximum) period starting similar to 6200 cal yr BP. During this period, an increase in pollen concentration and a shift to higher abundances of Larix indicate watershed-scale succession and enhanced local ecosystem productivity. Shifts in chironomid taxa at similar to 5000 cal yr BP are indicative of abrupt limnological changes suggesting wet conditions that caused an expansion of littoral habitat. The gradual transition into Neoglacial cooling is signaled by an increase in the abundances of cold-stenothermal chironomid taxa and a small decline in pollen-reconstructed temperatures. Marked changes occur in the mid-twentieth century with the appearance of diatoms in notable abundances for the first time in the lake's sedimentary record, the arrival of new chironomid littoral taxa, and unprecedented increases in sedimentary chlorophyll a and organic matter content. Throughout the North Raft Lake Holocene sediment record, the pollen trends suggest slow centennial-scale changes in temperature and precipitation, whereas chironomid assemblages indicate abrupt mid-Holocene and twentieth century limnological changes, stressing that biota in lakes of the Hudson Bay Lowlands may change substantially under future scenarios of global climate warming. | ['dalton', 'finkelstein', 'hargan', 'keller', 'packalen', 'paterson', 'ruhland', 'smol'] | ","['dalton', 'finkelstein', 'hargan', 'keller', 'packalen', 'paterson', 'ruhland', 'smol']",4

The pollen spectra indicate herbaceous tundra existed on the landscape from 13.6-11 ka followed by birch shrub tundra until 10 ka. Although Picea pollen dominated the assemblages after 10 ka, low pollen accumulation rates and Picea percentages indicate minimal treeline movement through the Holocene. Chironomid accumulation rates provide evidence of millennial-scale climate variability, and the chironomid community responded to rapid climate changes. Ostracodes were found in the late glacial and early Holocene, but disappeared due to chemical changes of the lake associated with changes in vegetation on the landscape. Inferred mean July air temperature, total annual precipitation, and water depth indicate a long-term cooling with increasing moisture from the late glacial through the Holocene. During the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.2 ka), cold and dry conditions prevailed.

224,"Postglacial emergence of western Franz Josef Land, Russia, and retreat of the Barents Sea ice sheet | Uncertainty remains on the timing and extent of Late Weichselian glaciers over the Barents and Kara sea shelves. Franz Josef Land, Russia, is a critical area for deciphering the record of glacier fluctuations and postglacial relative sea-level change. Coastal forelands on the archipelago are covered by a well-preserved raised-beach sequence containing abundant and pristine-driftwood, whalebone, and shell. C-14 dating of these materials provides site-specific emergence records for the archipelago, and some of the oldest ages on deglaciation of 10,400 BP. Three apparent still-stands in emergence are inferred from morphology of the raised-beach sequence ana C-14 dating between 9900 and 6200 BP, and at ca. 5500 BP and 3500 BP. The earliest sea-level arrest, after formation of the marine limit, reflects a balance between glacio-isostasy and eustasy, concomitant with the final phase of global sea-level rise. The latter two sea level arrests during the middle- to late-Holocene are less pronounced and may indicate increased height of the ocean surface with greater storminess and extended open-water conditions. Raised beaches at 1-2 m a.s.l, and C-14 dated at 1000 to 2000 BP give contemporary emergence rates of 1 to 2 mm/year. The low current rates of emergence on Franz Josef Land are similar to areas in Fennoscandinavia that sustained modest Late-Weichselian glacier loads (<1500 m), within a few 100s of km of the inferred ice sheet margin. The pattern of postglacial emergence and strandline tilts indicates that past glacier loads were greater over the adjacent Barents Sea, than Franz Josef Land. Marine and terrestrial records from Franz Josef Land place retreat of glaciers from coastal areas by 10,400 BP, whereas the adjacent Franz Victoria Trough was deglaciated by 13,000 BP. Retreat of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet was probably underway by 13,500 BP, coincident with rising global sea-level and elevated summer insolation. We infer that iceberg calving through the deep troughs bordering the Barents Sea, particularly with rapidly rising sea level ca. 12,000 BP was an important process controlling the demise of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet.

225,"Postglacial palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Fury and Hecla Strait region (Nunavut) inferred from microfossils and geochemical proxies | An analysis of sediment records from two lakes located along the southeastern shore of the Fury and Hecla Strait (Nunavut, Canada) allowed us to reconstruct the regional environmental history since deglaciation. Multiproxy profiles, namely particle-size distribution, elemental geochemistry (based on X-ray fluorescence) and diatom assemblages, revealed a regional deglaciation and marine inundation around 8200 cal a bp. This suggests that glacial retreat in this region likely occurred several hundred years earlier than previously extrapolated. At that time, the connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean currents must have been established and glacial isostatic adjustment gradually isolated the lacustrine basins from marine influence. Diatom assemblages revealed an abrupt marine-brackish-freshwater transition (ca. 6670-6130 cal a bp) through a shift in dominance from initial polyhalobian (e.g. Tabularia fasciculata, Navicula directa), intermediate mesohalobian (e.g. Cyclostephanos dubius, Thalassiosira baltica) to oligohalobian (fragilarioid Staurosirella pinnata, Staurosira venter, Pseudostaurosira pseudoconstruens, P. brevistriata) taxa. Multivariate analyses (redundancy analysis and multivariate regression tree) conducted on the biological and lithogeochemical data also suggest that climatic conditions may have remained relatively warm throughout the interval similar to 6000-3900 cal a bp, before significantly cooling over the past few millennia, as inferred from a decrease in organic matter accumulation and shifts in diatom communities. | ['adaime', 'antoniades', 'legendre', 'pienitz'] | ","['adaime', 'antoniades', 'legendre', 'pienitz']",4

However, the occurrence of Abies, which reached a maximum abundance at ca. 7000-6000 BP, and increasing percentages of Alnus indicate northward tree migration and development of shrub tundra as a result of warmer terrestrial conditions. Around 6000 BP, the significant occurrence of Peridinium faeroense and Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus suggests the establishment of modern-like conditions in surface waters. This transition coincides with an abrupt increase in the abundance of Picea, associated with the regional development of spruce Forests. The later marine record does not indicate any significant trend in sea-surface temperature, whereas decreasing abundance of arboreal pollen reflects opening of the forest cover in response to a slight cooling onshore. Thus, palynological analyses suggest complex changes in continental climate and marine hydrography along the coast of Labrador. | ['levac', 'de', 'vernal'] | ","['levac', 'de', 'vernal']",4
227,"Potential analogues for paleoclimatic variations in eastern interior Alaska during the past 14,000 yr: atmospheric-circulation controls of regional temperature and moisture responses | The paleoclimatic history of a region can be viewed as a series of surface temperature and moisture anomalies through time. The effects of changes in large-scale climatic controls (e.g., insolation, major circulation controls) can be mediated by the influence of smaller-scale controls (e.g., topographic barriers, coastlines); this may result in heterogenous surface climatic responses at the regional and sub-regional scale. Divergent paleoclimatic trajectories between regions may be explainable in terms of such meso-scale patterns. Using modern analogues for paleoclimate we examine how the sequence of climatic variations in eastern interior Alaska during the interval 12,000-0 C-14 yr BP could have been generated by specific atmospheric circulation patterns. Fossil-pollen and lake-level records document the long-term trends in temperature and effective moisture for the region. Water-balance modelling provides additional estimates of paleoprecipitation. Synoptic climatological patterns are described using the modern (instrumental) record of upper-level and sea-level pressure, surface temperature, and precipitation. At 12,000 C-14 yr BP, eastern interior Alaska was cooler and drier than present, a situation generated today by a southward displacement of the jet stream. Conditions warmer and drier than present at 9000 C-14 yr BP may have been generated by increased ridging north of Alaska and a weakened westerly circulation. Warmer, wetter conditions than present possibly prevailed in the late-middle Holocene; these might reflect ridging over Alaska and troughing further west. Cool, wet conditions feature enhanced westerly flow into Alaska through an eastward shift in the east Asian trough and positive pressure anomalies in the North Pacific; they may be analogous to cold periods of the Little Ice Age. The analogues demonstrate how surface conditions in other parts of Beringia may sometimes be similar to, while at other times different from those in the eastern interior. These broader spatial patterns provide hypotheses about past climates that can be tested with paleoclimatological data. For example, the widespread positive temperature anomalies associated with the warm/dry (9000 C-14 yr BP) analogue fit with the expansion northward of the eastern Siberian treeline. The anomalously cool conditions in northeast Siberia associated with the warm/wet analogue may explain the continued (late-middle Holocene) treeline advance in Alaska while there was retreat in Siberia.

228,"The potential of sedimentary ancient DNA for reconstructing past sea ice evolution | Sea ice is a crucial component of the Arctic climate system, yet the tools to document the evolution of sea ice conditions on historical and geological time scales are few and have limitations. Such records are essential for documenting and understanding the natural variations in Arctic sea ice extent. Here we explore sedimentary ancient DNA (aDNA), as a novel tool that unlocks and exploits the genetic (eukaryote) biodiversity preserved in marine sediments specifically for past sea ice reconstructions. Although use of sedimentary aDNA in paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies is still in its infancy, we use here metabarcoding and single-species quantitative DNA detection methods to document the sea ice conditions in a Greenland Sea marine sediment core. Metabarcoding has allowed identifying biodiversity changes in the geological record back to almost similar to 100,000 years ago that were related to changing sea ice conditions. Detailed bioinformatic analyses on the metabarcoding data revealed several sea-ice-associated taxa, most of which previously unknown from the fossil record. Finally, we quantitatively traced one known sea ice dinoflagellate in the sediment core. We show that aDNA can be recovered from deep-ocean sediments with generally oxic bottom waters and that past sea ice conditions can be documented beyond instrumental time scales. Our results corroborate sea ice reconstructions made by traditional tools, and thus demonstrate the potential of sedimentary aDNA, focusing primarily on microbial eukaryotes, as a new tool to better understand sea ice evolution in the climate system. | ['de', 'schepper', 'ijaz', 'larsen', 'ray', 'sadatzki', 'skaar', 'stein'] | ","['de', 'schepper', 'ijaz', 'larsen', 'ray', 'sadatzki', 'skaar', 'stein']",3
229,"Precise date for the Laacher See eruption synchronizes the Younger Dryas | A revised date for the Laacher See eruption using measurements of subfossil trees shifts the chronology of European varved lakes relative to the Greenland ice core record, synchronizing the onset of the Younger Dryas across the North Atlantic-European sector. The Laacher See eruption (LSE) in Germany ranks among Europe's largest volcanic events of the Upper Pleistocene(1,2). Although tephra deposits of the LSE represent an important isochron for the synchronization of proxy archives at the Late Glacial to Early Holocene transition(3), uncertainty in the age of the eruption has prevailed(4). Here we present dendrochronological and radiocarbon measurements of subfossil trees that were buried by pyroclastic deposits that firmly date the LSE to 13,006 +/- 9 calibrated years before present (bp; taken as ad 1950), which is more than a century earlier than previously accepted. The revised age of the LSE necessarily shifts the chronology of European varved lakes(5,6) relative to the Greenland ice core record, thereby dating the onset of the Younger Dryas to 12,807 +/- 12 calibrated years bp, which is around 130 years earlier than thought. Our results synchronize the onset of the Younger Dryas across the North Atlantic-European sector, preclude a direct link between the LSE and Greenland Stadial-1 cooling(7), and suggest a large-scale common mechanism of a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation under warming conditions(8-10). | ['adolphi', 'buntgen', 'cherubini', 'engels', 'esper', 'guidobaldi', 'joris', 'land', 'lane', 'nievergelt', 'oppenheimer', 'pfanz', 'reinig', 'remmele', 'sigl', 'sookdeo', 'wacker'] | ","['adolphi', 'buntgen', 'cherubini', 'engels', 'esper', 'guidobaldi', 'joris', 'land', 'lane', 'nievergelt', 'oppenheimer', 'pfanz', 'reinig', 'remmele', 'sigl', 'sookdeo', 'wacker']",2
230,"Quantifying Recent Ecological Changes in Remote Lakes of North America and Greenland Using Sediment Diatom Assemblages | Background: Although arctic lakes have responded sensitively to 20(th)-century climate change, it remains uncertain how these ecological transformations compare with alpine and montane-boreal counterparts over the same interval. Furthermore, it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr), have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote lake ecosystems.Methodology/Principal Findings: We synthesized 52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems. Diatom compositional turnover (beta-diversity) during the 20(th) century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19(th) century and the prior similar to 250 years (Little Ice Age). For both arctic and alpine lakes, beta-diversity during the 20(th) century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years, and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no correlation is apparent between 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH, conductivity, [NO3-], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends 1948-2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to lake pH, lake: catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and recent temperature trends.Conclusions/Significance: The ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal concentrations of sites with elevated 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene, particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to intersect geographically. | ['birks', 'hazewinkel', 'hobbs', 'perren', 'saros', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'telford', 'wolfe'] | ","['birks', 'hazewinkel', 'hobbs', 'perren', 'saros', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'telford', 'wolfe']",1
231,"Quantitative calibration of remote mountain-lake sediments as climatic recorders of air temperature and ice-cover duration | A combination of empirical modeling and a diatom-based transfer function was developed to reconstruct air temperature and ice-cover duration through the study of lake sediments. By using a thermal degree-day modeling approach, ice-cover duration on European mountain and sub-Arctic lakes is found to be very sensitive to temperature change. For example, Our model, which incorporates a weather generator, predicts a 100-day shortening in ice-cover duration for a 3 degrees C temperature rise for catchments at elevations of 1500 in in the Southern Alps and the Pyrenees. For the more maritime takes of Scotland., 30% higher sensitivities (130 d per 3 degrees C) are found, whereas lakes in northwest Finland, in a more continental setting, have only half the sensitivity (50 d per 3 degrees C). A pan-European data set of the species abundance of 252 diatom taxa in 459 mountain and sub-Arctic lakes has been compiled and taxonomically harmonized. Transfer functions were created that relate both seasonal air temperature and ice-cover duration to diatom species composition on the basis of a weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) approach. Cross validation was used to test the transfer functions. For ice-cover duration the pan-European data set yields an R-squared value of 0.73, a jack-knifed R-squared value of 0.58, and a residual-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 23 days. A regional, northern Fennoscandian transect (151 lakes, 122 taxa) yields a jack-knifed R-squared value of 0.50 and an RMSEP of 9 days. For air temperature the pan-European database displayed temperatures. This result contrasts with greatest skill when reconstructing winter or spring the summer temperatures normally Studied when using local elevation gradients. The northern Fennoscandian transect has a remarkably low winter RMSEP of 0.73 degrees C. | ['bigler', 'cameron', 'catalan', 'garcia', 'hall', 'jones', 'korhola', 'price', 'rosen', 'thompson', 'weckstrom'] | ","['bigler', 'cameron', 'catalan', 'garcia', 'hall', 'jones', 'korhola', 'price', 'rosen', 'thompson', 'weckstrom']",4
232,"Quantitative paleotemperature estimates from delta18O of chironomid head capsules preserved in arctic lake sediments | A paleoenvironmental perspective of temperature change is paramount to understanding the significance of recent warming in the Arctic. Late Quaternary sediments from many arctic lakes provide environmental archives with decadal resolution, but reconstructions are hampered by the relative insensitivity of many traditional proxies to temperature. Here, we show that the delta18O of head capsules of chironomid larvae are equilibrated with the delta18O of lakewaters in which they live. In suitable lakes, lakewater delta18O is controlled by the delta18O of local precipitation, which is strongly correlated to mean annual air temperature ( MAT). From this correlation, chironomid delta18O can be used to examine past changes in MAT. We illustrate the potential of this novel approach to paleothermometry with examples from two arctic lakes that reveal strong regional paleoclimatic gradients in the early Holocene. | ['fogel', 'francis', 'miller', 'walker', 'wolfe', 'wooller'] | ","['fogel', 'francis', 'miller', 'walker', 'wolfe', 'wooller']",4
233,"Quantitative summer-temperature reconstructions for the last 2000 years based on pollen-stratigraphical data from northern Fennoscandia | Quantitative reconstructions of mean July temperatures (T (jul)) based on new and previously published pollen-stratigraphical data covering the last 2000 years from 11 lakes in northern Fennoscandia and the Kola Peninsula are presented. T (jul) values are based on a previously published pollen-climate transfer function for the region with a root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.99A degrees C. The most obvious trend in the inferred temperatures from all sites is the general decrease in T (jul) during the last 2000 years. Pollen-inferred T (jul) values on average 0.18 +/- A 0.56A degrees C (n = 91) higher than present (where ""present"" refers to the last three decades based on pollen-inferred T (jul) in core-top samples) are indicated between 0 and 1100 AD (2000-850 cal year BP), and temperatures -0.2 +/- A 0.47A degrees C (n = 78) below present are inferred between 1100 and 1900 AD (850-50 cal year BP). No consistent temperature peak is observed during the 'Medieval Warm Period', ca. 900-1200 AD (1100-750 cal year BP), but the cooler period between 1100 and 1900 AD (850-50 cal year BP) corresponds in general with the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). Consistently with independent stable isotopic data, the composite pollen-based record suggests that the coldest periods of the LIA date to 1500-1600 AD (450-350 cal year BP) and 1800-1850 AD (150-100 cal year BP). An abrupt warming occurred at about 1900 AD and the twentieth century is the warmest century since about 1000 AD (950 cal year BP). | ['birks', 'bjune', 'seppa'] | ","['birks', 'bjune', 'seppa']",2

The prevalences of R. campanula and R. fennica in Lake Saravesi, central Finland, during 1987 to 1989 were 1.0 and 33.2% (n = 1157), respectively. No clear seasonality in prevalence was found in either species, although miracidia of these digeneans are present only in late summer and autumn. The proportion of infected clams in which the gonad was full of sporocyst tubules was on average 90% for R. campanula and 30% for R. fennica. Clams with only few sporocyst tubules in their gonad were observed most frequently in spring. Old, empty sporocyst ribbons of R. fennica first appeared in the clams during August after the beginning of the cercarial emergence and disappeared slowly thereafter. However, in both species viable sporocyst ribbons with early developmental stages of cercariae were found throughout the year. The emergence of R. fennica cercariae began during July and continued throughout September in Lake Saravesi. The duration of cercariae emergence was found to be up to 72 days in the laboratory. R. campanula cercariae in the northern Lake Kuivasjarvi emerged from mid-June until mid-August. | ['makela', 'taskinen', 'valtonen'] | ","['makela', 'taskinen', 'valtonen']",0
235,"Quaternary palaeoenvironments and multi-storey valley fill architecture along the Mezen and Severnaya Dvina river valleys, Arkhangelsk region, NW Russia | The modern Severnaya Dvina and Mezen river systems in the Arkhangelsk region, NW Russia, are located within extensive palaeovalley systems. The palaeovalleys form depressions in bedrock and have controlled the drainage systems in the area at least since the Last Interglacial. Vertically stacked marine to fluvial sediments reflect deposition during fluctuating climate and sea levels. A compilation of lithostratigraphical data collected during the last decade has been coupled with bedrock topography and geomorphology from satellite images in order to describe the valley fill architecture for the two valley systems. Each system has been divided into a number of depositional units (storeys) separated by incision/non-deposition and used to investigate the timing of aggradational versus incisional phases. Time constraints for each phase are provided by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, and aggradation and incision are linked to independent records of climate and sea level change. The pattern of aggradation and erosion is regional and primarily driven by episodes of increasing and decreasing sediment supply. Aggradation is correlated to times of deglaciation with high sediment supply from the ice margin, release of sediment from ice-dammed lakes and low vegetation and degradation of permafrost on the flood plain. Incision is related to cold intervals with low sediment supply, delayed incision due to isostatic uplift and drainage of ice-dammed lakes. Relative sea level change controls the distribution of marine deposits, which show significant regional variations due to variable isostatic response across the region. Sea level change plays a limited role for fluvial aggradation/incision in the study area. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

236,"Holocene range of Mytilus edulis in central East Greenland | Radiocarbon age determinations on shells of the common mussel (Mytilus edulis) show that this species was present in central East Greenland from approximately 9500 to 5400 cal. years BP. It probably arrived first at the outer coast, at a time when the inner parts of the fjords were still occupied by glaciers. After perhaps a millennium it spread to the central fjord region where it lived for at least three millennia. The former occurrence of Mytilus edulis indicates higher sea surface temperatures than at present and more extensive fjord water, which may have been a consequence of higher summer insolation, perhaps amplified by changes in atmospheric circulation, bringing more warm air masses to the north. The timing of the Holocene thermal maximum in the lowlands of East Greenland was later than recorded in the Renland ice core. This delay was probably related to the continuing recession of the margin of the Greenland ice sheet in the early Holocene. The lingering decaying ice meant that large lowland areas were still ice covered, and other areas were cooled by the ice. | ['bennike', 'wagner'] | ","['bennike', 'wagner']",2
237,"Rapid adjustments of the western part of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Mid and Late Weichselian - a new model | Regional Quaternary stratigraphy, fossil content (marine mollusc shells, dinocysts, pollen, etc.), some palaeomagnetic data, and more than 200 datings, Mostly AMS-C-14 datings of organic-bearing tills and sub-till waterlain sediments from the northern, central and southern parts of Norway are the basis for construction of nine glaciation curves from the inland to the coast and shelf, and for interpretation of the palaeoclimate. The results show rapid shifts between glacial and interstadial conditions in semi-cycles of five thousand to seven thousand years in the interval from c. 40-45 ka to 10 ka (C-14) BP. We describe these glacial variations in a new model which reflects rapid and rythmic glacier fluctuations. The conclusions with regard to number and size (extent) of the glacial and interstadial events are based on stratigraphy, whereas the timing and rapidity of events are based on dates. AE these basis data are presented more thoroughly in an accompanying paper (this volume). The interstadials are named the Hattfjelldal interstadial I (30-39 ka BP) and II (24-27 ka BP), and the Trofors interstadial (17-21 ka BP). Previously reported interstadials are extended in this study to include larger inland areas, indicating extreme fluctuations several times both in the extent and volume of the ice. Considerable ice retreat with very extensive ice-free areas in several parts of Norway during the last two interstadials (c. 24-27 and c. 17-21 ka BP) have not been reported before, except for preliminary short notices from our studies. The stratigraphical record includes many indications of high pre-Holocene relative sea-levels, suggesting a considerable glacial isostatic depression of western Scandinavia during the interstadials. We suggest that, in addition to precipitation, the mountainous fjord and valley topography, glacial isostasy and relative sea-level changes were probably more important for the size of the glacial fluctuations than the air-temperature changes. | ['bergstrom', 'olsen', 'sveian'] | ","['bergstrom', 'olsen', 'sveian']",1
238,"Rapid thermokarst evolution during the mid-Holocene in Central Yakutia, Russia | The reconstruction of Holocene thermokarst landform evolution is important to understand the potential impact of current global climate change on permafrost regions. A multi-proxy approach was applied to analyse the sedimentological and biogeochemical characteristics as well as pollen and lacustrine microfossils of a core profile drilled in a small pingo within a large Central Yakutian thermokarst basin (alas). Age-depth modelling with macrofossil C-14 ages reveals high thermokarst deposit sedimentation rates and a complete thermokarst sequence spanning about 900 years during the mid-Holocene between similar to 6750 and 5870 cal. yr BP. In total, three stages of thermokarst landscape evolution have been identified. Thermokarst processes were initiated at 6750 to 6500 cal. yr BP. Terrestrial conditions changed quickly to lacustrine conditions, and a thermokarst lake rapidly emerged and grew to an estimated size of 120-600 m diameter and 7.5-15 m depth during only similar to 150 years between similar to 6500 and 6350 cal. yr BP. The decline of thermokarst processes and lake decrease may have been affected by local hydrological conditions between similar to 6350 and 5870 cal. yr BP but ceased completely after 5870 cal. yr BP, likely due to climatic changes. Clear evidence for long-lasting and stable lacustrine conditions was not obtained. The study emphasises that short-term warming led to very active permafrost degradation and rapid but locally variable modification of alas and thermokarst evolution. | ['fedorov', 'frolova', 'rudaya', 'schmidt', 'siegert', 'ulrich', 'wetterich', 'zielhofer'] | ","['fedorov', 'frolova', 'rudaya', 'schmidt', 'siegert', 'ulrich', 'wetterich', 'zielhofer']",4

240,"Recent climate warming drives ecological change in a remote high-Arctic lake | The high Arctic is the fastest warming region on Earth, evidenced by extreme near-surface temperature increase in non-summer seasons, recent rapid sea ice decline and permafrost melting since the early 1990's. Understanding the impact of climate change on the sensitive Arctic ecosystem to climate change has so far been hampered by the lack of time-constrained, high-resolution records and by implicit climate data analyses. Here, we show evidence of sharp growth in freshwater green algae as well as distinct diatom assemblage changes since ~1995, retrieved from a high-Arctic (80 degrees N) lake sediment record on Barentsoya (Svalbard). The proxy record approaches an annual to biennial resolution. Combining remote sensing and in-situ climate data, we show that this ecological change is concurrent with, and is likely driven by, the atmospheric warming and a sharp decrease in the length of the sea ice covered period in the region, and throughout the Arctic. Moreover, this research demonstrates the value of palaeoclimate records in pristine environments for supporting and extending instrumental records. Our results reinforce and extend observations from other sites that the high Arctic has already undergone rapid ecological changes in response to on-going climate change, and will continue to do so in the future. | ['akkerman', 'hagemans', 'hoek', 'hoof', 'lenaerts', 'woelders'] | ","['akkerman', 'hagemans', 'hoek', 'hoof', 'lenaerts', 'woelders']",4

We present a similar to 13.6 ka summer temperature reconstruction in central Yukon, part of Eastern Beringia, using precipitation isotopes in syngenetic permafrost. The reconstruction shows that early Holocene summers were consistently warmer than the Holocene mean, as supported by midges, and a thermal maximum at similar to 7.6-6.6 ka BP. This maximum was followed by a similar to 6 ka cooling, and later abruptly reversed by industrial-era warming leading to a modern climate that is unprecedented in the Holocene context and exceeds the Holocene thermal maximum by +1.7 +/- 0.7 degrees C. | ['bandara', 'davy', 'froese', 'porter', 'schoenemann', 'steig'] | ","['bandara', 'davy', 'froese', 'porter', 'schoenemann', 'steig']",4

243,"Reconstructing the postglacial climatic changes of Lapland | The climate history of northern Fennoscandia (Lapland) can be assessed on different time scales and reconstructed using various methods, focusing on low-frequency trends and high-frequency events. Pollen-based climate reconstructions suggest that the early Holocene in Lapland was characterised by maritime conditions: mild temperatures and high precipitation. Summer temperatures reached an acme 8,000-6,500 years ago (cal yr B.P.), when they averaged 2.2-1.6 degrees centrigrade (¬∞C) higher than at present. This was followed by gradual cooling towards the present. Many other independent methods, notably those based on Greenland ice core 18O data and glacier equilibrium line altitude changes in Fennoscandia, support the reconstructed general trends. The possible existence of short-term events in Lapland's climate history is also discussed. Cooler periods can be identified at least at circa 11,300 years ago and during the Little Ice Age (800-300 years ago).

244,"Reconstructing Arctic Precipitation Seasonality Using Aquatic Leaf Wax delta H-2 in Lakes With Contrasting Residence Times | Arctic precipitation is predicted to increase this century. Records of past precipitation seasonality provide baselines for a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics controlling Arctic precipitation. We present an approach to reconstruct Arctic precipitation seasonality using stable hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2) of aquatic plant waxes in neighboring lakes with contrasting water residence times and present a case study of this approach in two lakes on western Greenland. Residence time calculations suggest that growing season lake water delta H-2 in one lake reflects summer precipitation delta H-2, while the other reflects amount-weighted annual precipitation delta H-2 and evaporative enrichment. Aquatic plant wax delta H-2 in the ""summer lake"" is relatively constant throughout the Holocene, perhaps reflecting competing effects of local summer warmth and increased distal moisture transport due to a strengthened latitudinal temperature gradient. In contrast, aquatic plant wax delta H-2 in the ""mean annual lake"" is 100 parts per thousand H-2 depleted from 6 to 4 ka relative to the beginning and end of the record. Because there are relatively minor changes in summer precipitation delta H-2, we interpret the 100 parts per thousand H-2 depletion in mean annual precipitation to reflect an increase in winter precipitation amount, likely accompanied by changes in winter precipitation delta H-2 and decreased evaporative enrichment. Thus, unlike the ""summer lake,"" the ""mean annual lake"" records changes in winter precipitation. This dual-lake approach may be applied to reconstruct past changes in precipitation seasonality at sites with strong precipitation isotope seasonality and minimal lake water evaporative enrichment. | ['cluett', 'corcoran', 'hollister', 'thomas'] | ","['cluett', 'corcoran', 'hollister', 'thomas']",3

The data presented here have been obtained using the mutual climatic range (MCR) method based on beetle assemblage data. The sites range across a transect from Ireland in the west to Poland and Finland in the east. Thermal gradients have been derived from the data using multiple linear regression. The regression models were solved for each of a series of 'time windows'. Each interval has a separate time-dependant trend, which was removed by detrending before solving the regression equations. The robustness and confidence intervals of the regression coefficients were estimated using the bootstrap method, with samples being selected from the data set by Monte Carlo simulation. The resulting palaeotemperature gradients were compared with modern temperature gradients over Europe. The data suggest that there were significant changes in the steepness of latitudinal temperature gradients over northern Europe during the past 45000 yr, although most attention in our compilations is focused on the last glacial-Holocene transition, the period for which the most abundant data are available so far. A significant delay in warming at the end of the last glacial stage in the northern part of the study area, by comparison with the southern sector, is also inferred. Reasons for these temporal and geographical variations and their possible palaeoclimatic implications are discussed.

248,"Holocene relative sea-level changes in the Qaqortoq area, southern Greenland | We present results from an investigation of relative sea-level changes in the Qaqortoq area in south Greenland from c. 11 000 cal. yr BP to the present. Isolation and transgression sequences from six lakes and two tidal basins have been identified using stratigraphical analyses, magnetic susceptibility, XRF and macrofossil analyses. Macrofossils and bulk sediments have been dated by AMS radiocarbon dating. Maximum and minimum altitudes for relative sea level are provided from two deglaciation and marine lagoon sequences. Initially, relative sea level fell rapidly and reached present-day level at ‚àº9000 cal. yr BP and continued falling until at least 8800 cal. yr BP. Between 8000 and 6000 cal. yr BP, sea level reached its lowest level of around 6-8m below highest astronomical tide (h.a.t.). At around 3750 cal. yr BP, sea level has reached above 2.7m below h.a.t. and continued to rise slowly, reaching the present-day level between ‚àº2000 cal. yr BP and the present. As in the Nanortalik area further south, initial isostatic rebound caused rapid isolation of low elevation basins in the Qaqortoq area. Distinct isolation contacts in the sediments are observed. The late Holocene transgression is less well defined and occurred over a longer time interval. The late Holocene sea-level rise implies reloading by advancing glaciers superimposed on the isostatic signal from the North American Ice Sheet. One consequence of this transgression is that settlements of Palaeo-Eskimo cultures from ‚àº4000 cal. yr BP may have been transgressed by the sea. | ['bennike', 'bj√∂rck', 'lambeck', 'sparrenbom'] | ","['bennike', 'bj√∂rck', 'lambeck', 'sparrenbom']",4
249,"Relative sea-level changes since 15 000 cal. yr BP in the Nanortalik area, southern Greenland | We present new results for relative sea-level change for Southern Greenland for the interval from 9000 cal. yr BP to the present. Together with earlier work from the same region this yields a nearly complete record from the time of deglaciation to the present. Isolation and/or transgression sequences in one lake and five tidal basins have been identified using lithostratigraphic analyses, sedimentary characteristics, magnetic susceptibility, saturated induced remanent magnetisation (SIRM), organic and carbonate content, and macrofossil analyses. AMS radiocarbon dating of macrofossils and bulk sediment samples provides the timescale. Relative sea level fell rapidly and reached present-day level at similar to 9300 cal.yr BP and continued falling until at least 9000 cal.yr BP. Between 8000and6000cal.yrBPsea level reached its lowest level of around similar to 10m below highest astronomical tide. At around 5000 cal. yr BP, sea level had reached above 7.8 m below highest astronomical tide and slowly continued to rise, not reaching present-day sea level until today. The isostatic rebound caused rapid isolation of the basins that are seen as distinct isolation contacts in the sediments. In contrast, the late Holocene transgressions are less well defined and occurred over longer time intervals. The late Holocene sea-level rise may be a consequence of isostatic reloading by advancing glaciers and/or an effect of the delayed response to isostatic rebound of the Laurentide ice sheet. One consequence of this transgression is that settlements of Palaeo-Eskimo Cultures may be missing in Southern Greenland.

250,"High-resolution analyses of an early Holocene climate event may imply decreased solar forcing as an important climate trigger | Early Holocene lacustrine, tree-ring, ice-core, and marine records reveal that the Northern Hemisphere underwent a short cooling event at 10300 calendar yr B.P. (9100 C-14 yr B.P.). The records were compared on a common high-resolution time scale and show that the event lasted less than 200 yr, with a cooling peak of 50 yr, and the event coincides with a distinct Holocene thermohaline disturbance recognized in the North Adantic Ocean. In spite of well-known freshwater forcings at the time of the event, the negligible difference between the modeled Delta C-14 record, based on the GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) Be-10 data, and the measured values, does not allow for detectable Delta C-14 changes related to global ocean ventilation. We can, however, show that the onset of the cooling coincides with the onset of one of the largest Holocene Be-10 flux peaks. This finding may imply that the climate system is more sensitive to solar-related changes than previously thought and that such changes may be an important underlying mechanism for sub-Milankovitch climate variability. | ['andresen', 'bjorck', 'conley', 'heinemeier', 'johnsen', 'johnsen', 'koc', 'kromer', 'muscheler', 'spurk', 'veski'] | ","['andresen', 'bjorck', 'conley', 'heinemeier', 'johnsen', 'johnsen', 'koc', 'kromer', 'muscheler', 'spurk', 'veski']",2

The aim of this research was to revive and/or characterize fungi and fungal DNA entrapped in ancient ice cores from Greenland. Two main methods were developed to detect these micro-organisms in glacial ice: (1) Culturing to obtain viable isolates which were characterized by microscopy, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification and DNA sequencing, using fungal ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer primers; and (2) PCR amplification and DNA sequencing directly from glacial ice. Hundreds of viable fungi (as well as bacteria) were isolated, and DNA sequences were obtained from Greenland ice cores up to 140,000 years old. Some sequences derived directly from ice melt resembled those of contemporary species, while others exhibited little similarity to well-characterized present-day fungi. Species diversity varied among the ice cores. Some fungi remain viable for over 100,000 years in ice. This leads to the possibility that a species can appear to become extinct, but may be capable of reappearing at a later point in time. | ['catranis', 'rogers', 'starmer'] | ","['catranis', 'rogers', 'starmer']",4

Our aim is to identify episodes of unpredictable change in the context of long-term trends of cultural and environmental development. Key changes are identified in the proxy climate records in 975 and 980 AD, 1025 and 1040 AD, 1180 AD, 1425 and 1450 AD, and 1520 and 1525 AD. Some of these changes are consistent with those inferred from new studies of the palaeoecological record of the Faroes. This indicates that the cumulative deviation measure could give greatest prominence to the most important climate changes affecting landscapes and settlement (such as the changes of 1425 and 1450 AD and their immediate aftermath), rather than extreme events, such as great single storms. | ['borthwick', 'church', 'dawson', 'dugmore', 'edward', 'keller', 'mairs', 'mayewski', 'mcgovern', 'sveinbjarnardottir'] | ","['borthwick', 'church', 'dawson', 'dugmore', 'edward', 'keller', 'mairs', 'mayewski', 'mcgovern', 'sveinbjarnardottir']",3
254,"The role of global and local factors in determining the middle to late Holocene environmental history of the South Kurile and Komandar islands, northwestern Pacific | The study of Holocene deposits from northwestern Pacific Islands is very important for understanding the natural development of the area in the context of oceanic climate, strong microclimate variability, and the influence of contrasting marine currents. Holocene sections from Bering Island record the following events: cooling at about 4600-4500 yr BP; warming at about 3500-3400 yr BP; cooling at about 3000 yr BP; sea-level rise (up to 1.5 in) at about 2700 BP; cooling at about 1800-1400 yr BP; and sea-level rise at about 1000 yr BP On the South Kuriles, a dry and cool climate changed to warm and moist about 7000-6500 yr BP, later than on Hokkaido Island. At this time, the Kuroshio Current system became more active and birch assemblages were replaced by cool-temperate broadleaf forests and mixed coniferous/broadleaf forests. At the Holocene Optimum (about 6000 yr BP), temperate broadleaf forest occupied almost all of Kunashir and the Okhotsk side of Iturup and the climate was warmer than present. The highest sea-level position reached was 2.5 - 3 in above present level about 6500-6300 yr BP. During the cooling about 4700-4500 yr BP, island vegetation changed slightly due to the influence of warm currents. Major sea-level regression during this period led to the formation of extensive coastal dune fields. The warming at the beginning of the late Holocene was almost as great as that of the Holocene Optimum. Two minor transgressions are recorded. The vegetation changes and climatic deterioration that took place in the second half of the late Holocene resulted in either a disappearance of thermophylous taxa or in a southward shift of their natural habitats. During the cooling from 1700 to 1300 yr BP, the isthmus area increased, coastal wetlands with lakes and coastal dunes with paleosols were formed, and grassland and swamp landscapes developed. Late Holocene warming was not intensive. Volcanic impact on environments led to changes in vegetation assemblage, swamping of the area, and thick soil profile formation. Copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.

255,"The role of sea ice for vascular plant dispersal in the Arctic | Sea ice has been suggested to be an important factor for dispersal of vascular plants in the Arctic. To assess its role for postglacial colonization in the North Atlantic region, we compiled data on the first Late Glacial to Holocene occurrence of vascular plant species in East Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Svalbard. For each record, we reconstructed likely past dispersal events using data on species distributions and genetics. We compared these data to sea-ice reconstructions to evaluate the potential role of sea ice in these past colonization events and finally evaluated these results using a compilation of driftwood records as an independent source of evidence that sea ice can disperse biological material. Our results show that sea ice was, in general, more prevalent along the most likely dispersal routes at times of assumed first colonization than along other possible routes. Also, driftwood is frequently dispersed in regions that have sea ice today. Thus, sea ice may act as an important dispersal agent. Melting sea ice may hamper future dispersal of Arctic plants and thereby cause more genetic differentiation. It may also limit the northwards expansion of competing boreal species, and hence favour the persistence of Arctic species. | ['alsos', 'bennike', 'ehrich', 'geirsdottir', 'kirchhefer', 'seidenkrantz'] | ","['alsos', 'bennike', 'ehrich', 'geirsdottir', 'kirchhefer', 'seidenkrantz']",4
256,"Salt marshes as archives of recent relative sea level change in West Greenland | Temperate latitude salt marshes are a proven environment from which high precision (+/- 0.10-0.20 m) relative sea level (RSL) records can be developed over recent decades and centuries. Such records provide an important link between millennial histories of RSL change and instrumental records. The high latitude salt marshes in Greenland have not previously been explored as potential archives of recent RSL change. Here we develop four diatom-based transfer functions using contemporary diatom data collected from three salt marshes located 40 km south of the coastal town of Sisimiut, West Greenland. Our preferred model has a good fit between observed and predicted elevations (r(2) = 0.94) and a root mean square error prediction of +/- 0.19 m. We apply the four models to a short sediment profile collected from one of the marshes that formed between c. 600 cal. year BP and the present. Three of the four models predict the same trend in which RSL rose from-0.55 +/- 0.19 m mean tide level (MTL) to -0.05 +/- 0.19 m MTL between c. 600 and 400 cal. year BP at a rate of c. 2.7 mm year(-1). After 400 cal. year BP RSL slowed and remained stable until the present day. The results of this study demonstrate that Greenland salt marshes are potentially valuable archives of data for developing quantitative estimates of RSL change during the last few centuries, thereby bridging the gap between existing millennial-scale approaches and more recent direct observations of ice sheet behaviour and associated vertical land motions.

257,"What they saw: The climatic and environmental context for Euro-Canadian settlement in Alberta | Late nineteenth-century Euro-Canadian settlers in Alberta moved into a landscape that was the product of millennia of postglacial climatic and environmental change and at least ten thousand years of human occupation. This article sets the landscape encountered by those settlers into context by reviewing postglacial climatic and vegetation history. During and after deglaciation, warming and plant migration established the broad outline of ecozones (such as boreal forest and prairies) by about 9,000 years ago. Subsequently, many palaeoenvironmental records show an interval of warmer and drier climate, signalled by increased salinity or drying of prairie lakes, northward retreat of the southern boreal forest margin, and increased fire frequency. This Hypsithermal Interval may be the best analogue for future conditions under continued climate warming. In about the last 4,000 years, climate has generally been cooler and moister, culminating in renewed ice advances in the Rockies in the last few centuries: the Little Ice Age. From this perspective, Euro-Canadian settlement occurred in what was arguably the coolest and wettest interval of the last 10,000 years. The palaeoenvironmental record contains valuable information for land managers and planners, especially with respect to the vulnerable prairie ecoregion. | ['beaudoin'] | ",['beaudoin'],1

259,"Sea ice expansion in the Bering Sea during the Neoglacial: evidence from archaeozoology | The Neoglacial was a period of cold that lasted more than 2000 years during the mid-Holocene, from approximately 4700 to 2500 years ago. Although proxy data from a number of sources document the regional onset and duration of cold conditions in the Northern Hemisphere during this period, none have suggested an expansion of sea ice in the Bering Sea. Here we provide new evidence that Neoglacial sea ice expansion in the Bering Sea was substantial enough to have altered the distribution of North Pacific pinnipeds and cetaceans, using prehistoric skeletal remains recovered from an archaeological site on the island of Unalaska in the eastern Aleutians (Amaknak Bridge, occupied from c. 3500-2500 yr BP (radiocarbon years before present, uncalibrated)). Comprehensive archaeozoological analysis of the Amaknak Bridge fauna indicates that sea ice in the Bering Sea must have reached a more southerly position at the height of the Neoglacial and persisted longer than it does today. We infer from this evidence that for most of the Neoglacial period, sea ice must have surrounded the Pribilof Islands until early summer and blocked the Bering Strait until late summer. Such an expansion and seasonal persistence of sea ice would have prevented fur seals from using the Pribilofs as a summer breeding rookery and whales from making summer migrations into arctic waters to feed, as they do today. We suggest this expansion of sea ice in the Bering Sea during the Neoglacial may explain several unresolved phenomena of mammalian distributions, genetic partitioning and extinctions in the North Pacific. | ['crockford', 'frederick'] | ","['crockford', 'frederick']",2
260,"Arctic sea ice in transformation: A review of recent observed changes and impacts on biology and human activity | Sea ice in the Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing components of the global climate system. Over the past few decades, summer areal extent has declined over 30%, and all months show statistically significant declining trends. New satellite missions and techniques have greatly expanded information on sea ice thickness, but many uncertainties remain in the satellite data and long-term records are sparse. However, thickness observations and other satellite-derived data indicate a 40% decline in thickness, due in large part to the loss of thicker, older ice cover. The changes in sea ice are happening faster than models have projected. With continued increasing temperatures, summer ice-free conditions are likely sometime in the coming decades, though there are substantial uncertainties in the exact timing and high interannual variability will remain as sea ice decreases. The changes in Arctic sea ice are already having an impact on flora and fauna in the Arctic. Some species will face increasing challenges in the future, while new habitat will open up for other species. The changes are also affecting people living and working in the Arctic. Native communities are facing challenges to their traditional ways of life, while new opportunities open for shipping, fishing, and natural resource extraction. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding of Arctic sea ice and its role in climate, the ecosystem, and human activities. However, significant challenges remain in furthering the knowledge of the processes, impacts, and future evolution of the system. ¬© 2014. American Geophysical Union.

Driftwood entry to northern Greenland was rare until 7400 cal. years BP, indicating more severe summer sea-ice conditions than at present.

In central East Greenland, the occurrence of the extralimital species Mytilus edulis in the time interval from c. 8500 to 6000 cal. years BP indicates more open water than at present, and in northwest Greenland studies of dinoflagellate cysts in a marine core indicate warmer surface waters, and hence less sea ice than at present from 7300 to 3700 cal. years BP. | ['bennike'] | ",['bennike'],2
262,"A Holocene seabird record from Raffles So sediments, East Greenland, in response to climatic and oceanic changes | A 3.5-m-long sediment sequence from a lake on Raffles O, off Liverpool Land, East Greenland, was investigated for chronology, lithology, palynology and biogeochemistry. Radiocarbon-dating of plant remains and the lithology of the sediment succession indicate continuous sedimentation since deglaciation of the area prior to 10000 cal. yr BP. The postglacial palynological record shows little variation and evidence of a wind-transported pollen supply, both resulting from the geographical characteristics of Raffles O. Significant variations in the biogeochemical data reflect changes in aquatic bioproduction. These changes depend to some extent on climatic changes; however, they are mainly due to variations in seabird breeding colonies in the catchment which influence nutrient and cadmium supply to the lake. Large seabird breeding colonies were present between 7500 and 1900, from 1000 to 500, and since c. 100 cal. yr BP. Their absence prior to 7500 cal. yr BP may be the result of unsuitable feeding conditions close to Raffles O caused by a too dense or too open sea-ice cover. In contrast, between 1900 and 1000 and from 500 to 100 cal. yr BP, the seabird settlement was probably restricted by an insufficiently long breeding season due to cold climate conditions in East Greenland. | ['melles', 'wagner'] | ","['melles', 'wagner']",1

A second period of low-water level occurred at the end of the 1950s and lasted until the beginning of the 1970s.

The delta O-18(diatom) records reveal common responses to precipitation forcing over the past millennium. Relatively wet summers are inferred from delta O-18(diatom) between 1000 and 1080 AD, 1300 and 1440 AD, and during the early 19th century, coincided with periods of high cloud cover inferred from tree-ring carbon isotopes, and other data for high Arctic Oscillation index. While relatively dry summers with increasing influence of winter snow are indicated between 1600 and 1750 AD.

After drainage of a lake, peat forming vegetation invaded rapidly. Comparison with palaeotemperature data shows that the initial formation of mature ridges coincided with a period of high summer temperatures around AD 1400. The ridges persisted and expanded during the subsequent colder ca 200 years. Partial collapse of various ridges at the end of the 18th century corresponded to a phase with low summer temperatures. During the warm, 20th century one collapsed ridge regenerated, whereas another persisted in its collapsed state. Ice-wedge polygons are, thus, complex and highly dynamic ecosystems, in which changes in temperature and precipitation may induce rapid ecological changes by the complex interplay of water, ice and vegetation. Our study indicates that global warming associated with a decrease in summer precipitation may initially result in enhanced polygon ridge formation. The combination of longer summers and increased winter precipitation, as predicted for high latitudes will, however, eventually result in larger meltwater input in the polygon mires, which may cause the (partial) collapse of polygon ridges and underlying ice-wedges.

267,"Changes since the onset of acid deposition among calcium-sensitive cladoceran taxa within softwater lakes of Ontario, Canada | Aqueous calcium (Ca) concentrations are currently decreasing in many softwater lakes on the Boreal Shield. As the onset of these declines often pre-date direct monitoring programs, indirect techniques are required to examine the impacts of reduced Ca availability on aquatic communities with relatively high Ca demands such as the Cladocera (Class: Branchiopoda). Among the Cladocera, the family Daphniidae has been identified as a taxonomic group potentially useful for inferring past Ca concentrations due to their high Ca demands and preservation in lake sediments. Here, we use a ""top/bottom"" paleolimnological analysis to compare present-day cladoceran communities preserved in the surface sediments of 36 softwater lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada, which are potentially vulnerable to Ca decline (i.e. small headwater systems with present-day lakewater [Ca] < 3 mg L-1), with the communities present in lake sediments deposited prior to the onset of regional acid deposition. To distinguish the potential impacts of lake acidification from those of Ca availability (as Ca and pH trends are strongly correlated in this region), the study lakes were chosen to be evenly distributed about a present-day lakewater pH of 6 and Ca concentration of 1.5 mg L-1 (threshold values). Despite the importance of pH as an explanatory variable for the present-day assemblages, a comparison of the sedimentary remains from the two time periods indicate there have been large declines since pre-industrial times in the relative abundances of Ca-rich Daphnia spp. (particularly of the Daphnia longispina species complex), regardless of present-day pH, accompanied by increases in the Ca-poor species Holopedium glacialis. These observations suggest that recent declines in Ca concentration may have already fallen below baseline conditions, with marked implications for ecosystem function due to the differential responses among cladoceran taxa. | ['jeziorski', 'paterson', 'smol'] | ","['jeziorski', 'paterson', 'smol']",1

Relatively cold periods with a duration of the order of 300-600 years occurred frequently during the Holocene. In this paper, dates of the major climatic events are compared with an index of solar activity, the so-called delta(14)C anomalies. For most of the last 9000 years a good correspondence is demonstrated between the tinting of cold events in Scandinavia and the timing of major delta(14)C anomalies (low solar irradiation). The general Holocene cooling trend is believed to be partly a result of land uplift following deglaciation and partly a result of orbitally forced changes in irradiation. Large fluctuations in Scandinavian summer temperature can be reconciled with the pattern of climatic change presented in several recent studies in the North Atlantic region. A link between these areas could be provided by changes in the production of North Atlantic Deep Water. | ['karlen', 'kuylenstierna'] | ","['karlen', 'kuylenstierna']",1
270,"South to north: Contrasting late-glacial and early-Holocene climate changes and vegetation responses between south and north Norway | Norway shows south-north climate and vegetation gradients today. Were there similar gradients during the late-glacial and early Holocene, 14,700-9000 years ago? A comparison was made along a south-north transect in Norway of plant-macrofossil reconstructions of past vegetation changes and independent summer temperature records derived from parallel chironomid data (C-Tjul). Three lake sites were selected with sediment cores with good chronological control. The importance of soil moisture is reflected by the reconstructed vegetation in relation to the temperature regime. Besides climate drivers, how important were intrinsic succession and competition in influencing vegetation patterns? Were migration delays significant, why and by how much? Oceanic climate in the late-glacial in south-west Norway resulted in snow-bed vegetation and glacier development in the Younger Dryas (YD). In contrast, the north was arid and continental, even into the early Holocene. Overall, temperatures were about 2 degrees C colder than in the south. The YD impact differed markedly between south and north Norway. In the south, cooling at c. 12,700 cal. yr BP was swift and marked by strong responses. In the north, there was no impact at the chronological start of the YD, but cooling occurred later about 12,450 cal. yr BP together with increased aridity. During the early Holocene, temperature and oceanicity increased progressively northwards as the North Atlantic Current became established. Birch woodland developed in the south about 660 years after the start of the Holocene, after about 1000 years on AndOya, and after about 1450 years in northernmost Norway. However, the 590 year lag in the south after C-Tjul reached 11 degrees C, the limiting temperature for tree-birch growth, decreased to 400 years in the north, as the birch tree-line kept pace with temperature rise. In the far north, a thermal maximum of 1 degrees C above today's mean July temperature and parallel vegetation development were recorded from 10,100 to 9370 cal. yr BP. On AndOya, temperatures exceeded present values by 1 degrees C after 9700 cal. yr BP. There was no detectable period of above modern temperatures further south before 9000 cal. yr BP. | ['birks'] | ",['birks'],1

272,"Southwards migration of freshwater invertebrates from northern Norway | Remains of larvae of caddis flies (Insecta, Trichoptera) and non-biting midges (Insecta, Chironomidae) were recorded in core samples dated at 12 000-11 000 and about 20 000 B.P., respectively, from lakes on Andoya, Norway (69 degree 15'N). All caddis remains belonged to Apatania zonella (Zetterstedt). 4 Orthocladinae species, Pseudodiamesa sp., Metriocnemus obscuripes (Holmgren), Sp. A and Sp. B (Ortocladius sp.?) were found. Fragments of a crustacean, Lepidurus arcticus Kroyer, were present in sediments dated to ca 12 800 B.P. Ice-free areas and lotic/lentic (running/standing water) habitats have been present on Andoya at least from ca 22 000 B.P. Of insects, chironomids must have been one of the earliest colonizers of freshwater habitats, and we suggest that A. zonella was the first arctic/alpine caddis species to colonize Norway after the last ice age. The existence of an ice-free coastal refugium, from at least 22 000 B.P. on Andoya, strongly suggest an early southwards migration of arctic/alpine aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates from this area through Norway and Sweden, in addition to immigration from the south and east during and after the deglaciation. | ['alm', 'solem'] | ","['alm', 'solem']",4
273,"The spatial and temporal complexity of the holocene thermal maximum | The Holocene thermal maximum, a period of relatively warm climate between 11,000 and 5,000 years ago, is most clearly recorded in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is generally associated with the local orbitally forced summer insolation maximum. However, proxy-based reconstructions have shown that both the timing and magnitude of the warming vary substantially between different regions, suggesting the involvement of extra feedbacks and forcings. Here, we simulate the Holocene thermal maximum in a coupled global ocean-atmosphere-vegetation model. We find that before 7,000 years ago, summers were substantially cooler over regions directly influenced by the presence of the Laurentide ice sheet, whereas other regions of the Northern Hemisphere were dominated by orbital forcing. Our simulations suggest that the cool conditions arose from a combination of the inhibition of Labrador Sea deep convection by the flux of meltwater from the ice sheet, which weakened northward heat transport by the ocean, and the high surface albedo of the ice sheet. We thus conclude that interglacial climate is highly sensitive to relatively small changes in ice-sheet configuration. ¬© 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

274,"Spatial and temporal variability of lake ontogeny in south-western Greenland | Holocene palaeolimnological records of diatoms and beta carotene (a proxy for aquatic production) from four lakes in the low Arctic region of south-western Greenland were used to investigate the role of climate on lake ontogeny. Two of the lakes are located in the maritime, coastal region near Sisimiut and two inland close to the head of Kangerlussuaq fjord, where there is a more continental climate. Diatom records from the four lakes (AT1, AT4, SS1381, SS8) had similar long-term ontogeny trends, independent of climatic setting and the changes are interpreted as responses to first order weathering controls on catchment/lake chemistry. Short-term excursions from these broad trends occurred in one coastal site (AT4) caused by intense erosion of the steep catchment, and at inland sites where temporary hydrological closure and lake level decline occurred during the mid-Holocene (similar to 8000 - 5000 cal a BP). Algal production (as beta carotene) was more closely and consistently correlated with climatic changes; it peaked during the mid-Holocene, the warmest period of the Holocene, at all sites and there were transient increases in production in inland lakes during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age because of fertilization through increased aeolian dust deposition. A synthesis of seven palaeolimnological records from this region identified that only the mid-Holocene was correlated with diatom stratigraphic zones and there was considerable among-site variability in later Holocene lake response to climate forcing in this area. Comparable long-term trends in species assemblage turnover (DCA/CA axis 1 scores) clearly demonstrate that lakes have predictable ontogeny trends in this region, characterised by maximum alkalinity and nutrient availability in the first few millennia followed by progressive oligotrophication and alkalinity loss. However, individual lake and catchment characteristics (lake morphology, catchment geomorphology), when modified by climatic change (vegetation cover, erosion, weathering rates, aeolian dust deposition, lake level) can diverge from this ontogeny template leading to complex ecological transitions in lakes from this region.

275,"Stable carbon isotope variations in northwest Europe during the last glacial-interglacial transition | Stable carbon isotope data that span part of the last glacial-interglacial transition (ca. 14-9 ka C-14 BP; Ca. 15-11 ka cal. BP), and which derive from organ-specific plant macrofossils recovered from two lake sediment profiles in the UK and one in Norway, are compared. The recorded temporal variations show similar trends, which, over a millennial timescale appear to parallel the main drift in delta(18)O as determined for the GRIP ice-core. It is postulated that some smaller scale variations in the delta(13)C profiles may reflect the shorter term oscillations in delta(18)O values evident in the GRIP record, although this is less certain. Overall, however, the results suggest that stable carbon isotope measurements based on organ-specific terrestrial plant macrofossils may provide (i) a means for establishing correlations between terrestrial successions and (ii) additional paleoenvironmental information, as the apparent 'shadowing' of the GRIP record indicates a common forcing mechanism for both Greenland delta(18)O and northwest European delta(13)C variations. From the evidence available we suggest that the recorded delta(13)C variations reflect fluctuations in air temperature and/or changes in water vapour pressure in the atmosphere.

276,"Stratigraphy of peatlands in central and northern Sweden: evidence of Holocene climatic change and peat accumulation | Early peat surveys demonstrated the potential to detect Holocene climatic changes in southern Sweden through analysis of the degree of decomposition of Sphagnum peat and motivated systematic collection of peat-strati graphic information during subsequent geological mappings in central and northern Sweden. The resulting (published and unpublished) data was compiled and reanalysed, taking into account unpublished radiocarbon data and developments in radiocarbon calibration and pollen-stratigraphic dating. Data from 61 carefully selected sites indicate a peat initiation maximum centred in the north 9500-8000 cal. BP and interpreted to primarily reflect climatic change. The cause for a secondary maximum 6000-5500 cal. BP centred further south is less clear. Peat deposition data show a continuous increase in the period 10 500-2000 cal. BP, with almost constant values during recent millennia, indicating that peatlands in the region acted as a long-term Holocene carbon sink and increasingly so until c. 2000 years ago. Sphagnum peat decomposition data display a long-term trend towards wetter conditions after 5000 cal. BP interpreted to primarily reflect progressively stronger westerly airflow and an accompanying increase in precipitation. These data also show that wet shifts occurred more frequently across the region around 3300, 2500-2100 and 1300 cal. BP. The timing of peak frequencies of wet shifts is similar to that of supposedly climate-related wet shifts identified in southern Sweden. Variability in frequency of wet shifts is most strongly pronounced in the south-west, with an apparent periodicity of 800-1000 years believed to reflect regular changes in westerly airflow during the mid and late Holocene. | ['rundgren'] | ",['rundgren'],1
277,"Surficial geology of the glenyon map area, Yukon territory | Regional Quaternary mapping and stratigraphic and sedimentological studies were undertaken in the Glenlyo map area (NTS 105 L), with stratigraphic studies extending westward into the Carmacks map area (NTS 115-1). Surficial sediments were divided into 23 units, which range from Early Pleistocene to Holocene. Evidence exists for at least three glaciations: pre-Raid (Early Pleistocene), Reid (Middle Pleistocene), and McConnell (Late Wisconsinan). Deposits of the Pre-Reid glaciations(s) have a very subdued surface morphology. The Reid Glaciation was less extensive and has better preserved landforms. Organic beds of Middle Wisconsinan age were identified, and insect macrofossils and pollen indicate forested conditions at 36000-37000 BP. Landforms and sediments of the McConnell Glaciation are well preserved, allowing for better reconstruction of conditions than the previous glaciations. The stratigraphic record suggests that rivers aggraded and an oscillation in the location of the ice front occurred during glacial advance. At glacial maximum, the Selwyn and Cassiar lobes of the Cordillera Ice Sheet affected the area, with topography strongly controlling ice flow. Because of aridity, local cirques in the Glenlyon Range supported only small glaciers that did not contribute to the Selwyn Lobe. At the end of the McConnel Glaciations, the retreat of glaciers was very rapid, with the ice sheet downwasting and stagnating in place. Many small lake basins developed in the Pelly River valley and large thicknesses of sediment were deposited on top of stagnant ice. Sediments were derived from the active ice margin, stagnant ice, marginal streams, and recently deglaciated valley sides. | [] | ",,4
278,"Temperature gradients in northern Europe during the last glacial-Holocene transition (14-9 C-14 kyr BP) interpreted from coleopteran assemblages | Late-glacial and early Holocene climatic conditions have been reconstructed for northern Europe using the mutual climatic range (MCR) palaeoclimate method based on fossil coleopteran assemblages. Altogether, beetle faunas from 77 sites have been analysed ranging from Ireland in the west to Poland and Finland in the east, and MCR estimates calculated. The results are plotted on 16 maps, each representative of a selected time-slice covering the period from 14.5 C-14 kyr BP to 9.0 C-14 kyr BP. Eight of the maps show the MCR estimates of T-max (mean temperature of the warmest month) derived from each site for which data are available, while the remainder show estimated T-max isotherms interpolated from these values. It can be demonstrated that at times the thermal climate was fairly uniform throughout the study area, whereas at others temperature gradients were much steeper than they are in the region today. There also appears to be a distinct contrast between cold periods, when contours trended NW-SE, and warmer periods, when contours trend W-E or even NE-SW. The pattern of climatic changes that emerges is shown to be very different from the traditional view that has been used up to now as a template for classifying Late-glacial climatic events on a wide, even global, scale. The suddenness and intensity of changes in the thermal climate may have been partially responsible for an apparent lack of equilibrium between the flora and fauna of the time and the physical environment in which they lived.

279,"Holocene temperature history of northwest Greenland - With new ice cap constraints and chironomid assemblages from Deltaso | Arctic temperature shifts drive changes in carbon cycling, sea ice extent and Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance, all of which have global ramifications. Paleoclimate data from past warm periods provide a unique means for assessing the sensitivity of these systems to warming climate, but the magnitude and timing of past temperature changes in many parts of the Arctic are poorly known. Here we assess orbital scale Holocene temperature change in northwest Greenland near the margin of the ice sheet using subfossil insect assemblages from lake Deltaso. Based upon sedimentation history in this currently proglacial lake, we also place constraints on Holocene extents of the adjacent North Ice Cap, a large independent ice cap. Reconstructed summer temperatures were warmer than present at the onset of lacustrine sedimentation following regional deglaciation by the Greenland Ice Sheet, sometime between 10.8 and 10.1 ka BP. Deltaso experienced the warmest summer temperatures of the Holocene between similar to 10 and 6.2 ka BP, followed by progressive cooling that continued through the late Holocene as summer insolation declined, culminating in the lowest temperatures during the pre-industrial last millennium. Deltaso chironomids indicate peak early Holocene summer temperatures at least 2.5-3 degrees C warmer than modern and at least 3.5-4 degrees C warmer than the pre-industrial last millennium. We infer based upon lake sediment organic and biogenic content that in response to declining temperatures, North Ice Cap reached its present-day size similar to 1850 AD, having been smaller than present through most of the preceding Holocene. Our synthesis of paleoclimate evidence from northwest Greenland, Ellesmere Island and northern Baffin Bay supports the timing of temperature trends inferred at Deltaso, and suggests that quantitative temperature reconstructions from Deltas(?) may represent a minimum bound on regional early Holocene warming. Collectively, records from the region indicate >4 degrees C summer cooling through the Holocene. Intense early Holocene warmth around northwest Greenland argues against delayed onset of warmer than -present conditions due to the influence of the nearby waning Laurentide Ice Sheet, and has implications for understanding the Greenland Ice Sheet's sensitivity to climate change.

280,"Holocene temperature history at the western Greenland Ice Sheet margin reconstructed from lake sediments | Predicting the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to future climate change presents a major challenge to climate science. Paleoclimate data from Greenland can provide empirical constraints on past cryospheric responses to climate change, complementing insights from contemporary observations and from modeling. Here we examine sedimentary records from five lakes near Jakobshavn Isbrae in central West Greenland to investigate the timing and magnitude of major Holocene climate changes, for comparison with glacial geologic reconstructions from the region. A primary objective of this study is to constrain the timing and magnitude of maximum warmth during the early to middle Holocene positive anomaly in summer insolation. Temperature reconstructions from subfossil insect (chironomid) assemblages suggest that summer temperatures were warmer than present by at least 7.1 ka (the beginning of the North Lake record; ka = thousands of years before present), and that the warmest millennia of the Holocene occurred in the study area between 6 and 4 ka. Previous studies in the Jakobshavn region have found that the local Greenland Ice Sheet margin was most retracted behind its present position between 6 and 5 ka, and here we use chironomids to estimate that local summer temperatures were 2-3 degrees C warmer than present during that time of minimum ice sheet extent. As summer insolation declined through the late Holocene, summer temperatures cooled and the local ice sheet margin expanded. Gradual, insolation-driven millennial-scale temperature trends in the study area were punctuated by several abrupt climate changes, including a major transient event recorded in all five lakes between 4.3 and 3.2 ka, which overlaps in timing with abrupt climate changes previously documented around the North Atlantic region and farther afield at similar to 4.2 ka.

281,"Temperature and precipitation history of the Arctic | As the planet cooled from peak warmth in the early Cenozoic, extensive Northern Hemisphere ice sheets developed by 2.6 Ma ago, leading to changes in the circulation of both the atmosphere and oceans. From similar to 2.6 to similar to 1.0 Ma ago, ice sheets came and went about every 41 ka, in pace with cycles in the tilt of Earth's axis, but for the past 700 ka, glacial cycles have been longer, lasting 100 ka, separated by brief, warm interglaciations, when sea level and ice volumes were close to present. The cause of the shift from 41 ka to 100 ka glacial cycles is still debated. During the penultimate interglaciation, similar to 130 to similar to 120 ka ago, solar energy in summer in the Arctic was greater than at any time subsequently. As a consequence, Arctic summers were 5 degrees C warmer than at present, and almost all glaciers melted completely except for the Greenland Ice Sheet, and even it was reduced in size substantially from its present extent. With the loss of land ice, sea level was about 5 m higher than present, with the extra melt coming from both Greenland and Antarctica as well as small glaciers. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) peaked similar to 21 ka ago, when mean annual temperatures over parts of the Arctic were as much as 20 degrees C lower than at present. Ice recession was well underway 16 ka ago, and most of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets had melted by 6 ka ago. Solar energy reached a summer maximum (9% higher than at present) similar to 11 ka ago and has been decreasing since then, primarily in response to the precession of the equinoxes. The extra energy elevated early Holocene summer temperatures throughout the Arctic 1-3 degrees C above 20th century averages, enough to completely melt many small glaciers throughout the Arctic, although the Greenland Ice Sheet was only slightly smaller than at present. Early Holocene summer sea ice limits were substantially smaller than their 20th century average, and the flow of Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean was substantially greater. As summer solar energy decreased in the second half of the Holocene, glaciers re-established or advanced, sea ice expanded, and the flow of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean diminished. Late Holocene cooling reached its nadir during the Little Ice Age (about 1250-1850 AD), when sun-blocking volcanic eruptions and perhaps other causes added to the orbital cooling, allowing most Arctic glaciers to reach their maximum Holocene extent. During the warming of the past century, glaciers have receded throughout the Arctic, terrestrial ecosystems have advanced northward, and perennial Arctic Ocean sea ice has diminished. Here we review the proxies that allow reconstruction of Quaternary climates and the feedbacks that amplify climate change across the Arctic. We provide an overview of the evolution of climate from the hot-house of the early Cenozoic through its transition to the ice-house of the Quaternary, with special emphasis on the anomalous warmth of the middle Pliocene, early Quaternary warm times, the Mid Pleistocene transition, warm interglaciations of marine isotope stages 11, 5e, and 1, the stage 3 interstadial, and the peak cold of the last glacial maximum.

282,"Testate amoebae record from the Laptev Sea coast and its implication for the reconstruction of Late Pleistocene and Holocene environments in the Arctic Siberia | Our study aims to look for testate amobae (TA) in the surface and fossil sediments from the Cape Mamontov Klyk (73 degrees 60'-73 degrees 63' N, 116 degrees 88'-117 degrees 18' E), southern coast of the Laptev Sea, ca 150 km west of the Lena Delta and to discuss the potential of TA analysis for Glacial/Interglacial environmental reconstructions in Arctic Siberia. The radiocarbon age determination suggests that the studied sediments accumulated between ca 45,000 C-14 yr BP and present. A total of 98 TA taxa were identified in the 10 recent surface and 59 fossil samples. Results of taxonomical identification and ecological analysis of TA in the modern and fossil samples suggest that major changes in the soil moisture conditions took place. Our results show that soil-living taxa dominated the TA assemblages at the study sites during the past 45,000 years. The environmental conditions of the study area were most favourable (relatively warm and humid) during the Kargin Interstadial (ca 45,000-25,000 C-14 yr BP). An opposite situation is reconstructed for the Sartan Stadial (ca. 25,000-15,000 C-14 yr BP). During the Kargin Interstadial, optimum conditions occurred between ca 44,000 and 40,000 C-14 yr BP characterised by highest TA abundances and taxa diversity. This initial optimal phase was followed by the interval with drier and colder conditions about 40,000-30,000 C-14 yr BP. The sediments dated between ca. 24,000 and 18,000 C-14 yr BP show low TA abundances and diversity, in agreement with the much colder and drier environments during the maximum phase of the Last Glacial. The onset of the Holocene is indicated by a broad representation of obligate hydrophilic taxa, especially from genus Difflugia, suggesting wet and relatively warm conditions. By comparison with other environmental proxies used in the studied sections as well as from the neighbouring arctic regions our results suggest that TA analysis can provide valuable information, contributing to the better understanding of the Late Quaternary climate and environments in Arctic Siberia.

Thereafter, a gradual cooling brought temperatures to the present level at about 4.5 cal. ka BP.

We present quantitative summer temperature reconstructions from Lake Kharinei and lake Tumbulovaty, a previously studied lake in the same region, using a pollen-climate transfer function based on a new calibration set from northern European Russia. Our records suggest that the early-Holocene summer temperatures from 11,500 cal yr BP onwards were already slightly higher than at present, followed by a stable Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) at 8000-3500 cal yr BP when summer temperatures in the tundra were ca. 3 degrees C above present-day values. A Picea forest surrounded Lake Kharinei during the HTM, reaching 150 km north of the present taiga limit. The HIM ended with a temperature drop at 3500-2500 cal yr BP associated with permafrost initiation in the region. Mixed spruce forest began to disappear around lake Kharinei at ca. 3500 cal yr BP, with the last tree macrofossils recorded at ca. 2500 cal yr BP. suggesting that the present wide tundra zone in the Pechora region formed during the last ca. 3500 yr.

286,"Holocene thermal maximum in the western Arctic (0-180 degrees W) | The spatio-temporal pattern of peak Holocene warmth (Holocene thermal maximum, HTM) is traced over 140 sites across the Western Hemisphere of the Arctic (0-180degreesW; north of similar to60degreesN). Paleoclimate inferences based on a wide variety of proxy indicators provide clear evidence for warmer-than-present conditions at 120 of these sites. At the 16 terrestrial sites where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures (primarily summer estimates) were on average 1.6+/-0.8degreesC higher than present (approximate average of the 20th century), but the warming was time-transgressive across the western Arctic. As the precession-driven summer insolation anomaly peaked 12-10ka (thousands of calendar years ago), warming was concentrated in northwest North America, while cool conditions lingered in the northeast. Alaska and northwest Canada experienced the HTM between ca 11 and 9 ka, about 4000 yr prior to the HTM in northeast Canada. The delayed warming in Quebec and Labrador was linked to the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet, which chilled the region through its impact on surface energy balance and ocean circulation. The lingering ice also attests to the inherent asymmetry of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that predisposes the region to glaciation and modulates the pattern of climatic change. The spatial asymmetry of warming during the HTM resembles the pattern of warming observed in the Arctic over the last several decades. Although the two warmings are described at different temporal scales, and the HTM was additionally affected by the residual Laurentide ice, the similarities suggest there might be a preferred mode of variability in the atmospheric circulation that generates a recurrent pattern of warming under positive radiative forcing. Unlike the HTM, however, future warming will not be counterbalanced by the cooling effect of a residual North American ice sheet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

287,"Holocene Thermokarst Lake Dynamics in Northern Interior Alaska: The Interplay of Climate, Fire, and Subsurface Hydrology | The current state of permafrost in Alaska and meaningful expectations for its future evolution are informed by long-term perspectives on previous permafrost degradation. Thermokarst processes in permafrost landscapes often lead to widespread lake formation and the spatial and temporal evolution of thermokarst lake landscapes reflects the combined effects of climate, ground conditions, vegetation, and fire. This study provides detailed analyses of thermokarst lake sediments of Holocene age from the southern loess uplands of the Yukon Flats, including bathymetry and sediment core analyses across a water depth transect. The sediment core results, dated by radiocarbon and 210Pb, indicate the permanent onset of finely laminated lacustrine sedimentation by similar to 8,000 cal yr BP, which followed basin development through inferred thermokarst processes. Thermokarst expansion to modern shoreline configurations continued until similar to 5000 cal yr BP and may have been influenced by increased fire. Between similar to 5000 and 2000 cal yr BP, the preservation of fine laminations at intermediate and deep-water depths indicate higher lake levels than present. At that time, the lake likely overflowed into an over-deepened gully system that is no longer occupied by perennial streams. By similar to 2000 cal yr BP, a shift to massive sedimentation at intermediate water depths indicates that lake levels lowered, which is interpreted to reflect a response to drier conditions based on correspondence with Yukon Flats regional fire and local paleoclimate reconstructions. Consideration of additional contributing mechanisms include the possible influence of catastrophic lake drainages on down-gradient base-flow levels that may have enhanced subsurface water loss, although this mechanism is untested. The overall consistency between the millennial lake-level trends documented here with regional paleoclimate trends indicates that after thermokarst lakes formed, their size and depth has been affected by North Pacific atmospheric circulation in addition to the evolution of permafrost, ground ice, and subsurface hydrology. As the first detailed study of a Holocene thermokarst basin that links expansion, stabilization and subsequent climate- driven lake level variations in a loess upland, these results provide a framework for future investigations of paleoclimatic signals from similar lake systems that characterize large regions of Alaska and Siberia. | ['anderson', 'edward', 'finney', 'langdon', 'shapley'] | ","['anderson', 'edward', 'finney', 'langdon', 'shapley']",2
288,"Holocene thermokarst and pingo development in the Kolyma Lowland (NE Siberia) | Ground ice and sedimentary records of a pingo exposure reveal insights into Holocene permafrost, landscape and climate dynamics. Early to mid-Holocene thermokarst lake deposits contain rich floral and faunal paleoassemblages, which indicate lake shrinkage and decreasing summer temperatures (chironomid-based T-July) from 10.5 to 3.5 cal kyr BP with the warmest period between 10.5 and 8 cal kyr BP. Talik refreezing and pingo growth started about 3.5 cal kyr BP after disappearance of the lake. The isotopic composition of the pingo ice (delta O-18 - 17.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand, delta D -144.5 +/- 3.4 parts per thousand, slope 5.85, deuterium excess -7.7 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand) point to the initial stage of closed-system freezing captured in the record. A differing isotopic composition within the massive ice body was found (delta O-18 - 21.3 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand, delta D -165 +/- 11.5 parts per thousand, slope 8.13, deuterium excess 4.9 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand), probably related to the infill of dilation cracks by surface water with quasi-meteoric signature. Currently inactive syngenetic ice wedges formed in the thermokarst basin after lake drainage. The pingo preserves traces of permafrost response to climate variations in terms of ground-ice degradation (thermokarst) during the early and mid-Holocene, and aggradation (wedge-ice and pingo-ice growth) during the late Holocene. | ['bobrov', 'fritz', 'gunther', 'matthes', 'meyer', 'nazarova', 'opel', 'palagushkina', 'pogosyan', 'savelieva', 'schirrmeiste', 'syrykh', 'wetterich'] | ","['bobrov', 'fritz', 'gunther', 'matthes', 'meyer', 'nazarova', 'opel', 'palagushkina', 'pogosyan', 'savelieva', 'schirrmeiste', 'syrykh', 'wetterich']",0
289,"Timing and magnitude of early to middle Holocene warming in East Greenland inferred from chironomids | Much of Greenland experienced summers warmer than present in parts of the early to middle Holocene, during a precession-driven positive anomaly in summer insolation. However, the magnitude of that warmth remains poorly known, and its timing and spatial pattern are uncertain. Here we describe the first quantitative Holocene palaeotemperature reconstruction from central East Greenland based upon insect (chironomid) assemblages preserved in lake sediments. We postulate that landscapes like our study site, characterized by minimal soil and vegetation development through the Holocene and thus little influenced by some important secondary gradients, are especially well suited to the use of chironomids to reconstruct Holocene temperatures. The inferred timing of warmth at our study site near Scoresby Sund agrees well with other nearby evidence, including glacial geological reconstructions and temperatures inferred from precipitation isotopes at Renland ice cap, supporting the use of chironomids to reconstruct temperatures at this site. We infer highest temperatures from c. 10 to 5.5 ka, followed by gradual cooling after 5.5 ka and progressively colder and less productive conditions after 3.5 ka. Models based upon two independent training sets yield similar inferred temperature trends, and suggest an average summer temperature anomaly from c. 10 to 5.5 ka of 3 to 4 degrees C relative to the preindustrial last millennium. The estimated overall rate of Neoglacial cooling averaged over the period from 5.5 to 0.5 kawas 0.6 to 0.8 degrees C per thousand years, more than twice the rate previously estimated for the Arctic as awhole. Given strong apparent spatial variability in Holocene climate around the Arctic, and the utility of palaeoclimate data for improving climate and ice-sheet models, it should be a priority to further quantify past temperature changes around the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, where few quantitative reconstructions exist and future warming will affect global sea level. | ['axford', 'francis', 'hall', 'kelly', 'langdon', 'levy', 'lowell'] | ","['axford', 'francis', 'hall', 'kelly', 'langdon', 'levy', 'lowell']",4

291,"Transfer of ice algae carbon to ice-associated amphipods in the high-Arctic pack ice environment | Sympagic (ice-associated) amphipods channel carbon into the marine ecosystem. With Arctic sea ice extent in decline, it is becoming increasingly important to quantify this transfer of sympagic energy. Recently, a method for quantifying sympagic particulate organic carbon (iPOC) in filtered water samples was proposed based on the abundances of the Arctic sea ice biomarker IP25. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adoption of this method could also provide quantitative estimates of iPOC transfer within Arctic amphipods. We analysed five amphipod species collected north of Svalbard and compared findings to some previous studies. Estimates showed that Onisimus glacialis and Apherusa glacialis contained the most iPOC, relative to dry mass (23.5 +/- 4.5 and 9.8 +/- 1.9 mg C g(-1), respectively), while Gammarus wilkitzkii had the highest grazing impact on the available ice algae (0.48 mg C m(-2), for an estimated 24 h), equating to 73% of algal standing stock. Our findings are also broadly consistent with those obtained by applying the H-Print biomarker approach to the same samples. The ability to obtain realistic quantitative estimates of iPOC transfer into sympagic and pelagic fauna will likely have important implications for modelling energy flow in Arctic food webs during future climate scenarios. | ['assmy', 'belt', 'brown', 'hop', 'wold'] | ","['assmy', 'belt', 'brown', 'hop', 'wold']",4
292,"Time-transgressive early Holocene vegetational succession following shore displacement: a case study from central Sweden | Deglaciation took place in eastern Jamtland and Angermanland in central Sweden c. 10 500 - 10 200 cal. yr BP. In the present study, vegetation development and shore displacement during the earliest ice-free period are investigated by C-14 dating of sediment from six isolated lake basins and by pollen analysis. A brief but distinct peak in Hippophae ""occurs in all pollen diagrams coincident with basin isolation, followed by up to 500 years ( varying locally) by an Alnus rise. The Alnus curve does not display a synchronous rise in the area. Its expansion below the highest shore level is time-transgressive and controlled mainly by the timing of basin isolation. The relationship between regional Alnus expansion and changes in hydrology and climate is discussed. The pollen diagrams show Pinus predominance with Corylus to the east ( more coastal areas) and Betula predominance ( though less pronounced) to the west during the period 10 200 - 9000 cal. yr BP. However, comparisons between sites suggest marked variability in the forest development. Shore displacement in easternmost Jamtland c. 10 300 - 9000 cal. yr BP is equal to or slightly more rapid than that of SE Angermanland, contrary to the present pattern of isostatic recovery. A rapid shore level regression c. 10 300 - 10 000 cal. yr BP may be related to drainage of the Ancylus Lake. | ['berglund'] | ",['berglund'],0
293,"Time-transgressive environmental shifts across Northern Europe at the onset of the Younger Dryas | Until lately, it has commonly been assumed that the last major reorganization of the North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere system, the Younger Dryas climatic reversal, spread synchronously on continental to hemispheric scales. This assumption arose because reliable chronologies, which would allow capturing the complexity surrounding local responses to abrupt climate change, were lacking. To better understand the temporal structure at the inception of the Younger Dryas across the North Atlantic, we revised, updated and compared the chronological framework of four Northern European sediment sequences (Lake Krakenes, Lake Madtjarn, Lake Gammelmose, Sluggan Bog) by applying classical Bayesian modelling. We found distinct and spatially consistent age differences between the inferred ages of the Allerod interstadial - Younger Dryas stadial pollen zone boundaries among the four sites. Our results suggest an earlier vegetation response at sites along latitude 56-54 degrees N as compared to sites located at 60 -58 degrees N. We explain this time lag by a gradual regional cooling that started as early as c. 12,900 -13,100 cal. BP. This phenomenon was probably linked to cooling around the Nordic Seas as a result of enhanced iceberg calving from the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet during the final stage of the Aneroid inter-stadial. By contrast, vegetation shifts at sites located further north occurred significantly later and in concert with the establishment of full stadial climate conditions (c. 12,600-12,750 cal. BP). Our study emphasizes the need to develop solid regional C-14 chronologies and to employ the same age modelling approach to determine the temporal and spatial response to a climatic shift.

294,"Tree-ring-dated 'Little Ice Age' histories of maritime glaciers from western Prince William Sound, Alaska | Tree-ring studies at 13 glacier forefields in western Prince William Sound show 'Little Ice Age' glacial fluctuations were strongly synchronous on decadal timescales. Cross-dated glacially overrun trees at eight sites indicate ice margins advanced in the early (late twelfth through thirteenth centuries) and middle (seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries) 'Little Ice Age'. Tree-ring dates of 22 moraines at 13 glaciers show two main periods of stabilization. The earlier of these, in the first decades of the eighteenth century, overlaps with the second period of glaciers overrunning trees and marks culmination of this middle 'Little Ice Age' expansion. Stabilization of moraines on nine of the study forefields in the latter part of the nineteenth century delineates a third interval of 'Little Ice Age' glacial advance. The detailed 'Little Ice Age' record from land-terminating glaciers in western Prince William Sound is consistent on a timescale of decades with four other tree-ring-dated glacial histories from across the northern Gulf of Alaska. This coastal northeastern Pacific glacial record reveals the structure of the 'Little Ice Age' in the region and provides a strong basis for comparison with other proxy climate records spanning the past 1000 years. | ['barclay', 'calkin', 'wile'] | ","['barclay', 'calkin', 'wile']",1

296,"Trends in historical mercury deposition inferred from lake sediment cores across a climate gradient in the Canadian High Arctic | Recent climate change may be enhancing mercury fluxes to Arctic lake sediments, confounding the use of sediment cores to reconstruct histories of atmospheric deposition. Assessing the independent effects of climate warming on mercury sequestration is challenging due to temporal overlap between warming temperatures and increased long-range transport of atmospheric mercury following the Industrial Revolution. We address this challenge by examining mercury trends in short cores (the last several hundred years) from eight lakes centered on Cape Herschel (Canadian High Arctic) that span a gradient in microclimates, including two lakes that have not yet been significantly altered by climate warming due to continued ice cover. Previous research on subfossil diatoms and inferred primary production indicated the timing of limnological responses to climate warming, which, due to prevailing ice cover conditions, varied from similar to 1850 to similar to 1990 for lakes that have undergone changes. We show that climate warming may have enhanced mercury deposition to lake sediments in one lake (Moraine Pond), while another (West Lake) showed a strong signal of post-industrial mercury enrichment without any corresponding limnological changes associated with warming. Our results provide insights into the role of climate warming and organic carbon cycling as drivers of mercury deposition to Arctic lake sediments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

297,"Understanding Global Climate Change: Paleoclimate Perspective from the World's Highest Mountains | Glaciers are among the world's best recorders of, and first responders to, natural and anthropogenic climate change and provide a time perspective for current climatic and environmental variations. Over the last 50 years such records have been recovered from the polar regions as well as low-latitude, high-elevation ice fields. Analyses of these ice cores and of the glaciers from which they have been drilled have yielded three lines of evidence for past and present abrupt climate change: (1) the temperature and precipitation histories recorded in the glaciers as revealed by the climate records extracted from the ice cores; (2) the accelerating loss of the glaciers themselves; and (3) the uncovering of ancient fauna and flora from the margins of the glaciers as a result of their recent melting, thus illustrating the significance of the current ice loss. The current melting of high-altitude, low-latitude ice fields is consistent with model predictions for a vertical amplification of temperature in the tropics. The ongoing rapid retreat of the world's mountain glaciers, as well as the margins of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, is not only contributing to global sea level rise, but also threatening fresh-water supplies in many of the most populous regions. More recently, strong evidence has appeared for the acceleration of the rate of ice loss in the tropics, which especially presents a clear and present danger to water supplies for at-risk populations in South America and Asia. The human response to this issue, however, is not so clear, for although the evidence from both data and models becomes more compelling, the rate of global CO2 emissions continues to accelerate. Climatologically, we are in unfamiliar territory, and the world's ice cover is responding dramatically. The loss of glaciers, which can be viewed as the world's water towers, threatens water resources that are essential for hydroelectric power, crop irrigation, municipal water supplies, and even tourism. As these glaciers are disappearing, we are also losing very valuable paleoclimate archives. | ['thompson'] | ",['thompson'],1

Sedimentation rates were calculated based on the radioisotopes Pb-210 and Cs-137. Lithological, biogeochemical, and geochemical studies showed a low variability of the sedimentation conditions over the last 250 years. However, even small changes in microfossils, as well as lithological and geochemical parameters, make it possible to trace some short-term climate changes in this area, probably controlled by atmospheric circulation. The core shows a clear binomial structure, reflecting changes in sedimentation at the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and afterward. For the northern part of the East Novaya Zemlya Trough, low sea surface temperatures and an increase in the duration of ice cover at the end of the LIA in the 1780s-1810s have been reconstructed. Since the 1810s, the hydrodynamic activity of water masses intensified sharply due to glacier melting (especially after the 1840s). In addition, an increase in sea surface temperatures can be assumed, except for the cooling of the 1910s.

Palynological, macrofossil, loss-on-ignition, tephra and C-14 data from three sites at the northern part of the island of And circle divide ya were studied. The period 12 300-11 950 cal. yr BP was characterized by polar desert vegetation, and 11 950-11 050 cal. yr BP by a moisture-demanding predominantly low-arctic Oxyria vegetation. During the period 11 050-10 650 cal. yr BP, there was a climatic amelioration towards a sub-arctic climate and heaths dominated by Empetrum. After 10 650 cal. yr BP the Oxyria vegetation disappeared. As early as about 10 800 cal. yr BP the bryozoan Cristatella mucedo indicated a climate sufficient for Betula woodland. However, tree birch did not establish until 10 420-10 250 cal. yr BP, indicating a time-lag for the formation of Betula ecotypes adapted to the oceanic climate of And circle divide ya.

The records reveal the environmental history for the last ca 200 kyr. For interglacial pollen spectra, quantitative temperature values were estimated using the best modern analogue method. Sparse grass-sedge vegetation indicating arctic desert environmental conditions existed prior to 200 kyr ago. Dense, wet grass-sedge tundra habitats dominated during an interstadial ca 200-190 kyr ago, reflecting warmer and wetter summers than before. Sparser vegetation communities point to much more severe stadial conditions ca 190-130 kyr ago. Open grass and Artemisia communities with shrub stands (Alnus fruticosa, Salix, Betula nana) in more protected and moister places characterized the beginning of the Last Interglacial indicate climate conditions similar to present. Shrub tundra (Alnus fruticosa and Betula nana) dominated during the middle Eemian climatic optimum, when summer temperatures were 4-5 degrees C higher than today. Early-Weichselian sparse grass-sedge dominated vegetation indicates climate conditions colder and dryer than in the previous interval. Middle Weichselian Interstadial records indicate moister and warmer climate conditions, for example, in the interval 40-32 kyr BP Salix was present within dense, grass-sedge dominated vegetation. Sedge-grass-Artemisia-communities indicate that climate became cooler and drier after 30 kyr BP, and cold, dry conditions characterized the Late Weichselian, ca 26-16 kyr BP, when grass-dominated communities with Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Cichoriaceae, Selaginella rupestris were present. From 16 to 12 kyr BP, grass-sedge communities with Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, and Cichoriaceae indicate climate was significantly warmer and moister than during the previous interval. The presence of Salix and Betula reflect temperatures about 4 degrees C higher than present at about 12-11 kyr BP, during the Allerod interval, but shrubs were absent in the Younger Dryas interval, pointing to a deterioration of climate conditions. Alnus fruticosa, Betula nana, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae dominate early Holocene spectra. Reconstructed absolute temperature values were substantially warmer than present (up to 12 degrees C). Shrubs gradually disappeared from coastal areas after 7.6 kyr BP when vegetation cover became similar to modern.

As a result, environmental conditions right at the moment of deglaciation of the large N-Hemisphere ice-sheets remain largely unknown. Here we study three deglacial phases of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet as a unique, repeated element in a long sediment record preserved at Sokli in northern Finland. We summarize extensive multi-proxy data (diatoms, phytoliths, chironomids, pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, macrofossils, lithology, loss-on-ignition, C/N) obtained on glacial lake sediments dated to the early Holocene (ca. 10 kyr BP), early MIS 3 (ca. 50 kyr BP) and early MIS 5a (ca. 80 kyr BP). In contrast to the common view of an unproductive ice-marginal environment, our study reconstructs rich ecosystems both in the glacial lake and along the shores with forest on recently deglaciated land. Higher than present-day summer temperatures are reconstructed based on a large variety of aquatic taxa. Rich biota developed due to the insolation-induced postglacial warming and high nutrient levels, the latter resulting from erosion of fresh bedrock and sediment, leaching of surface soils, decay of plant material under shallow water conditions, and sudden decreases in lake volume. Aquatic communities responded quickly to deglaciation and warm summers and reflect boreal conditions, in contrast to the terrestrial ecosystem which responded with some delay probably due to time required for slow soil formation processes. Birch forest is reconstructed upon deglaciation of the large LGM ice-sheet and shrub tundra following the probably faster melting smaller MIS 4 and MIS 5b ice-sheets. Our study shows that glacial lake sediments can provide valuable palaeo-environmental data, that aquatic biota and terrestrial vegetation rapidly accommodated to new environmental conditions during deglaciation, and that glacial lake ecosystems, and the carbon stored in their sediments, should be included in earth system modeling. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V. | ['bos', 'engels', 'helmens', 'katrantsiotis', 'kuosmanen', 'luoto', 'luoto', 'ojala', 'risberg', 'sakari', 'salonen', 'shala', 'v√§liranta', 'weckstr√∂m'] | ","['bos', 'engels', 'helmens', 'katrantsiotis', 'kuosmanen', 'luoto', 'luoto', 'ojala', 'risberg', 'sakari', 'salonen', 'shala', 'v√§liranta', 'weckstr√∂m']",2
303,"Past Warmth and Its Impacts During the Holocene Thermal Maximum in Greenland | Higher boreal summer insolation in the early to middle Holocene drove thousands of years of summer warming across the Arctic. Modern-day warming has distinctly different causes, but geologic data from this past warm period hold lessons for the future. We compile Holocene temperature reconstructions from ice, lake, and marine cores around Greenland, where summer temperatures are globally important due to their influence on ice sheet mass balance, ocean circulation, and sea ice. Highlighting and accounting for some key issues with proxy interpretation, we find that much of Greenland experienced summers 3 to 5 degrees C warmer than the mid-twentieth century in the early Holocene-earlier and stronger warming than often presumed. Warmth had dramatic consequences: Many glaciers disappeared, perennial sea ice retreated, plants and animals migrated northward, the Greenland Ice Sheet shrank rapidly, and increased meltwater discharge led to strong marine water stratification and enhanced winter sea ice in some areas. Summer air temperatures and open ocean temperatures around much of Greenland peaked in the early Holocene in response to elevated summer insolation. Peak summer air temperatures ranged from 3 to 5 degrees C warmer than the mid-twentieth century in northwest and central Greenland to perhaps 1 to 2 degrees C warmer in south Greenland. Many differences between records can be explained by proxy seasonality, ice sheet elevation changes, vegetation analogs and lags, and the nearshore effects of ice sheet meltwater. Early Holocene warmth dramatically affected glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet; meltwater discharge, nearshore ocean salinity, and sea ice; and diverse flora and fauna. | ['axford', 'osterberg', 'de', 'vernal'] | ","['axford', 'osterberg', 'de', 'vernal']",2

We first analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of delta O-18(wc) in living willows growing at upland sites and found that over the last 30 years delta O-18(wc) values in individual growth rings correlate with local summer temperature and inter-annual variations in summer sea-ice extent. Deglacial delta O-18(wc) values from 145 samples of subfossil willows clearly record the Allerod warm period (similar to 13.2 ka), the Younger Dryas cold period (12.9-11.7 ka), and the Holocene Thermal Maximum (11.7-9.0 ka). The magnitudes of isotopic changes over these rapid climate oscillations were similar to 4.5 parts per thousand, which is about 60% of the differences in delta O-18(wc) between those willows growing during the last glacial period and today. Modeling of isotope-precipitation relationships based on Rayleigh distillation processes suggests that during the Younger Dryas these large shifts in 6180,c values were caused by interactions between local temperature and changes in evaporative moisture sources, the latter controlled by sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea. Based on these results and on the effects that sea-ice have on climate today, we infer that ocean-derived feedbacks amplified temperature changes and enhanced precipitation in coastal regions of Arctic Alaska during warm times in the past. Today, isotope values in willows on the North Slope of Alaska are similar to those growing during the warmest times of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, which were times of widespread permafrost thaw and striking ecological changes.

0,"Accurately ageing trees and examining their height-growth rates: Implications for interpreting forest dynamics | 1 We examined the validity of classifying tree species as early, mid-, or late-successional based on age and height-growth rates, by comparing the age and height-growth rates of trees in the boreal forest. 2 Age was first examined using the traditional method of coring 30 cm above the root collar; then dendrochronology was used to locate the root collar and missing annual growth rings. Traditional ageing differentially underestimates tree age; species classified as early successional (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Pinus banksiana) are less severely underestimated than those classified as mid- and late-successional (Picea glauca, Picea mariana, and Abies balsamea) (0-11 vs. 0-43 years), and also have relatively fewer locally missing growth rings. Ageing at the root collar shows that all tree species recruit within 5-10 years after fire and age cannot therefore be used to determine successional status. 3 Mean time taken to grow to each 1-m increment from the root collar was estimated for each species. Species classified as early successional have relatively higher growth rates between the root collar and the first metre; they are therefore less severely underestimated when aged above the root collar, explaining why they often appear older than species classified as mid- and late-successional. The lack of species differences above 1 m means that height-growth rates cannot be used to classify these tree species as early, mid-, or late-successional. 4 In the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, the rapid recruitment of all tree species after fire, and the short fire cycle mean that the forest dynamics between catastrophic wildfires are driven primarily by the mortality rates of each species. | ['gutsell', 'johnson'] | ","['gutsell', 'johnson']",3
1,"Age-dependent tree-ring growth responses of subarctic white spruce to climate | We test one of the fundamental assumptions of most dendroclimatological research, that the radial growth response of trees to climate does not vary with age once the biological growth trend has been removed. Picea glauca (Moench) Voss from three sites in the western Northwest Territories, Canada, are disaggregated into age-classes, and their response to climate examined through response function and linear regression analyses. These data are then used in multiple regression analyses to estimate June-July temperatures at Norman Wells, N.W.T., from 1909 to 1989 using both age-dependent and standard (age-independent) models. The response function and regression analyses suggest that the response of Picea glauca radial growth to climate differs between trees greater than 200 years old and less than 200 years old. These results suggest that the assumption of an age-invariate climate-growth function is therefore invalid at these sites. These apparent age-dependent responses are site specific and may reflect physiological changes related to aging. One possible causal factor of age dependence is that the trees are becoming increasingly moisture stressed with age owing to a reduction in the efficiency of water and nutrient translocation mechanisms. The estimation of June-July temperatures based on an age-dependent model produced improved calibration and verification statistics as compared with a reconstruction based on standard dendroclimatic modelling. If present, age-dependent climate-growth relationships may result in less accurate reconstructions of past climate, particularly during the early portions. However, age-dependent responses could also be used to increase the number of tree-ring based predictor variables for dendroclimatic reconstructions. | ['macdonald', 'szeicz'] | ","['macdonald', 'szeicz']",0
2,"Age-related growth and reproduction in Diapensia lapponica, an arctic-alpine cushion plant | Growth and flowering in an evergreen, cushion-forming, circumpolar, arctic-alpine plant, Diapensia lapponica, was followed for five years, 1990-1994, at the Latnjajaure Field Station, northern Swedish Lapland. This species is unusually suitable for age determination since plants grow radially from a central point of initiation. During the study period, the radial annual radial growth of cushions averaged 0.6 mm. The species exhibited a sigmoid pattern of growth in relation to the estimated age of cushions, and at least 400-year old plant individuals are present within the study area. Plants of Diapensia become reproductive at an average age of about 18 years, and may continue to flower for centuries. Recruitment to the seedling population takes place during cold periods (sequences of cold summers), and there is a negative correlation between recruitment and mean annual temperature in the Abisko area since 1913. The oldest stock of the present population at Latnjajaure was recruited during the Little Ice Age. | ['molau'] | ",['molau'],3
3,"Age-related trends in subfossil tree-ring delta C-13 data | Long stable isotope chronologies are increasingly constructed from tree rings. Averaging the mean chronologies necessitates that the contributing series contain no age-related trends. Therefore any set of dendroisotope data needs to be tested for age-dependency in isotope values before the chronology is compared with climate or other environmental records. Such age trends are common to tree-ringwidth and density data but corresponding evidence on stable isotope records is yet relatively limited. Moreover, there is contrasting evidence suggesting that while a number of dendroisotope datasets appear to portray no age-related trends, such trends may be found in different regions and tree species. Here we analyze a collection of 182 subfossil tree-ring delta C-13 series from a species (Pinus sylvestris) and a region (northern Fennoscandia) where previous investigations have found no support for age-related trends beyond the ""juvenile effect"" in the tree-ring delta C-13 data. Our delta C-13 dataset benefits from a large sample size of analysed tree rings representing a wide range of calendar years (5630 BC through AD 1930) formed under varying climate conditions. Our results indicate that the tree-ring d13C series do contain age-related trends throughout the trees' lifespan. This age-dependence corresponded to an ascending linear change of ca. 0.4 parts per thousand per 100 years. Illustrating the mean d13C curve as a function of trees' biological age demonstrated that the age-dependence may alternatively be modelled with non-linear trends with varying curvature. There were also time-variant changes in the d13C trend curvature of subfossil tree-ring data. Increasing and diminishing age-trend curvatures coincided with palaeoecological indications of denser and thinner pine populations, respectively, over the study period. Overall, our results highlight the hardships of detecting age-related trends in dendroisotope data, in comparison to records of tree-ring widths and densities. The possibility that age-related trends are present in dendroisotope data in regions and tree species where such trends may not yet have been detected is underlined. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

4,"Annual to decadal-scale variations in northwest Atlantic sector temperatures inferred from Labrador tree rings | Temperature-sensitive maximum latewood density chronologies from sites near tree line in Labrador are used to infer past changes in warm-season surface air and sea surface temperatures for the northwest Atlantic. Temperatures are reconstructed for the Grand Banks region based on density records from southern Labrador, while a density series from near Okak Fiord, northern Labrador, is used to infer past temperature variations for north-coastal Labrador and the adjacent Labrador Sea. The Labrador chronologies show good agreement with annual and decadal-scale temperature fluctuations over the recent period of instrumental record, and extend this temperature information into the past by several centuries. The lowest density value at the Okak site occurs in 1816, known as the ""year without a summer""' in eastern North America. Spectral analyses reveal statistically significant variations with periods of around 8.7, 18-22, and 45-66 years. These fluctuations are in general agreement with those identified in several instrumental and modeling analyses of North Atlantic climate. | ['cook', 'darrigo', 'jacoby'] | ","['cook', 'darrigo', 'jacoby']",3
5,"New Aspects of High-Mountain Palaeobiogeography: A Synthesis of Data from Forefields of Receding Glaciers and Ice Patches in the Tarna and Kebnekaise Mountains, Swedish Lapland | Recent recession of high-mountain glacier ice and perennial snow and ice patches has exposed megafossil and macrofossil tree remnants and peat, offering a new source of Holocene high alpine vegetation history in the Scandes. Radiocarbon dates of 90 tree megafossils from Swedish Lapland, 29 of which had not previously been published, range from 11 980 to 1950 cal yr BP. During the interval 9500-8500 cal yr BP, mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) grew 600-700 m higher upslope than they do today, which is a new and remarkable discovery. Subsequently, tree density gradually declined at higher elevations, and as the tree line moved downslope, the ratio of Betula to Pinus increased. Tree growth ceased around 4500 cal yr BP, presumably in response to the return of perennial ice and snow. A short episode of resumed tree growth of Betula indicates conditions warmer than present around 2000 years ago. Between c. 8500 and 7300 cal yr BP, Picea abies, Larix sibirica, Populus tremula, Sorbus aucuparia and Alnus incana were subordinate species on a forest floor dominated by plant species characteristic of prealpine or subalpine woodlands. Growth of trees as much as 700 m higher upslope than today around 9500 cal yr BP implies that summer temperatures at that time may have been 3.0 degrees C warmer than today's temperatures (corrected for land uplift). This inferred temperature difference between the early Holocene and the present concurs with changes in the Earth's orbital parameters. | ['kullman', 'oberg'] | ","['kullman', 'oberg']",3

Tree-ring data were used for a retrospective assessment of growth and state of forest stands. It was shown that the tree growth decrease began in the 1960s, and massive tree mortality began 10-15 years later. The main factors which caused the intensive forest degradation were the influence of phytotoxic pollutants, basically sulfur dioxide, and the cooling in summer months from the middle of the 1960s to the middle of the 1970s. | ['ivshin', 'shiyatov'] | ","['ivshin', 'shiyatov']",2
7,"Changes in atmospheric circulation and the Arctic Oscillation preserved within a millennial length reconstruction of summer cloud cover from northern Fennoscandia | Cloud cover currently represents the single greatest source of uncertainty in General Circulation Models. Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) from tree-rings, in areas of low moisture stress, are likely to be primarily controlled by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and therefore should provide a proxy record for cloud cover or sunshine; indeed this association has previously been demonstrated experimentally for Scots pine in Fennoscandia, with sunlight explaining ca 90% of the variance in photosynthesis and temperature only ca 4%. We present a statistically verifiable 1011-year reconstruction of cloud cover from a well replicated, annually-resolved delta C-13 record from Forfjord in coastal northwestern Norway. This reconstruction exhibits considerable variability in cloud cover over the past millennium, including extended sunny periods during the cool seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and warm cloudy periods during the eleventh, early fifteenth and twentieth centuries. We find that while a generally positive relationship persists between sunshine and temperature at high-frequency, at lower (multi-decadal) frequencies the relationship is more often a negative one, with cool periods being sunny (most notably the Little Ice Age period from 1600 to 1750 CE) and warm periods more cloudy (e.g. the mediaeval and the twentieth century). We conclude that these long-term changes may be caused by changes in the dominant circulation mode, likely to be associated with the Arctic Oscillation. There is also strong circumstantial evidence that prolonged periods of high summer cloud cover, with low PAR and probably high precipitation, may be in part responsible for major European famines caused by crop failures. | ['demmler', 'gagen', 'kirchhefer', 'loader', 'mccarroll', 'young'] | ","['demmler', 'gagen', 'kirchhefer', 'loader', 'mccarroll', 'young']",3
8,"A Model-Based Approach to Climate Reconstruction Using Tree-Ring Data | Quantifying long-term historical climate is fundamental to understanding recent climate change. Most instrumentally recorded climate data are only available for the past 200 years, so proxy observations from natural archives are often considered. We describe a model-based approach to reconstructing climate defined in terms of raw tree-ring measurement data that simultaneously accounts for nonclimatic and climatic variability. In this approach, we specify a joint model for the tree-ring data and climate variable that we fit using Bayesian inference. We consider a range of prior densities and compare the modeling approach to current methodology using an example case of Scots pine from Tornetrask, Sweden, to reconstruct growing season temperature. We describe how current approaches translate into particular model assumptions. We explore how changes to various components in the model-based approach affect the resulting reconstruction. We show that minor changes in model specification can have little effect on model fit but lead to large changes in the predictions. In particular, the periods of relatively warmer and cooler temperatures are robust between models, but the magnitude of the resulting temperatures is highly model dependent. Such sensitivity may not be apparent with traditional approaches because the underlying statistical model is often hidden or poorly described.

9,"Biases in RCS tree ring chronologies due to sampling heights of trees | The Regional Curve Standardization (RCS) is one of the most employed standardization methods to remove biological signals in long tree ring chronologies. The approach assumes that an overall age-related growth trend typify all tree ring series to be included in a standardized tree ring chronology. Although several potential problems of the method have been examined, the influence of varying the sampling height along tree stems has not been evaluated. Considering that age-related growth trends may vary with stem height, biases may arise when combining samples from unknown or variable sampling heights, a frequent situation with subfossil logs. In this study we perform a detailed stem analysis of 15 lakeshore black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. B.S.P.) trees in the taiga of eastern Canada to describe how the age-related growth trend varies with stem height and evaluate associated biases in RCS chronologies built from living and subfossil trees. Results show that the age-related growth trends vary markedly and systematically along stems, potentially generating large methodological biases in RCS chronologies, especially near the recent chronology end. These biases may lead to erroneous reconstructions of recent climatic trends and cause false divergence between tree ring and climate series. We have developed a correction procedure that appears efficient in removing these biases from chronologies built with the lakeshore trees and associated subfossil logs. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

10,"Two centuries-long dendroclimatic reconstruction based on Low Arctic Betula pubescens from Tromso Region, Northern Norway | This study presents the results of dendrochronological and dendroclimatological research of Betula pubescens from four sites in northern Norway (Kvaloya Island, Tromsoya Island and Storelva Valley), which provided a 193-year chronology. Our results highlight the importance of the site selection in dendroclimatological studies. We demonstrated that activity of geomorphic processes connected with local topography could led to reduced strength of climatic signal embedded in tree-ring data. Negative pointer years, triggered mainly by unfavourable climatic conditions and insect outbreaks, were common for all site chronologies in 1945, 1955, 1965, 1975, 1986, 2004. However, some site-specific differences were also distinguished. Response function analysis confirmed that June, July and August temperatures were positively correlated with tree-ring widths. This climate-growth relationship was stable throughout the years 1925-2000. From summer temperature reconstruction back to AD 1820, two colder (c. 1835-1850 and 1890-1920) and two warmer (c. 1825-1835 and 1920-1940) periods were identified. The tree-ring record from the Tromso Region, well correlated between series, sites and climate variables, is an important element of a large-scale reconstruction of pre-instrumental climate variation in the northeastern part of the Atlantic Ocean. Our dendroclimatic reconstruction corresponds well with other climate proxy data, like fluctuations of mountain glaciers in Scandinavia or sea ice extent. | ['migala', 'opala', 'owczarek'] | ","['migala', 'opala', 'owczarek']",2

While we agree with many of their recommendations, based on the results of other work, we think their paper is unnecessarily pessimistic regarding the ability of existing chironomid-based temperature inference models to provide reliable estimates of past temperature. We offer a critique of the main points discussed by Velle et al.

It presents results from research carried out during the period 1992-2001, when both the geographical and chronological extension of tree-ring data were greatly improved. Research projects are presently being carried out in nearly all the main forest land areas of the Subarctic and Subantarctic zones, outside the traditional regions of research in North America and Europe, and about 150 tree-ring chronologies over 1000 years in length have been developed. Special attention is paid to data from Southern Europe and the Mediterranean area, where a detailed temperature reconstruction has been completed back to A.D. 970. Research carried out in Italy and France provides useful information on climate change and CO2. The aim of this research consists of evaluating whether in the radial tree growth of recent decades, there might be a part unexplained by climate and due directly to increasing atmospheric CO2 fertilisation. These studies show that many wooden species in various ecosystems show different responses of ring width to increasing atmospheric CO2. Finally, new scenarios of vegetation distribution and carbon sequestering, due both to positive or negative response from the trees, are offered by studies that reconstruct the expected radial growth of trees in situations of atmospheric CO2 doubling.

17,"Climate change evidence in tree growth and stand productivity at the upper treeline ecotone in the Polar Ural Mountains | Background Recent warming is affecting species composition and species areal distribution of many regions. However, although most treeline studies have estimated the rates of forest expansion into tundra, still little is known about the long-term dynamic of stand productivity at the forest-tundra intersection. Here, we make use of tree-ring data from 350 larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) and spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) sampled along the singular altitudinal treeline ecotone at the Polar Urals to assess the dynamic of stand establishment and productivity, and link the results with meteorological observations to identify the main environmental drivers. Results The analysis of stand instalment indicated that more than 90% of the living trees appeared after 1900. During this period, the stand became denser and moved 50 m upward, while in recent decades the trees of both species grew faster. The maximum afforestation occurred in the last decades of the twentieth century, and the large number of encountered saplings indicates that the forest is still expanding. The upward shift coincided with a slight increase of May-August and nearly doubling of September-April precipitation while the increase in growth matched with an early growth season warming (June + 0.27 degrees C per decade since 1901). This increase in radial growth combined with the stand densification led to a 6-90 times increase of biomass since 1950. Conclusion Tree-ring based twentieth century reconstruction at the treeline ecotone shows an ongoing forest densification and expansion accompanied by an increased growth. These changes are driven by climate change mechanism, whereby the leading factors are the significant increase in May-June temperatures and precipitation during the dormant period. Exploring of phytomass accumulation mechanisms within treeline ecotone is valuable for improving our understanding of carbon dynamics and the overall climate balance in current treeline ecosystems and for predicting how these will be altered by global change. | ['devi', 'galimova', 'grigoriev', 'kukarskih', 'mazepa'] | ","['devi', 'galimova', 'grigoriev', 'kukarskih', 'mazepa']",2

19,"Climate change and the northern Russian treeline zone | The Russian treeline is a dynamic ecotone typified by steep gradients in summer temperature and regionally variable gradients in albedo and heat flux. The location of the treeline is largely controlled by summer temperatures and growing season length. Temperatures have responded strongly to twentieth-century global warming and will display a magnified response to future warming. Dendroecological studies indicate enhanced conifer recruitment during the twentieth century. However, conifers have not yet recolonized many areas where trees were present during the Medieval Warm period (ca AD 800-1300) or the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; ca 10 000-3000 years ago). Reconstruction of tree distributions during the HTM suggests that the future position of the treeline due to global warming may approximate its former Holocene maximum position. An increased dominance of evergreen tree species in the northern Siberian forests may be an important difference between past and future conditions. Based on the slow rates of treeline expansion observed during the twentieth century, the presence of steep climatic gradients associated with the current Arctic coastline and the prevalence of organic soils, it is possible that rates of treeline expansion will be regionally variable and transient forest communities with species abundances different from today's may develop. | ['beilman', 'kremenetski', 'macdonald'] | ","['beilman', 'kremenetski', 'macdonald']",0
20,"Climate sensitivity is affected by growth differentiation along the length of Juniperus communis L. shrub stems in the Ural Mountains | Arctic and alpine shrubs are valuable for future dendro-ecological and dendro-climatological studies in regions where trees are sparse or absent. A commonly accepted procedure of sampling shrub stem disks is at the root collar. However many shrub studies report low inter-series correlations in radial measurements as compared to trees. Many studies also report cross-dating difficulties with radial measurements from shrubs within a stand and commonly attribute this to differential growth along the length of the stem. So does one stem disk entirely represent the environmental parameters the shrub might be reacting to? Does change in sampling location of the stem disk affect the subsequent ring-width chronologies and climate sensitivity? To tackle these questions, we investigated Juniperus communis L. - a species wide spread in the circumpolar arctic - across a latitudinal gradient in the Ural Mountains. Based on traditional radial ring-width measurements we assessed growth synchronicity along the length of shrub stems. We also compared ring width chronologies representing different stem heights with respect to their relationships with temperature and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Growth patterns often varied significantly among stems disks of the same shrubs, resulting in dissimilar climate-growth relationships of stem disk chronologies. For correlations with temperature, stem disks at 20 cm distance from the root collar captured the best signal. For correlations with SPEI data we could not find any specific stem disk chronology with highest sensitivity. At least in our dataset, no ""perfect sampling height"" with high climate sensitivity exists and our results thus highlight that a single stem disk from a shrub may not completely represent the shrub's growth response to climate parameters. | ['bura', 'shetti', 'smiljanic', 'wilmking'] | ","['bura', 'shetti', 'smiljanic', 'wilmking']",2
21,"Climate signal age effects in boreal tree-rings: Lessons to be learned for paleoclimatic reconstructions | Age-related alternation in the sensitivity of tree-ring width (TRW) to climate variability has been reported for different forest species and environments. The resulting growth-climate response patterns are, however, often inconsistent and similar assessments using maximum latewood density (MXD) are still missing. Here, we analyze climate signal age effects (CSAE, age-related changes in the climate sensitivity of tree growth) in a newly aggregated network of 692 Pinus sylvestris L TRW and MXD series from northern Fennoscandia. Although summer temperature sensitivity of TRW (r(All) = 0.48) ranges below that of MXD (r(All) = 0.76), it declines for both parameters as cambial age increases. Assessment of CSAE for individual series further reveals decreasing correlation values as a function of time. This declining signal strength remains temporally robust and negative for MXD, while age-related trends in TRW exhibit resilient meanderings of positive and negative trends. Although CSAE are significant and temporally variable in both tree-ring parameters, MXD is more suitable for the development of climate reconstructions. Our results indicate that sampling of young and old trees, and testing for CSAE, should become routine for TRW and MXD data prior to any paleoclimatic endeavor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

22,"Climate signals in tree-ring width, density and delta C-13 from larches in Eastern Siberia (Russia) | We present the first and longest (413 years) dataset on stable carbon isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose (delta C-13), tree-ring width (TRW), and maximum latewood density (MXD) obtained from larch trees growing on permafrost under continental climate in the Suntar Khayata mountain ridge in Eastern Siberia (Russia). With this first study we calibrate tree-ring parameters against climate quantities, and based on these results assess the potential added value of MXD and especially of delta C-13 complementing TRW analysis for future climate reconstruction purposes. delta C-13 chronologies were corrected for human induced changes in atmospheric CO2 since AD 1800. Two different approaches were compared i) a correction referring merely to the decline in atmospheric delta C-13 (delta C-13(atm)) and ii) a correction additionally accounting for the increase in atmospheric partial pressure of CO2. delta C-13 chronologies are characterized by strong signal strength with only 4 trees representing the population signal at the site (mean inter-series correlation = 0.71 and EPS = 0.90). delta C-13 variation shows low similarity to TRW and MXD, while correlation between TRW and MXD is highly significant. Correlation analysis of tree-ring parameters with gridded instrumental data (Climate Research Unit, CRU TS 2.1) over the AD 1929-2000 calibration period demonstrates that TRW and MXD react as reported from other sites at cold and humid northern latitudes: precipitation plays no significant role, but strong dependencies on monthly mean, maximum and minimum temperatures, particularly of the current summer (June to August), are found (up to r=0.60, p<0.001). Combining instrumental data to a summer season mean (JJA) and TRW and MXD to a growth parameter mean (TRW+MXD), clearly shows the importance of the number of frost days and minimum temperatures during summer (r=0.67, p <0.001) to dominate tree growth and highlights the potential for climate reconstruction. Carbon isotope fixation in tree rings is obviously less controlled by temperature variables. In particular, the frost days and minimum temperature have a much smaller influence on delta C-13 than on tree growth. delta C-13 strongly reacts to current-year July precipitation (r=-0.44, p<0.05) and June-July maximum temperature (r=0.46, p<0.001). All significant (p<0.05) correlation coefficients are higher when using the corrected delta C-13 chronology considering an additional plant physiological response on increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, than using the chronology corrected for delta C-13(atm) changes alone. Spatial distribution of correlations between tree-ring data and climate variables for Eastern Siberia indicates that the summer temperature regime in the studied region is mostly influenced by Arctic air masses, but precipitation in July seems to be brought out from the Pacific region. Both the combined TRW+MXD record and the (513 C record revealed a high reconstruction potential for summer temperature and precipitation, respectively, particularly on decadal and longer-term scales.

23,"How do climate and topography influence the greening of the forest-tundra ecotone in northern Quebec? A dendrochronological analysis of Betula glandulosa | NDVI analysis and repeated aerial photographs have revealed significant shrub expansion in many subarctic regions. While the recent increase in temperature is usually considered to be the main driver of this phenomenon at regional scales, very little is known about the local heterogeneity of shrub responses across the landscape. In this study, we aim to identify the climatic factors controlling the growth of the largely distributed shrub species Betula glandulosa in three types of environments (terrace, hilltop and snowbed). We also aim to evaluate the relationship between B.glandulosa growth and the NDVI data for the Boniface River region, in north-western Quebec, where the study took place. In the field, we harvested 180 B.glandulosa individuals (20 per site, 3 sites per type of environment). We constructed specific growth-ring width chronologies and mean axial growth rate chronologies for each site and used them for dendroclimatic analysis (response functions). We also used linear regressions to evaluate the relative influence of dwarf birch growth on the NDVI trend. We found a sharp increase in B.glandulosa radial growth in the 1990s followed by a sharp decreasing trend from 2002 on terraces and hilltops, while growth remained high in snowbeds. Betula glandulosa growth was positively correlated with summer temperatures on terraces and hilltops, whereas winter precipitation promoted growth on snowbeds. The NDVI trend was largely correlated to B.glandulosa growth on terraces and hilltops for the period between 1986 and 2002 (71-80% explained variance).Synthesis. Our results suggest that topography plays a major role in B.glandulosa growth and therefore in shrub community dynamics. Because terraces and hilltops represent 70% of the land surface, the sharp B.glandulosa growth increase at these sites promoted an important overall expansion of the shrub community in the region. However, the decline in B.glandulosa growth observed after 2002 suggests that the expansion could be slowed down in the near future, therefore limiting shrub growth contribution to the regional NDVI signal. | ['boudreau', 'levesque', 'ropars'] | ","['boudreau', 'levesque', 'ropars']",3
24,"A 538-year record of climate and treeline dynamics from the lower Lena River region of Northern Siberia, Russia | A 538-yr tree-ring chronology and reconstruction of June temperatures were developed from living and dead Larix dahurica trees. The samples were obtained near the lower Lena River in northern Siberia. Dendrochronological techniques were used to estimate the ages of establishment and mortality of Larix dahurica on the presently treeless uplands and to determine the establishment dates of living trees in the lowlands. The 20th century may have experienced the greatest prolonged period of high June temperatures over the past 538 yr. In contrast the greatest prolonged period of cold appears to have occurred during the first half of the 19th century. It was during the 19th century that the uplands lost much of their tree and soil cover. Recruitment of trees occurred in the lowlands during the 20th century, but trees have not been able to recolonize the uplands, possibly due to the lack of suitable soil. | ['case', 'macdonald', 'szeicz'] | ","['case', 'macdonald', 'szeicz']",2
25,"Climate variability and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks in south-central and southwest Alaska | We used tree ring data (AD 1601-2007) to examine the occurrence of and climatic influences on spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks in south-central and southwest Alaska and found evidence of regional-scale outbreaks dating from the mid-1700s, related to climate variability at multiple temporal scales. Over interannual time scales (similar to 1-3 years), El Nino years, combined with severe late-summer drought, appeared to contribute significantly to spruce beetle outbreaks in the study area. Over multidecadal time scales (up to similar to 40 years), cool-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) conditions tended to precede beetle outbreaks, regardless of the phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). All sites showed low-severity disturbances attributed to spruce beetle damage, most notably during the 1810s. During other major periods of disturbance (i.e., 1870s, 1910s, 1970s), the effects of spruce beetle outbreaks were of moderate or higher severity. The highly synchronized timing of spruce beetle outbreaks at interannual to multidecadal scales, and particularly the association between cool-phase PDO conditions and beetle disturbance, suggests that climate (i.e., temperature, precipitation) is a primary driver of outbreaks in the study area. Our disturbance chronologies (mid-1700s to present) suggest that recent irruptions (1990s to present) in south-central and southwest Alaska are within the historical geographic range, but that outbreaks since the 1990s show greater spatiotemporal synchrony (i.e., more sites record high-severity infestations) than at any other time in the past similar to 250 years. | ['berg', 'miller', 'sherriff'] | ","['berg', 'miller', 'sherriff']",3
26,"Climatic effects on birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) growth in Fnjoskadalur valley, northern Iceland | This paper presents the results of a dendrochronological and dendroclimatological study of birch growth in northern Iceland. Two cores from 36 trees were extracted at two locations and a 110-year-long chronology was built, which is near the maximum possible chronology length for living trees in the study area, considering the growing conditions in Iceland and the history of forest management. Birch has a very good dendroclimatological potential. Pointer year analysis indicates that above-average summer temperature and above-average snowpack result in a positive pointer year (wide ring), while below-average summer temperature and a dry winter result in a negative pointer year (narrow ring). Bootstrapped response functions confirm that June and July above-average temperature positively influences tree-ring width. This climate/growth relationship is stable throughout the 1930-2002 period. Yet the influence of above-average temperature is slightly more important in June than in July. It turned out that birch tree rings are challenging to work with in dendrochronology, considering that their boundaries are difficult to distinguish. Moreover, frequent early summer frosts, insect attacks, and sheep grazing affect birch wood formation and development of tree rings in Iceland, making dendrochronological work even harder.

27,"The climatic interpretation of pan-European signature years in oak ring-width series | Large-scale signature years, in which oak growth across much of northern Europe varies consistently. are identified. Postulating that the likely cause of such widespread departures in growth is climatic, it is shown that these years were characterized by pan-European anomalies in soil-moisture availability, rainfall and temperature, with enhanced growth associated with an extended period of increased soil-moisture availability and reduced -rowth associated with lower temperatures and reduced soil moisture, These climatic anomalies are, in turn, associated with a large-scale and persistent perturbation in the atmospheric circulation that involves the circumpolar vortex and appears related to the Arctic Oscillation. The 2000-year record of signature-year occurrence shows variations in frequency at the decadal and century levels, It is necessary to interpret this record with caution. Nevertheless, these results do confirm earlier suggestions that large-scale climatic information is contained in regional composite archaeological chronologies. With supporting evidence from other sources, it should be possible to extract useful proxy climate data, even though the precise provenance of the timbers from which the records were derived might not be known. | ['briffa', 'harris', 'kelly', 'leuschner'] | ","['briffa', 'harris', 'kelly', 'leuschner']",3
28,"Climatic responses of tree-ring widths of Larix gmelinii on contrasting north-facing and south-facing slopes in central Siberia | An analysis was performed on the climatic responses of the radial growth of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr. on contrasting north-facing and south-facing slopes in Tura, central Siberia. We developed chronologies of tree-ring width for four plots, designated as north-upper, northlower, south-upper, and south-lower. Both residual and standard chronologies of tree-ring widths exhibited a significant positive correlation with temperature from the end of May until early June in all four plots. The chronologies of ring width did not reveal any major difference in the response to temperature among the four plots. The standard chronologies of ring widths on the north-facing slope were negatively correlated with precipitation during the winter (October-April) and in early and mid-May, whereas the residual chronologies did not reveal clear relationships with precipitation during the winter and May. The significant correlation between ring width and temperature from the end of May until early June indicates that temperatures in springtime play a significant role in the radial growth of L. gmelinii. The negative correlations between standard chronologies of tree-ring width and precipitation in the winter and in May on the north-facing slope indicate that lowfrequency fluctuations in snowfall have negative effects on the radial growth. However, these effects vary and depend on the microscale topography. | ['abaimov', 'kajimoto', 'koike', 'kujansuu', 'matsuura', 'takeda', 'tokumoto', 'yasue'] | ","['abaimov', 'kajimoto', 'koike', 'kujansuu', 'matsuura', 'takeda', 'tokumoto', 'yasue']",0
29,"Climatic signals in delta C-13 and delta O-18 of Tree-rings from White Spruce in the Mackenzie Delta Region, Northern Canada | Here we present the First tree-ring series (1850-2003) of stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope ratios from a high-latitude treeline site in northwestern Canada. Both delta C-13 and delta O-18 were measured at annual resolution from whole-ring-alpha-cellulose of three white spruce trees (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) growing in the Mackenzie Delta. There is a strong positive association between delta C-13 and maximum summer temperatures. This relation likely results from the influence of temperature-induced drought stress on stomatal conductance. Mean summer relative humidity is also significantly correlated, inversely, with delta C-13 reflecting its direct influence on stomatal conductance. The delta O-18 record is strongly and positively correlated with early-spring to mid-summer minimum temperatures likely owing to the temperature dependence of delta O-18 in precipitation and uptake of this water during the growing season. Mean summer relative humidity is also significantly and inversely correlated with delta O-18 due to leaf water evaporative enrichment. Our delta C-13 and delta O-18 records contain a large amount of climate-driven variability indicating their considerable potential to infer past climate changes in the Mackenzie Delta region. | ['edward', 'kokelj', 'pisaric', 'porter'] | ","['edward', 'kokelj', 'pisaric', 'porter']",3

31,"Climatogenetic Response of Pine Trees in Southern Tomsk Oblast | The effect of temperature and precipitation was studied on pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) radial increment in pine forests in southern Tomsk Oblast, West Siberia, Russia. The most tree ring width is produced by the lower temperatures in the growing season, the higher winter and spring temperatures and the higher summer precipitation in the current hydrological year. The positive correlation between the ring width and the higher spring and summer (since April till July) precipitation and the negative correlation between the width and the higher winter (since December till January) precipitation are found during winters with less snow cover. During the last century (1900-2000) the tree radial increment significantly depends on April and September temperatures and June precipitation in all pine forests studied and is satisfactory explained by seasonal patterns of physiological and growth activity of pine trees and by seasonal changes of soil climate in southern West Siberian Plain. –ò–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–æ –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ —Å–æ—Å–Ω—ã (Pinus sylvestris L.) –≤ —Å—É—Ö–æ–¥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ—Å–Ω—è–∫–∞—Ö —é–≥–∞ –¢–æ–º—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏. –ü—Ä–∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–º —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –ø–æ —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω–∞–º –≥–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è —à–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∏ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –Ω–∏–∑–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö –≤–µ–≥–µ—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ –∏ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏—Ö —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö –∑–∏–º—ã –∏ –≤–µ—Å–Ω—ã –∏ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–º –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –ª–µ—Ç–∞ (–≤ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–º –∏—é–Ω—è) —Ç–µ–∫—É—â–µ–≥–æ –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ–¥–∞. –í –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –º–∞–ª–æ—Å–Ω–µ–∂–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–∏–º —É—Å–∏–ª–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä–æ–ª—å –≤—ã–ø–∞–¥–∞—é—â–∏—Ö –≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π –∏ –ª–µ—Ç–æ–º –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ (–∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—å-–∏—é–ª—å) –≤ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞ –∫—Å–∏–ª–µ–º—ã –∏ –æ—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä–æ–ª—å –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –¥–µ–∫–∞–±—Ä—è-—è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è —Ç–µ–∫—É—â–µ–≥–æ –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ–¥–∞. –í —Ü–µ–ª–æ–º –∑–∞ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–π –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ (1900-2000 –≥–≥.) —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ —Å–æ—Å–Ω—ã –æ–±—ã–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–º–æ –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏—Ç –æ—Ç —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è –∏ —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è –∏ –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –∏—é–Ω—è –≤–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ö –æ–±—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—É—Ö–æ–¥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ—Å–Ω—è–∫–∞—Ö –∏ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º–∏ –µ–µ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∏ —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–æ–π –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —Å–µ–∑–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ –ø–æ—á–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —é–≥–µ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ-–°–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏–Ω—ã. | ['nikolaeva', 'savchuk'] | ","['nikolaeva', 'savchuk']",4

33,"A coherent postglacial tree-limit chronology (Pinus Sylvestris L.) for the Swedish Scandes: Aspects of paleoclimate and ""recent warming,"" based on megafossil evidence | A coherent elevational tree-limit chronology, based on megafossil wood of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine), is presented for the entire Holocene period in the Swedish Scandes. The chronology is argued, on the basis of a close modern tree-limit/ climate relationship, to describe quite sensitively the secular-millennial course of summer temperature variations. Pinus had immigrated to the Scandes by about 11,700 BP (ca. 13,800 cal BP), which is much earlier than previously believed. The highest pine limit position, relative to the present day, was attained about 9400 BP (ca. 10,700 cal BP). Subsequently, it has descended gradually by ca. 500 m up to the present. This permanent state of unidirectional flux compares well with the Milankovitch model of orbital climate forcing, prescribing an early Holocene thermal optimum, successively turning into a stage with cooler summers. Prior to ca. 8000 BP, the rate of tree-limit recession was higher than later on, which is explained by additional cooling originating from particularly large glacioisostatic land uplift before this break point. Apart from the smooth long-term thermal decline and a few minor excursions (brief warmings and coolings), the Holocene climate appears to have been fairly stable. There are no indications of millennial-scale and large-amplitude climatic cycles. The virtually unbroken postglacial cooling, consistent with the predictive mechanism of orbital forcing, makes us hypothesize that this trend could be projected into the future, given that only natural climate mechanisms were operative. In such a perspective, the warm 20th century (and its high pine limit) stands out as an anomaly. Possibly, it signals some anthropogenic climate forcing, although contributory natural mechanisms cannot be precluded. The earliest megafossil dates originate from high mountain peaks during a period when traditional glacial models envisage that the Scandes and large areas to the east, south, and north were still covered by the extensive and entirely continuous Weichselian ice sheet. Thus, it appears that the biogeographic and deglaciation history of the Scandes is more complicated than previously understood. | ['kj√§illgren', 'kullman'] | ","['kj√§illgren', 'kullman']",3
34,"Common temperature signal in four well-replicated tree growth series from northern Fennoscandia | Four Nordic temperature proxies based on tree growth at the northern timberline ring-width from Sweden and Finland, maximum latewood density from Sweden, and height increment from Finland were compared. Three indexing methods were used to enhance the low (centennial and above), medium (decadal-to-multidecadal) and high (decadal-to-interannual) frequencies. The proxies are shown to have a strong temperature signal (common variance) at the interannual-to-multidecadal scale, while the multidecadal-to-centennial trends are less coherent, perhaps reflecting intra-regional differences in growing conditions but more likely due to the more noisy regional curve standardization method used to retain the longest trends. Various methods of combining the four proxy series were explored and tested by comparison with four long temperature records from northern Fennoscandia. Only relatively high-frequency, spline-indexed series produced consistently positive verification statistics as a reconstruction model for summer temperature using all four proxies.

The reconstructed annual growth increments were used to compare growth variability in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Spatiotemporal comparison of the growth records showed statistically significant correlation during the 19th century A.D., indicative of ecosystemindependent response to pre-anthropogenic climate variations. Geographical correlation between marine and terrestrial records was only observed at the local scale. Years with particularly low winter or high summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices showed the best synchronization of marine and terrestrial growth. Despite strong correlation during historical time, our palaeoecological evidence suggests that marine and terrestrial ecosystems may show dissimilar growth reaction to recently observed positive winter-NAO phases.

37,"A critical evaluation of multi-proxy dendroclimatology in northern Finland | Twentieth-century summer (July-August) temperatures in northern Finland are reconstructed using ring widths, maximum density and stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) of Scots pine tree rings, and using combinations of these proxies. Verification is based on the coefficient of determination (r(2)), reduction of error (RE) and coefficient of efficiency (CE) statistics. Of the individual proxies, delta C-13 performs best, followed by maximum density. Combining delta C-13 and maximum density strengthens the climate signal but adding ring widths leads to little improvement. Blue intensity, an inexpensive alternative to X-ray densitometry, is shown to perform similarly. Multi-proxy reconstruction of summer temperatures from a single site produces strong correlations with gridded climate data over most of northern Fennoscandia.

38,"Dating of snow avalanches by means of wound-induced vessel anomalies in sub-arctic Betula pubescens | Dendrogeomorphic research has long relied on scarred trees to reconstruct the frequency of mass-movement processes. Injuries have mostly been dated macroscopically by counting the tree rings formed after wounding. Tree-ring anatomical anomalies induced by cambial injury, in contrast, have only recently been recognized as proxy records of past events. We investigated 12 sub-arctic downy birch (Betula pubescensEhrh.) trees scarred by snow avalanches in Norway and Iceland. Earlywood vessel lumina were measured for each tree in the xylem tissue bordering the scars. Seven successive rings were examined, namely two control rings laid down prior to wounding and five rings in the wound xylem. We provide evidence that snow-avalanche-induced wounding resulted in atypically narrow earlywood vessels over at least two years. Our data demonstrate that wound-associated vessel anomalies represent tangible markers of mass-movement processes, and as such make a viable tool for reconstructing past events. Similar dendrogeomorphic studies based on tree-ring anatomy can be readily conducted with other mass-movement processes, as well as with other broad-leaved tree species. Ultimately, this new approach will foster increment coring over more invasive sampling techniques. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

39,"Decreasing frequency of forest fires in the southern boreal zone of Qu√©bec and its relation to global warming since the end of the ‚ÄòLittle Ice Age‚Äô | Although an increasing frequency of forest fires has been suggested as a consequence of global warming, there are no empirical data that have shown a climatically driven change in fire frequency since the warming that has followed the end of the ‚ÄòLittle Ice Age‚Äô. We present here evidence from fire and tree-ring chronologies that the post-‚ÄòLittle Ice Age‚Äô climate change has profoundly decreased the frequency of fires in the northwestern Qu√©bec boreal forest. A 300-year fire history (AD 1688-1988) from the Lake Duparquet area (48¬∞28' N, 79¬∞17' W) shows an important decrease, starting 100 years ago, in the number and the extent of fires. This decrease in fire frequency is also associated with a long- term increase in the mean ring width of northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) in the same area. Agreement between the standardized tree-ring chronology and fire years, together with a negative correlation with a drought index reconstructed for the AD 1913-1987 period, shows that the decrease in fire frequency may be related to a reduced frequency of drought periods since the end of the ‚ÄòLittle Ice Age‚Äô. The contradictory results between predicted and observed effects of warming on fire frequency call into question our present capability to generalize the effect of increasing CO2 levels on fire frequency. ¬© 1993, Sage Publications.

Using techniques such as crossdating and standardization, and the software programs COFECHA and ARSTAN, we developed C tetragona growth and reproduction chronologies for sites in the Canadian High Arctic. High-resolution chronologies may be used to reconstruct past climate and phase changes in large-scale modes of atmospheric circulation (e.g. Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation), to investigate the growth and reproductive responses of the plant to ambient and manipulated environmental variables, and to reconstruct the plant's past ecohydrology (delta O-18, delta D, delta C-13), gas exchange (delta C-13) and mineral nutrition (delta N-15). As C. tetragona is a circumpolar species, chronologies may be developed throughout the Arctic at sites where no trees exist, and thus provide new information on the past climate and environmental history of sites and regions previously unstudied. | ['henry', 'rayback'] | ","['henry', 'rayback']",3
42,"Dendrochronological potential of Salix alaxensis from the Kuujjua River area, western Canadian Arctic | This study presents the first annually-resolved chronology using Salix alaxensis (Anderss.) Cov from Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, an area well north of treeline. Forty-one samples were collected and examined for subsequent analysis. However, crossclating was difficult because of locally absent or missing rings and the narrowness of the rings, and ultimately thirteen stems were crossdated and used to evaluate their dendroclimatological potential. The chronology spans 74 years (1927-2000) and could potentially be extended further using subfossil wood. Precipitation data from December of the previous year to March of the current year were the most consistently and highly correlated with ring width. This suggests that the recharge of the soil moisture by early summer snowmelt is a key factor limiting growth of these shrubs. | ['gajewski', 'zalatan'] | ","['gajewski', 'zalatan']",3

45,"Dendrochronology Regression Models in Aufeis Formation Analysis | The paper examines the historical behaviour of such unique natural phenomena as the sheets of aufeis in the North East of Russia. They are studied using statistical methods for analyzing dendrochronological data. Dendrochronology is a scientific method based on comparing quantitative indicators of tree ring growth and the dynamics of aufeis formation in the past. Tree ring growth is an integral indicator which reflects the diversity of conditions in which trees grow and interact with the environment. Time series were obtained for the Ulakhan-Taryn and Buluus aufeis deposits located in the Middle Lena basin in Central Yakutia. Regression models were created using dendrochronological data, with the majority of the models being nonlinear. The sample mean, sample variance, and sample correlation coefficient were calculated for the time series. The regression model of the time series under study was represented as a combination of a non-random component, including the age trend and a climatic component, and a random component with zero expectation, which is the sum of factors unaccounted for, including autocorrelation. Depending on the locations where data were collected, both strong and moderate and weak dependencies of pine growth on aufeis influence were revealed. If there was strong or moderate aufeis influence, humidity had a minor impact on tree growth. If aufeis influence was weak, tree growth was moderately influenced by precipitation. There is a moderate dependence of tree growth on air temperature in all cases. | ['pomortsev', 'pomortseva', 'rozhin', 'trofimtsev'] | ","['pomortsev', 'pomortseva', 'rozhin', 'trofimtsev']",0

Analyses were made of the ring widths (approx. 5000 rings), and graphs are presented showing increment % from 1900 to 1975 in comparison with data from northern Sweden, in comparison with solar activity, and in relation to June/July temp. fluctuations from the long-term average. In general, the maxima and minima of increment correspond to the 11-year cycle of solar activity. Increment was directly related to solar activity of the current and of the preceding year, to the mean June/July temp. of the current and the preceding year, and to fluctuations of temp. in the current year from the long-term average; increment was inversely correlated with current-year precipitation. Maximum increment is observed with a mean June/July temp. of 12 deg C and a June/July precipitation of 100 mm; with a favourable combination of meteorological factors, even at quite low temperatures the increment is up to 10% or more above the long-term average. | ['feklistov'] | ",['feklistov'],2
47,"The dendroclimatic potential of Juniperus sibirica | Discs were taken from the best developed branches of 26 of the oldest bushes of Juniperus sibirica [Juniperus communis var. montana] growing in sparse larch forests in the Polar Urals. Discs were also taken from dead branches found near the living juniper bushes. Analysis of the discs allowed a 636-year ring-width chronology to be produced, revealing the mean May/June/July temperature of the current year to be the main climatic factor affecting radial increment. Comparison of the juniper chronology with the chronologies for Larix sibirica and Picea obovata revealed similarities and differences between the bushes and the trees. Constructing a combined chronology based on juniper and larch provided a much more reliable reconstruction of mean June/July temperatures than a chronology based on larch alone. | ['gorlanova', 'khantemirov', 'shiyatov'] | ","['gorlanova', 'khantemirov', 'shiyatov']",1

49,"Dendroclimatic reconstruction of maximum summer temperatures from upper treeline sites in Interior British Columbia, Canada | Two independent reconstructions of maximum May-August temperatures are developed from a new network of Engelmann spruce tree-ring chronologies at treeline sites across Interior British Columbia (IBC). The IBC reconstruction (ad 1600-1997) uses the longest three ring-width (RW) and two maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies from the region. The shorter (regional) reconstruction (REG, 1845-1997) is based on an independent, more broadly based network of chronologies (12 RW and 5 MXD) and verifies the regional signal in the parsimoniously sampled IBC reconstruction. Both models explain 53% of the regional temperature variance (1912-1995) and correlate strongly (r = 0.92) over their common period. The IBC reconstruction indicates two prolonged cooler intervals, c. 1620-1710 and 1775- 880, separated by warmer conditions that approached late twentieth-century normals between c. 1710 and 1730. The mean anomaly over the 1600-1900 period is estimated at 0.38degreesC below the 1961-1990 mean with the seventeenth century (1601-1700) being marginally colder than the nineteenth century (-0.53:-0.49degreesC). Both reconstructions model the rise in temperatures from the 1880s to 1940s and indicate that maximum summer temperatures since 1930 have been warmer than at any period since 1600. The IBC record from 1600-1900 is very similar to the mean summer-temperature record reconstructed in the adjacent Canadian Rockies, providing mutual verification for the regional nature of the signal in both reconstructions. This is the first maximum summer-temperature reconstruction from North America. Significant changes are also noted in the relationships between summer mean, maximum and minimum temperatures in this region in the last few decades with a greater absolute rate of increase in mean and minimum temperatures. These changing relationships suggest it is prudent to model tree-ring response to a variety of temperature parameters rather than using mean-temperature values. | ['luckman', 'wilson'] | ","['luckman', 'wilson']",0

51,"Dendroclimatic transfer functions revisited: Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period summer temperatures reconstructed using artificial neural networks and linear algorithms | Tree-rings tell of past climates. To do so, tree-ring chronologies comprising numerous climate-sensitive living-tree and subfossil time-series need to be ""transferred"" into palaeoclimate estimates using transfer functions. The purpose of this study is to compare different types of transfer functions, especially linear and nonlinear algorithms. Accordingly, multiple linear regression (MLR), linear scaling (LSC) and artificial neural networks (ANN, nonlinear algorithm) were compared. Transfer functions were built using a regional tree-ring chronology and instrumental temperature observations from Lapland (northern Finland and Sweden). In addition, conventional MLR was compared with a hybrid model whereby climate was reconstructed separately for short-and long-period timescales prior to combining the bands of timescales into a single hybrid model. The fidelity of the different reconstructions was validated against instrumental climate data. The reconstructions by MLR and ANN showed reliable reconstruction capabilities over the instrumental period (AD 1802-1998). LCS failed to reach reasonable verification statistics and did not qualify as a reliable reconstruction: this was due mainly to exaggeration of the low-frequency climatic variance. Over this instrumental period, the reconstructed low-frequency amplitudes of climate variability were rather similar by MLR and ANN. Notably greater differences between the models were found over the actual reconstruction period (AD 802-1801). A marked temperature decline, as reconstructed by MLR, from the Medieval Warm Period (AD 931-1180) to the Little Ice Age (AD 1601-1850), was evident in all the models. This decline was approx. 0.5 degrees C as reconstructed by MLR. Different ANN based palaeotemperatures showed simultaneous cooling of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C, depending on algorithm. The hybrid MLR did not seem to provide further benefit above conventional MLR in our sample. The robustness of the conventional MLR over the calibration, verification and reconstruction periods qualified it as a reasonable transfer function for our forest-limit (i.e., timberline) dataset. ANN appears a potential tool for other environments and/or proxies having more complex and noisier climatic relationships. | ['eronen', 'helama', 'holopainen', 'karimova', 'kruglun', 'makarenko', 'merilainen', 'timonen'] | ","['eronen', 'helama', 'holopainen', 'karimova', 'kruglun', 'makarenko', 'merilainen', 'timonen']",2

In addition, several chronologies between coastal Norway and the interior of Finland extend back several centuries. Tree-ring data from Fennoscandia have provided important information on regional climate variability during the mid to late Holocene and have played major roles in the reconstruction of hemispheric and global temperatures. Tree-ring data from the region have also been used to reconstruct large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, regional precipitation and drought. Such information is imperative when trying to reach better understanding of natural climate change and variability and its forcing mechanisms, and placing recent climate change within a long-term context. | ['bjorklund', 'drobyshev', 'grudd', 'gunnarson', 'jeong', 'linderholm', 'liu', 'seftigen'] | ","['bjorklund', 'drobyshev', 'grudd', 'gunnarson', 'jeong', 'linderholm', 'liu', 'seftigen']",3
54,"Dendroecological studies in lichen-spruce-woodland in central Labrador/Ungava, Canada | Lichen-spruce-woodland is the typical vegetation formation on the well-drained soils in the area around Schefferville, central Labrador-Ungava, where lichen (Cladina stellaris), black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca) characterise and dominate the mature successional stage. Dendroecological studies were carried out in seven selected mature stands between 90 and 170 yr of age. The main aim of these studies was to describe and explain the structural and physiognomic differences within these stands. A distinct individual growth pattern of spruce trees can be observed, which is largely independent of site characteristics, tree type and stand age in the mature stage. Both black and white spruce, which form the lichen-spruce-woodland, occur in mono-specific, as well as mixed stands, depending on the environmental conditions during post-fire regeneration. Their growth curves differ in shape as well as in the absolute growth rates. Reasons for these differences are listed and discussed. Independent of stand density, which varies in the seven selected stands from 300 to 2000/ha for trees >1m, the maximum above ground tree phytomass in the mature stage was approximately 20 000 kg/ha. In stands with a density of 300 trees/ha the entire phytomass is concentrated in the tall spruce trees which have a relatively even height distribution. In stands with a density of 2000 trees/ha the phytomass is distributed amongst only a few large and many small trees. In stands with a below average nutrient supply, the growth capacity and the total above ground biomass is lower (approximately 16 500 kg/ha) and is distributed according to stand density either amongst many or amongst only a few individuals. | ['treter'] | ",['treter'],3

Analyses of reconstructed temperatures in different regions of the Earth and of annual trees growth during the last several centuries in the North hemisphere has been made in the present paper. On the basis of the content of stable isotope 18O in ice cores variations of the Greenland temperature during the period since 900 till 1922 were also investigated. Main periodicities evaluated in the present work correspond to the quasi-200 years and centennial cycles, so called Suess and Glaissberg cycles that is in favor of the existence of central relationship between solar activity and climate changes. Additionally there was discovered that maxima in the annual trees growth usually occur on the rising and decay phases of the 11-year cycle. This fact might be explained if energetic of solar cosmic rays, which have the tendency to appear preferentially on the mentioned phased of solar activity, would affect local climate conditions.

56,"Detecting instabilities in tree-ring proxy calibration | Evidence has been found for reduced sensitivity of tree growth to temperature in a number of forests at high northern latitudes and alpine locations. Furthermore, at some of these sites, emergent subpopulations of trees show negative growth trends with rising temperature. These findings are typically referred to as the 'Divergence Problem' (DP). Given the high relevance of paleoclimatic reconstructions for policy-related studies, it is important for dendrochronologists to address this issue of potential model uncertainties associated with the DP. Here we address this issue by proposing a calibration technique, termed 'stochastic response function' (SRF), which allows the presence or absence of any instabilities in growth response of trees (or any other climate proxy) to their calibration target to be visualized and detected. Since this framework estimates confidence limits and subsequently provides statistical significance tests, the approach is also very well suited for proxy screening prior to the generation of a climate-reconstruction network. Two examples of tree growth/climate relationships are provided, one from the North American Arctic treeline and the other from the upper treeline in the European Alps. Instabilities were found to be present where stabilities were reported in the literature, and vice versa, stabilities were found where instabilities were reported. We advise to apply SRFs in future proxy-screening schemes, next to the use of correlations and RE/CE statistics. It will improve the strength of reconstruction hindcasts. | ['buntgen', 'darrigo', 'petersen', 'visser'] | ","['buntgen', 'darrigo', 'petersen', 'visser']",4
57,"Detection of climate signal in dendrochronological data analysis: a comparison of tree-ring standardization methods | Tree-ring standardization methods were compared. Traditional methods along with the recently introduced approaches of regional curve standardization (RCS) and power-transformation (PT) were included. The difficulty in removing non-climatic variation (noise) while simultaneously preserving the low-frequency variability in the tree-ring series was emphasized. The potential risk of obtaining inflated index values was analysed by comparing methods to extract tree-ring indices from the standardization curve. The material for the tree-ring series, previously used in several palaeoclimate predictions, came from living and dead wood of high-latitude Scots pine in northernmost Europe. This material provided a useful example of a long composite tree-ring chronology with the typical strengths and weaknesses of such data, particularly in the context of standardization. PT stabilized the heteroscedastic variation in the original tree-ring series more efficiently than any other standardization practice expected to preserve the low-frequency variability. RCS showed great potential in preserving variability in tree-ring series at centennial time scales; however, this method requires a homogeneous sample for reliable signal estimation. It is not recommended to derive indices by subtraction without first stabilizing the variance in the case of series of forest-limit tree-ring data. Index calculation by division did not seem to produce inflated chronology values for the past one and a half centuries of the chronology (where mean sample cambial age is high). On the other hand, potential bias of high RCS chronology values was observed during the period of anomalously low mean sample cambial age. An alternative technique for chronology construction was proposed based on series age decomposition, where indices in the young vigorously behaving part of each series are extracted from the curve by division and in the mature part by subtraction. Because of their specific nature, the dendrochronological data here should not be generalized to all tree-ring records. The examples presented should be used as guidelines for detecting potential sources of bias and as illustrations of the usefulness of tree-ring records as palaeoclimate indicators. | ['eronen', 'helama', 'lindholm', 'timonen'] | ","['eronen', 'helama', 'lindholm', 'timonen']",3
58,"Different climate responses of spruce and pine growth in Northern European Russia | We report new data on tree-ring growth in northern European Russia, a region with a hitherto relatively sparse tree-ring network. We explore its associations with climate variability. Areas, sampling locations and trees were selected for representativeness rather than climate sensitivity. Using tree rings from 651 conifers from six widely dispersed areas we show strong intercorrelation between trees within each major conifer species within and between areas. Regional composite tree-ring series for spruce and pine contain a major fraction of decadal and multidecadal variability. The most likely driver of this common variability is interannual to multidecadal climate variability. Gridded monthly instrumental climate data for the period 1902-2008, particularly mean temperature and total precipitation, were tested as predictors of each local species-specific tree-ring site chronology. The most consistent pattern emerged for spruce at all but the southernmost area. Cool and moist summers the year before growth were consistent drivers of spruce ring growth throughout the period, with no change in recent decades. Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index for prior summer was also a strong and consistent driver of spruce ring growth. For pine, there was a weaker but similarly stable association between larger rings and warm, moist conditions, in this case in the current summer. These associations were also identified at multidecadal time scales, particularly for spruce. On the other hand, the specific role of moisture variability in determining interannual to multidecadal variability in tree growth in this high latitude region raises questions about the relative vulnerability of spruce and pine there under global warming. | ['berner', 'bunn', 'hughes', 'losleben', 'novenko', 'olchev'] | ","['berner', 'bunn', 'hughes', 'losleben', 'novenko', 'olchev']",2
59,"Direct transformation of tree-ring measurements into palaeoclimate reconstructions in three-dimensional space | Here we propose a new method for dendroclimatic reconstructions. This DIrect REConstruction Technique (DIRECT) performs modelling of the age-dependent association between climate and growth in three-dimensional space and directly transforms the raw tree-ring values (on the scale of original growth units) into climate variability while considering the effect of age in this relationship. DIRECT was applied to maximum latewood density (MXD) data from Finnish/Swedish Lapland. The new DIRECT reconstruction was compared with a reconstruction produced using regional curve standardization (RCS), a method that is often used to preserve the low-frequency variability in tree-ring proxy data. Comparison of the DIRECT and RCS methods showed that both produced summer temperature reconstructions with approximately equal amounts of low-frequency palaeoclimate information. The DIRECT method avoids traditional detrending techniques by considering the cambial age of each tree when building the statistical climate-proxy model and identifying non-linear relationships between climate and tree growth. DIRECT provides objective consideration and removal of differential growth rates and age-related noise without losing the low-frequency portion of palaeoclimate variability. It is anticipated that DIRECT will prove to be a useful tool in regions where strong climate control enables the use of tree rings for palaeoclimate reconstructions. | ['helama', 'matskovsky'] | ","['helama', 'matskovsky']",0
60,"Can We Distinguish between Tree-Ring Eccentricity Developed as a Result of Landsliding and Prevailing Winds? Consequences for Dendrochronological Dating | The aim of our study was to compare patterns of tree-ring eccentricity developed in Norway spruce trees as a result of landsliding with the one caused by the prevailing wind (in 2 study sites), and with the normal growth of trees (in 2 reference sites). We sampled 20 trees per study site and 10 per reference site. Two cores were taken from each tree (120 cores in total) from the upslope and downslope, windward and leeward sides of stems. Ring widths measured on opposite sides of stems were compared using the method of percent eccentricity index. Graphs of the index obtained for individual trees were analysed. Statistical indicators were calculated for a percent eccentricity index. Disturbance events were dated and the response index was calculated. The results show that the patterns of eccentricity developed as a result of the prevailing winds and due to landsliding differ from one another and from the reference sites. The results suggest that the impact of the prevailing wind on tree growth is more severe than the impact of landsliding. The difference may result from the slow-moving character of the landslide under study. The results, however, indicate that wind impact should be taken into account in dendrogeomorphic research and that the impact of mass movements should be considered in dendroecological studies on wind. | ['krapiec', 'malik', 'wistuba'] | ","['krapiec', 'malik', 'wistuba']",4

Four new white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) ring-width chronologies from four sites along a 30 kilometer north-south transect in the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve on the Alaskan Peninsula span a common interval from AD 1769 to 2003.

The two other sites each contain two subpopulations showing varying growth responses. One subpopulation diverges from historical temperature data after 1950 and one shows increased growth consistent with warming or exceeds expected growth increases. The growth decline may be due to temperature-induced drought stress that acts on some trees.

62,"Drought explains variation in the radial growth of white spruce in western Canada | Many studies have already addressed the existence of unstable and nonlinear relationships between radial growth of white spruce (Picea glauca) and climate variables in boreal forests along the high latitudes (>60 degrees N). However, along the mid-latitudes, the climate-growth relationship is still poorly understood. In this study, we used a network of ring-width chronologies from 40 white spruce sites along a wide latitudinal gradients from 52 degrees N to 58 degrees N in Alberta, Canada and attempted to understand the complicated response of tree growth to climatic variables and to identify the main limiting factor for the radial growth of white spruce. We combined the empirical linear statistics with the process-based Vaganov-Shashkin Lite (VS-Lite) model requiring only latitude, monthly mean temperature, and monthly total precipitation information together to better clarify growth-climate relationship. The linear statistical methods indicated that the previous summer temperature imposed a strong negative impact on the radial growth of white spruce while the precipitation and climate moisture index in prior and current summer both had significant positive effects on the radial growth. Similarly, the VS-Lite model showed that the radial growth of white spruce was limited by soil moisture. This suggests that temperature-induced drought is the main limiting factor for the radial growth of white spruce. Furthermore, climate-growth relationship varied along different elevations, latitudes, and growing degree days (GDD >5 degrees C). The radial growth of white spruce in northern stands was often more strongly limited by temperature-induced drought due to the higher temperature and lower precipitation. As the global climate change is in progress, we suggest that more large-scale and continuous investigations are needed to address the spatial variation in growth-climate relationship due to the temperature-induced drought. | ['alam', 'chen', 'comeau', 'dawson', 'huang', 'stadt', 'zhai'] | ","['alam', 'chen', 'comeau', 'dawson', 'huang', 'stadt', 'zhai']",2

Old northern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) trees were sampled at their northwestern limit of distribution in central Canada. The objectives of the study were (i) to investigate the association between tree-ring delta C-13 values and radial growth in addition to the response of these variables to climate, (ii) to assess site differences between two sites varying in moisture regime, and (iii) to compare tree-ring delta C-13 of T. occidentalis with that of other boreal tree species growing at the northern limit of their distribution in central Canada. Over 2500 tree rings comprised of 15 T. occidentalis trees were analyzed for delta C-13. Annually resolved delta C-13 (1650-2006) and ring-width (1542-2006) chronologies were developed. During the year of ring formation, ring width was associated with spring and early-summer conditions, whereas delta C-13 was more indicative of overall summer conditions. However, compared with delta C-13 values, ring width was more often associated with climate conditions in the year prior to ring formation. Conditions conducive to moisture stress were important for both parameters. Although ring width and delta C-13 corresponded to the drought intervals of the 1790s, 1840s, 1890s, 1930s, and 1960-1970, ring width may be more responsive to prolonged drought than delta C-13. Tree-ring delta C-13 could, however, provide important information regarding physiological adaptations to drought. | ['au', 'tardif'] | ","['au', 'tardif']",2

66,"Early summer temperatures since 1670 A.D. for central Kamchatka reconstructed based on a Siberian larch tree-ring width chronology | A tree-ring width chronology of larch (Larix kurilensis Mayr) has been developed from along the Bystraya River near Esso in the interior valley of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. The chronology, which covers from 1670 to 1992, explains 38% of the variance in May-June temperatures for the Esso meteorological station. This ring-width series is used to develop the first dendroclimatic reconstruction for Kamchatka. We caution that the Esso station record, the closest to the tree-ring site, is only 42 years in length, making model verification difficult. Periods of above-average temperatures are inferred for ca. 1750, 1800, and over the last few decades; colder than average conditions are inferred for 1710-1720, 1760-1770s, and 1860-1880s. The ring-width chronology cross-dates with other larch tree-ring data for Kamchatka and, during certain intervals, with a larch ring-width record from eastern Siberia. Comparison of the two records suggests that the insertion of a missing ring for the year 1816 in the eastern Siberian series is not justified. A birch (Betula ermanii Cham.) chronology from a coastal site near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy correlates with July-August temperatures. Both the larch and more widespread birch species show promise for further dendroclimatic studies in Kamchatka. | ['darrigo', 'gostev', 'jacoby', 'khomentovsky', 'wile'] | ","['darrigo', 'gostev', 'jacoby', 'khomentovsky', 'wile']",1
67,"Early holocene tree growth at a high elevation site in the northernmost Scandes of Sweden (Lapland): A palaeobiogeographical case study based on megafossil evidence | The paper focuses on early Holocene tree growth and alpine tree-limits in the northernmost Swedish Scandes (Lapland). Megafossil wood remnants in peats and lakes were searched for over a large area at elevations high above the modem tree-limits. Wood of Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa and Alnus incana was discovered near the shore of a small lake (999 m a.s.l.) c. 500 m higher than today's tree-limit of Pinus sylvestris in this region. Radiocarbon dating yielded values of unprecedented age, c. 8500-8100 C-14 years sp for all three species and in addition 5400-4500 C-14 years sp for Betula and Alnus. The highest position of the Pinus tree-limit occurred during the early Holocene, which compares well with the situation reconstructed by megafossils in the southern Scandes. It now appears that the long-term tree-limit and climate histories are broadly the same in entire mid- and northern Fennoscandia. Corrected for glacio-isostatic land uplift, the tree-limit record suggests that the summers were c. 2.4 degrees C warmer than today at 8500 C-14 years sp. A dry continental climate with substantial seasonal contrasts is likely to have prevailed during this period, which restricted the occurrence of glaciers and glacier activity. Most circumstances point to the overriding importance of the Milankovitch orbital theory for pacing or forcing the long-term postglacial climate change. The results are inconsistent with most inferences based on pollen, certain macrofossil records and general circulation simulations. These proxy environmental histories have frequently advocated a mid-Holocene thermal optimum and an oceanic and humid climate in northern and western Fennoscandia during the early Holocene. The uncovered discrepancy between the outcome of the objective and factual megafossil method and more subjective/inferential microfossil methods should be important for Quaternary plant ecology in general, stressing the usefulness of megafossil studies. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],3
68,"Ecological tree line history and palaeoclimate - review of megafossil evidence from the Swedish Scandes | The postglacial tree line and climate history in the Swedish Scandes have been inferred from megafossil tree remains. Investigated species are mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and grey alder (Alnus incana). Betula and Pinus first appeared on early deglaciated nunataks during the Lateglacial. Their tree lines peaked between 9600 and 9000 cal. a BP, almost 600m higher than present-day elevations. This implies (adjusted for land uplift) that early Holocene summer temperatures may have been 2.3 degrees C above modern ones. Elevational tree line retreat characterized the Holocene tree line evolution. For short periods, excursions from this trend have occurred. Between c. 12000 and 10000 cal. a BP, a pine-dominated subalpine belt prevailed. A first major episode of descent occurred c. 8200 cal. a BP, possibly forced by cooling and an associated shift to a deeper and more persistent snow pack. Thereafter, the subalpine birch forest belt gradually evolved at the expense of the prior pine-dominated tree line ecotone. A second episode of pine descent took place c. 4800 cal. a BP. Historical tree line positions are viewed in relation to early 21st century equivalents, and indicate that tree line elevations attained during the past century and in association with modern climate warming are highly unusual, but not unique, phenomena from the perspective of the past 4800 years. Prior to that, the pine tree line (and summer temperatures) was consistently higher than present, as it was also during the Roman and Medieval periods, c. 1900 and 1000 cal. a BP, respectively. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],2

70,"Effects of Climate, Site Conditions, and Seed Quality on Recent Treeline Dynamics in NW Russia: Permafrost and Lack of Reproductive Success Hamper Treeline Advance? | Treeline advance alters albedo and carbon storage and is an important feedback mechanism to the global climate system. Establishment of trees north of the treeline requires favorable climate, suitable microsites, and viable seeds. Here we studied the influence of climate and microsite conditions on tree and seedling growth at four transects from forest through woodland to tundra in NW Russia, and tested the viability of seeds from the region. General growth patterns and establishment periods of the treeline species Picea obovata are similar across the study sites suggesting a regional driver (for example, climate). Individuals established as early as the 1640s, but mainly between 1850 and 1880, and during a major and continental scale establishment wave in the 1950s and 1960s. No establishment occurred after 1982. Older trees mainly showed significant and stable positive relationships to growing year summer temperatures and significant stable negative correlations to previous year summer temperatures in nearly all plots. Trees from the last establishment wave showed more mixed responses, but current year summer temperature positively affected growth. Active layer depth was similar in all plots with trees but decreased sharply in treeless tundra. A major role for the lack of recent establishment seems to be very low seed viability, possibly combined with early strong fall frosts, which might have severely limited successful recruitment in the last decades of the twentieth century. For a successful establishment of P. obovata in tundra areas of NW Russia, permafrost degradation and (generally) warmer winters might be a prerequisite. | ['crittenden', 'holzkaemper', 'kenter', 'sander', 'wilmking', 'zhang'] | ","['crittenden', 'holzkaemper', 'kenter', 'sander', 'wilmking', 'zhang']",3
71,"Effect of different sources of climate databases on the assessment of growth response in dendroclimatic analyses | The paper deals with the comparison of the time series from different climate databases. We compared the measured data with the modelled data of monthly and seasonal temperature means and precipitation totals. Reliable and as long as possible time series of such data represent the basic starting point of dendroclimatic analyses. We evaluated the differences in the growth response of spruce derived using different databases of the stated climatic characteristics. The stem cores used to derive the cross-correlation function were taken from Haras locality situated in the boreal zone of the Swedish part of Lapland. We compared the measured records from the nearest meteorological stations situated 18 km and 40 km away from the locality with the interpolated values from CRU TS 3.21 climate database and with the reconstructed 502-year-long database. The spatial resolution of the modelled databases was 0.5 x 0.5 degrees of latitude and longitude. We found a systematic error of different magnitudes in the modelled values, and we also quantified a random error and the overall accuracy of the data. The temperature model underestimated the data in comparison with the measured values, while the precipitation model overestimated the data. We also found that the radial increments of spruce correlated more strongly with the temperature than with the precipitation. Hence, in the conditions of the boreal zone, temperature is a more important factor affecting tree-ring formation. We found significantly higher correlations between the radial increment and the modelled precipitation data than with the data measured at the precipitation station situated 18 km from the locality of interest. | ['sitko', 'skvarenina', 'srncova', 'vido'] | ","['sitko', 'skvarenina', 'srncova', 'vido']",0
72,"The effect of past changes in inter-annual temperature variability on tree distribution limits | AimThe northern limits of temperate broadleaved species in Fennoscanndia are controlled by their requirements for summer warmth for successful regeneration and growth as well as by the detrimental effects of winter cold on plant tissue. However, occurrences of meteorological conditions with detrimental effects on individual species are rare events rather than a reflection of average conditions. We explore the effect of changes in inter-annual temperature variability on the abundances of the tree species Tilia cordata, Quercus robur and Ulmus glabra near their distribution limits using a process-based model of ecosystem dynamics.LocationA site in central Sweden and a site in southern Finland were used as examples for the ecotone between boreal and temperate forests in Fennoscandia. The Finnish site was selected because of the availability of varve-thickness data.MethodsThe dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS was run with four scenarios of inter-annual temperature forcing for the last 10,000 years. In one scenario the variability in the thickness of summer and winter varves from the annually laminated lake in Finland was used as a proxy for past inter-annual temperature variability. Two scenarios were devised to explore systematically the effect of stepwise changes in the variance and shape parameter of a probability distribution. All variability scenarios were run both with and without the long-term trend in Holocene temperature change predicted by an atmospheric general circulation model.ResultsDirectional changes in inter-annual temperature variability have significant effects on simulated tree distribution limits through time. Variations in inter-annual temperature variability alone are shown to alter vegetation composition by magnitudes similar to the magnitude of changes driven by variation in mean temperatures.Main conclusionsThe varve data indicate that inter-annual climate variability has changed in the past. The model results show that past changes in species abundance can be explained by changes in the inter-annual variability of climate parameters as well as by mean climate. Because inter-annual climatic variability is predicted to change in the future, this component of climate change should be taken into account both when making projections of future plant distributions and when interpreting vegetation history. | ['bradshaw', 'giesecke', 'miller', 'ojala', 'seppa', 'sykes'] | ","['bradshaw', 'giesecke', 'miller', 'ojala', 'seppa', 'sykes']",3
73,"The effect of temperature on the radial growth of Scots pine in northernmost Fennoscandia | The effect of temperature on the low-frequency variation of Scots pine growth was analyzed using tree-ring data from the northern forest limit, northern Finland. Special effort was, therefore, made to avoid loss of low-frequency variation in standardizing ring-width series. Three models representing different approaches were used for describing the climate-growth relationship. Two of them, a dynamic model based on daily maximum temperatures and a traditional linear model, emphasize mainly the effect of midsummer temperatures. In addition, a dynamic model was constructed for describing the effects of spring and autumn temperatures, based on describing the seasonal variation of the CO2 uptake capacity of Scots pine. The results show that the very large low-frequency variation in ring-widths, typical for regions with harsh climate, is to a considerable extent due to climate. The results are in accordance with previous findings suggesting that the climatic signal in northern tree rings is dominated by the effect of July temperatures. However, the results also suggest that temperature throughout the photosynthetically active period can be useful in explaining growth variation of Scots pine. | ['hari', 'nojd'] | ","['hari', 'nojd']",0

75,"Evaluating the integrity of C and O isotopes in sub-fossil wood from boreal lakes | Extending climatic series back to the first millennium using isotopic tree-ring chronologies in northern regions represents a challenge because trees seldom reach the adequate age. Fossil trees deposited in boreal lakes could serve such an endeavor provided that dating the tree-ring series is possible and that the isotopic ratios of sub-fossil wood are preserved. From two boreal lakes in north-eastern Canada, we collected segments of Picea mariana (black spruce) stems with different degrees of wood textural preservation and covering the last millennium. Our main objectives are to assess the selection criteria for wood textures suitable for isotopic reconstruction, and verify the reliability of sub-fossil cellulose carbon and oxygen isotopic series for climatic reconstruction in boreal regions. The isotopic differences between cellulose and lignin obtained for 48 ring pairs of a living tree (Delta delta C-13(c-l) = 3.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand; Delta delta O-18(c-l) = 13 +/- 1) and 46 contemporaneous pairs from a subfossil stem (3.5 +/- 0.3 and 12.9 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand in the same order), are systematic and matching. For the selection of all sub-fossil samples, we have visually identified three main classes of wood textures for which the degree of alteration is confirmed by secondary electron microscopy: well preserved, slightly altered and highly altered. Slightly altered stem segments have cellulose proportion showing a relative decrease reaching 35%, but Delta delta C-13(c-l) and Delta delta O-18(c-l) values within the range of living trees. Non-altered sub-fossil stems covering the 14th and 11th centuries show systematic and coherent Delta delta C-13(c-l) (3.5 +/- 0.2; 3.8 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand) and Delta delta O-18(c-l) results (13.9 +/- 0.7; 13.5 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand). Highly altered wood shows a decrease in both cellulose proportion and delta O-18(cellulose) values, but apparently preserved delta 13C ratios. This research shows that it is possible to visually identify the degree of wood preservation and preselect sub-fossil segments holding reliable isotope-ratios, and to use subfossil stems collected from boreal lake floors to reconstruct climate over the last millennia.

77,"New evidence of solar variation in temperature proxies from Northern Fennoscandia | A new summer temperature proxy was built for northern Fennoscandia in AD 1000-2004 using parameters of tree growth from a large region, extending from the Swedish Scandes to the Kola Peninsula. It was found that century-scale (55-140 year) cyclicity is present in this series during the entire time interval. This periodicity is highly significant and has a hi-modal structure, i.e. it consists of two oscillation modes, 55-100 year and 100-140 year variations. A comparison of the century-long variation in the northern Fennoscandian temperature proxy with the corresponding variations in Wolf numbers and concentration of cosmogenic Be in glacial ice shows that a probable cause of this periodicity is the modulation of regional climate by the secular solar cycle of Gleissberg. This is in line with the results obtained previously for a more limited part of the region (Finnish Lapland: 68-70 degrees N, 20-30 degrees E). Thus the reality of a link between long-term changes in solar activity and climate in Fennoscandia has been confirmed. Possible mechanisms of solar influence on the lower troposphere are discussed.

78,"Evidences of wider latewood in Pinus sylvestris from a forest-steppe of Southern Siberia | Climate affects wood formation with consequences for the functioning and survival of trees. Since tree-rings tissues (i.e., earlywood and latewood) are formed at different time in the season, the impact of climate change might differently affect their functions.In this study, we combine quantitative tracheid anatomy with the Vaganov-Shashkin growth model (VS-model) to investigate how summer drought affected the annual ring structure of Pinus sylvestris L. from a foreststeppe zone in Southern Siberia. In particular, we used climate-growth relationships over a 50-year period to identify the timing of climatic signal of early-, transition-, and late-wood tracheid's diameters (DEW, D-TW and D-LW). Corresponding daily growth rates (Gr) obtained by the VS-model were applied to calculate the changes in the width of the relative tree-ring sectors considering different levels of aridity.Results indicate that tracheid size is sensitive to drought with temporal shifts among the climatic signal of D-EW (in May), D-TW (June) and D-LW ( July). A comparison of modeled daily-growth rate cumulated over the climatic window of each ring sector and grouped by years with different level of aridity, indicated that a release of summer drought mostly affected the widths of the transition (+ 28.1%) and (+ 48.6%) latewood sectors, thus matching observations performed on the same cores.These results suggest that current changes in climate seasonality, as occurring in the selected area, are positively impacting both the hydraulic efficiency (by increasing the diameter of the earlywood cells) and the latewood width of the wood produced in the area. | ['arzac', 'babushkina', 'fonti', 'slobodchikova', 'sviderskaya', 'vaganov'] | ","['arzac', 'babushkina', 'fonti', 'slobodchikova', 'sviderskaya', 'vaganov']",0
79,"Expressing Tree-Ring Chronology as Age-Standardized Growth Measurements | Tree-ring data of individual trees show lifelong biological trends as a function of cambial age. The compilation of a tree-ring chronology entails standardization (detrending) of the series. Tree-ring standardization commonly derives detrended series of dimensionless tree-ring data that are devoid of the original growth measurements (millimeter, density). A new method is proposed in this study. This method derives modeled tree-ring growth variations to calculate age-standardized tree-ring chronology that allow comparisons between the absolute growth measurements of different sites, regions, or species and between the absolute growth measurements and environmental factors such as climate variables. The modeled tree-ring growth is simply obtained through ranked transformation of the tree-ring values within the user-defined reference age class (RAC) and all remaining cambial age classes. The chronology is thus presented on the scale of growth measurements of the specific tree's age, instead of dimensionless tree-ring indices. This presentation allows the accurate estimation of both the short- and long-term growth variations. The RAC method used at the timberline sites in northern Finland revealed a nonlinear age-dependent association between mid-summer (July) temperature and Scots pine growth of 0.072 mm/degrees C and 0.014 mm/degrees C for cambial age ranges of 1 to 5 to 226 to 330 years. | ['helama'] | ",['helama'],2
80,"An extended Arctic proxy temperature database for the past 2,000 years | Robust climate reconstructions of the most recent centuries and millennia are invaluable for placing modern warming in the context of natural variability. Here we present an extended and revised database (version 1.1) of proxy temperature records recently used to reconstruct Arctic temperatures for the past 2,000 years. The datasets are presented in a machine-readable format, and have been extended with the geochronologic data and consistently generated time-uncertain ensembles, which will be useful in future analyses of the influence of geochronologic uncertainty. A standardized description of the seasonality of the temperature response for each record, as reported by the original authors, is also included to motivate a more nuanced approach to integrating records with variable seasonal sensitivities. Despite the predominance of seasonal, rather than annual, temperature responders in the database, comparisons with the instrumental record of temperature suggest that, as a whole, the datasets best record annual temperature variability across the Arctic, especially in northeast Canada and Greenland, where the density of records is highest. | ['kaufman', 'mckay'] | ","['kaufman', 'mckay']",0
81,"Extracting long-period climate fluctuations from tree-ring chronologies over timescales of centuries to millennia | For a long time, tree-rings have been thought of as containing almost no variation at timescales of centuries and millennia, i.e. at low frequencies. Here, we show that this might be an issue of data analysis rather than an actual lack of variability. A data set of subfossil and living Scots pines from northern Fennoscandia was examined by means of their ring-width time series. The premise was that the growth trends of individual time series could be quantitatively determined and decomposed into their different elements. It was shown that not all the components of growth trends were invariant over long periods of time, and that consequently the use of a single-curve standardization (i.e. Regional Curve Standardization, RCS) may result in temporally inflated and deflated indices of ring-widths. Observed non-climatic bias in tree-ring indices was probably due to gradually changing conditions in the pine population of the forest-limit ecotone. Changes in population density seem to have hampered the previous attempts at palaeoclimate reconstruction by masking the actual low-frequency climate variability. A new approach, expected to yield unbiased tree-ring indices, was proposed. The new chronology constructed by this approach showed consistency with multi-centennial variations that are based on independent palaeoclimate evidence.

82,"Fennoscandia revisited: a spatially improved tree-ring reconstruction of summer temperatures for the last 900 years | Despite the spatially homogenous summer temperature pattern in Fennoscandia, there are large spreads among the many existing reconstructions, resulting in an uncertainty in the timing and amplitude of past changes. Also, there has been a general bias towards northernmost Fennoscandia. In an attempt to provide a more spatially coherent view of summer (June-August, JJA) temperature variability within the last millennium, we utilized seven density and three blue intensity Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) chronologies collected from the altitudinal (Scandinavian Mountains) and latitudinal (northernmost part) treeline. To attain a JJA temperature signal as strong as possible, as well as preserving multicentury-scale variability, we used a new tree-ring parameter, where the earlywood information is removed from the maximum density and blue intensity, and a modified signal-free standardization method. Two skilful reconstructions for the period 11002006 CE were made, one regional reconstruction based on an average of the chronologies, and one field (gridded) reconstruction. The new reconstructions were shown to have much improved spatial representations compared to those based on data from only northern sites, thus making it more valid for the whole region. An examination of some of the forcings of JJA mean temperatures in the region shows an association with sea-surface temperature over the eastern North Atlantic, but also the subpolar and subtropical gyres. Moreover, using Superposed Epoch Analysis, a significant cooling in the year following a volcanic eruption was noted, and for the largest explosive eruptions, the effect could remain for up to 4 years. This new improved reconstruction provides a mean to reinforce our understanding of forcings on summer temperatures in the North European sector. | ['bjorklund', 'fuentes', 'gunnarson', 'linderholm', 'seftigen'] | ","['bjorklund', 'fuentes', 'gunnarson', 'linderholm', 'seftigen']",2

85,"Forest Responses to Co2 Enrichment and Climate Warming | Two of the major uncertainties in forecasting future terrestrial sources and SinkS Of CO2 are the CO2-enhanced growth response of forests and soil warming effects on net CO2 efflux from forests. Carbon dioxide enrichment of tree seedlings over time periods less than 1 yr has generally resulted in enhanced rates of photosynthesis, decreased respiration, and increased growth, with minor increases in leaf area and small changes in C allocation. Exposure of woody species to elevated CO2 over several years has shown that high rates of photosynthesis may be sustained, but net C accumulation may not necessarily increase if CO2 release from soil respiration increases. The impact of the 25% rise in atmospheric CO2 with industrialization has been examined in tree ring chronologies from a range of species and locations. In contrast to the seedling tree results, there is no convincing evidence for CO2-enhanced stem growth of mature trees during the last several decades. However, if mature trees show a preferential root growth response to CO2 enrichment, the gain in root mass for an oak-hickory forest in eastern Tennessee is estimated to be only 9% over the last 40 years. Root data bases are inadequate for detecting such an effect. A very small shift in ecosystem nutrients from soil to vegetation could support CO2-enhanced growth. Climate warming and the accompanying increase in mean soil temperature could have a greater effect than CO2 enrichment on terrestrial sources and sinks Of CO2. Soil respiration and N mineralization have been shown to increase with soil temperature. If plant growth increases with increased N availability, and more C is fixed in growth than is released by soil respiration, then a negative feedback on climate warming will occur. If warming results in a net increase in CO2 efflux from forests, then a positive feedback will follow. A 2 to 4-degrees-C increase in soil temperature could increase CO2 efflux from soil by 15 to 32% in eastern deciduous forests. Quantifying C budget responses of forests to future global change scenarios will be speculative until mature tree responses to CO2 enrichment and the effects of temperature on terrestrial sources and sinks of CO2 can be determined. | ['hanson', 'luxmoore', 'wullschleger'] | ","['hanson', 'luxmoore', 'wullschleger']",4

They are also the focus of a constantly evolving array of analytical techniques and multidisciplinary approaches to research questions. This literature review discusses case studies at the cutting-edge of interdisciplinary tree-ring research, notes recent breakthroughs and limitations, and identifies key frontiers for the future of tree-ring research. | ['herrick', 'keck', 'meko', 'pearl', 'pearson', 'siekacz', 'tintor'] | ","['herrick', 'keck', 'meko', 'pearl', 'pearson', 'siekacz', 'tintor']",0
87,"Frost-ring chronologies as dendroclimatic proxies of boreal environments | Frost rings are formed in tree stems when growing-season frosts affect immature wood cells, producing collapsed cells within annual tree rings. Open boreal forests are most susceptible to record growing-season frost because they lack the greenhouse effect commonly observed in closed forests. Here we present a novel method to construct regional frost-ring chronologies in lichen-black spruce woodlands of the boreal forest zone. Because the ability of trees to form frost rings depends on several factors (including bark thickness and ring width), we used two models to produce a Frost Composite Index based on a frost susceptibility window of cambial age <30 years. The frost-ring chronology showed alternating periods of high and low frost activity that were highly consistent within and among sites. Reconstruction of growing-season frost activity may be used as dendroclimatic proxies of climate variability and may give insights into future risks of frost damage in a warming climate. | ['delwaide', 'payette', 'simard'] | ","['delwaide', 'payette', 'simard']",2
88,"Frost rings and white earlywood rings in Picea mariana trees from the boreal plains, central canada | Dendroecological analysis of tree-ring anomalies can facilitate better environmental reconstructions provided that conditions leading to their formation are well understood. White earlywood rings (WER) constitute an anomaly not previously described and, like frost rings (FR), occur often in boreal coniferous species in central Canada. The objectives of this study were i) to examine the distribution of FR and WER in black spruce trees, ii) to measure and compare tracheid dimensions in WER and control rings and iii) to investigate potential causes of WER formation. Sampling was conducted in two regions of western Manitoba. At each of four sampling sites, ten black spruce trees were selected for stem analysis. Results indicated that FR were mainly formed in the smaller diameter, thin barked portion of the stem up to a height of 16m, whereas WER were almost uniformly distributed along the stem. Tracheids were measured for WER occurring in 1916, 1943 and 1970 and WER were found to have earlywood tracheids with significantly thinner cell walls compared to control rings. It is speculated that the formation of WER may be related to reduced hormone and carbohydrate availability in the early growing season. The potential linkage between WER and frost events, or other agents of defoliation, prior to ring formation merits further investigation. ¬© International Association of Wood Anatomists, 2013. | ['conciatori', 'tardif', 'waito'] | ","['conciatori', 'tardif', 'waito']",2
89,"Fusing pollen-stratigraphic and dendroclimatic proxy data to reconstruct summer temperature variability during the past 7.5 ka in subarctic Fennoscandia | A new palaeoclimatic reconstruction of mid-summer (July) temperatures for the last 7.5 ka in northern Fennoscandia is presented. It is based on two botanical proxies: spectra of fossil pollen and tree rings of Scots pine logs recovered from lacustrine sediments in the Arctic tree-line region. A newly developed method of proxy fusion is used to integrate the proxy-specific reconstructions of past summer temperature variability based on the pollen-stratigraphic and dendroclimatic data. The rationale behind the method is that the two proxies are likely to be connected to climate variability in a timescale-dependent fashion and, accordingly, the new reconstruction makes use of the low- and high-frequencies from pollen-stratigraphic and tree-ring data, respectively. The most prominent features of the new reconstruction are: (1) the long-term decline of temperatures by 2.0 degrees C over the past 7.5 ka, (2) the mid-Holocene warmth culminating between 5 and 4 ka as a deviation from the cooling trend, (3) the Little Ice Age cool phase between 0.7 and 0.1 ka, and (4) the subsequent warming during the past century. These periods are superimposed on year-to-year variations in climate as dated to calendar-year accuracy by dendrochronology. Within the modern period, the years 1934 and 1937 are among the warmest, and the years 1903 and 1910 are among the coldest summers in the context of the past 7.5 ka. On average, the reconstructed Holocene climate was approximately 0.85 degrees C warmer than the twentieth century. | ['birks', 'bjune', 'helama', 'seppa'] | ","['birks', 'bjune', 'helama', 'seppa']",0
90,"The GenTree Dendroecological Collection, tree-ring and wood density data from seven tree species across Europe | The dataset presented here was collected by the GenTree project (EU-Horizon 2020), which aims to improve the use of forest genetic resources across Europe by better understanding how trees adapt to their local environment. This dataset of individual tree-core characteristics including ring-width series and whole-core wood density was collected for seven ecologically and economically important European tree species: silver birch (Betula pendula), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Norway spruce (Picea abies), European black poplar (Populus nigra), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea). Tree-ring width measurements were obtained from 3600 trees in 142 populations and whole-core wood density was measured for 3098 trees in 125 populations. This dataset covers most of the geographical and climatic range occupied by the selected species. The potential use of it will be highly valuable for assessing ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental conditions as well as for model development and parameterization, to predict adaptability under climate change scenarios. | ['alia', 'aravanopoulos', 'avanzi', 'bagnoli', 'barbas', 'bastias', 'bastien', 'benavides', 'bernier', 'bodineau', 'carvalho', 'cavers', 'charpentier', 'climent', 'correard', 'courdier', 'danusevicius', 'dauphin', 'fady', 'farsakoglou', 'fonti', 'garcia', 'del', 'barrio', 'gilg', 'gonzalez', 'martinez', 'gray', 'grefen', 'gugerli', 'hartleitner', 'heer', 'hurel', 'jouineau', 'kaerkkaeinen', 'knutzen', 'kujala', 'labriola', 'lascoux', 'lefebvre', 'lejeune', 'liesebach', 'malliarou', 'mariotte', 'martinez', 'sancho', 'matesanz', 'mette', 'tollefsrud', 'morganti', 'myking', 'notivol', 'opgenoorth', 'pakull', 'piotti', 'pringarbe', 'pyhaejaervi', 'raffin', 'ramirez', 'valiente', 'ramskogler', 'rellstab', 'robledo', 'arnuncio', 'savolainen', 'schueler', 'semerikov', 'slamova', 'spanu', 'thevenet', 'turion', 'valladares', 'veisse', 'vendramin', 'villar', 'westin', 'von', 'arx'] | ","['alia', 'aravanopoulos', 'avanzi', 'bagnoli', 'barbas', 'bastias', 'bastien', 'benavides', 'bernier', 'bodineau', 'carvalho', 'cavers', 'charpentier', 'climent', 'correard', 'courdier', 'danusevicius', 'dauphin', 'fady', 'farsakoglou', 'fonti', 'garcia', 'del', 'barrio', 'gilg', 'gonzalez', 'martinez', 'gray', 'grefen', 'gugerli', 'hartleitner', 'heer', 'hurel', 'jouineau', 'kaerkkaeinen', 'knutzen', 'kujala', 'labriola', 'lascoux', 'lefebvre', 'lejeune', 'liesebach', 'malliarou', 'mariotte', 'martinez', 'sancho', 'matesanz', 'mette', 'tollefsrud', 'morganti', 'myking', 'notivol', 'opgenoorth', 'pakull', 'piotti', 'pringarbe', 'pyhaejaervi', 'raffin', 'ramirez', 'valiente', 'ramskogler', 'rellstab', 'robledo', 'arnuncio', 'savolainen', 'schueler', 'semerikov', 'slamova', 'spanu', 'thevenet', 'turion', 'valladares', 'veisse', 'vendramin', 'villar', 'westin', 'von', 'arx']",2
91,"Geometrid moth outbreaks and their climatic relations in northern Sweden | The alpine treeline in northern Fennoscandia is composed primarily of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), a deciduous tree that experiences episodic defoliation due to outbreaks of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata). Here, we use an extensive dendroecological data set to reconstruct historic defoliating outbreaks and relate them to climatic conditions. Our data are from 25 sites in eight valleys in northern Sweden. We used the computer program OUTBREAK to reconstruct moth outbreaks. The reconstructed outbreak record matches the historical record well. There is a significant, but weak relationship between the outbreak severity and temperatures in February, April, July, and August of the outbreak year. Temperatures in the previous May and November were also positively correlated with outbreak severity. For seasonally aggregated temperatures, only autumn temperatures are correlated with outbreak severity. There was no significant correlation between NAO index and outbreak severity. A spatiotemporal semivariogram analysis showed that sites within approximately 100 km of each other show similar patterns in outbreak severity. Our analyses suggest that moths are affected by climatic variations. The influence of climate on outbreaks is weak because background climatic conditions alone cannot induce an outbreak. Outbreaks also depend on nonclimatic factors, such as tree age, and the outbreak status of neighboring areas. | ['cairn', 'lafon', 'moen', 'young'] | ","['cairn', 'lafon', 'moen', 'young']",3

93,"Growing Season Temperatures in Europe and Climate Forcings Over the Past 1400 Years | Background: The lack of instrumental data before the mid-19th-century limits our understanding of present warming trends. In the absence of direct measurements, we used proxies that are natural or historical archives recording past climatic changes. A gridded reconstruction of spring-summer temperature was produced for Europe based on tree-rings, documentaries, pollen assemblages and ice cores. The majority of proxy series have an annual resolution. For a better inference of long-term climate variation, they were completed by low-resolution data (decadal or more), mostly on pollen and ice-core data. Methodology/ Principal Findings: An original spectral analog method was devised to deal with this heterogeneous dataset, and to preserve long-term variations and the variability of temperature series. So we can replace the recent climate changes in a broader context of the past 1400 years. This preservation is possible because the method is not based on a calibration (regression) but on similarities between assemblages of proxies. The reconstruction of the April-September temperatures was validated with a Jack-knife technique. It was also compared to other spatially gridded temperature reconstructions, literature data, and glacier advance and retreat curves. We also attempted to relate the spatial distribution of European temperature anomalies to known solar and volcanic forcings. Conclusions: We found that our results were accurate back to 750. Cold periods prior to the 20(th) century can be explained partly by low solar activity and/or high volcanic activity. The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) could be correlated to higher solar activity. During the 20(th) century, however only anthropogenic forcing can explain the exceptionally high temperature rise. Warm periods of the Middle Age were spatially more heterogeneous than last decades, and then locally it could have been warmer. However, at the continental scale, the last decades were clearly warmer than any period of the last 1400 years. The heterogeneity of MWP versus the homogeneity of the last decades is likely an argument that different forcings could have operated. These results support the fact that we are living a climate change in Europe never seen in the past 1400 years. | ['corona', 'escarsel', 'guiot'] | ","['corona', 'escarsel', 'guiot']",3
94,"Growth dynamics of tree-line and lake-shore Scots pine (Pines sylvestris L.) in the central Scandinavian Mountains during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the early Little Ice Age | Trees growing at their altitudinal or latitudinal distribution in Fennoscandia have been widely used to reconstruct warm season temperatures, and the region hosts some of the world's longest tree-ring chronologies. These multi-millennial long chronologies have mainly been built from tree remains found in lakes (subfossil wood from lake-shore trees). We used a unique dataset of Scots pine tree-ring data collected from wood remains found on a mountain slope in the central Scandinavian Mountains, yielding a chronology spanning over much of the last 1200 years. This data was compared with a local subfossil wood chronology with the aim to (1) describe growth variability in two environments during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the early Little Ice Age (LIA), and (2) investigate differences in growth characteristics during these contrasting periods. It was shown that the local tree-line during both the MCA and early LIA was almost 150 m higher that at present. Based on living pines from the two environments, tree-line pine growth was strongly associated with mid-summer temperatures, while the lake-shore trees showed an additional response to summer precipitation. During the MCA, regarded to be a period of favorable climate in the region, the tree-ring data from both environments showed strong coherency and moderate growth variability. In the early LIA, the two chronologies were less coherent, with the tree-line chronology showing more variability, suggesting different growth responses in the two environments during this period of less favorable growing conditions. Our results indicate that tree-ring width chronologies mainly based on lake-shore trees may need to be re-evaluated. | ['bjorklund', 'farahat', 'fuentes', 'gunnarson', 'linderholm', 'liu', 'rocha', 'salo', 'seftigen', 'stridbeck', 'zhang'] | ","['bjorklund', 'farahat', 'fuentes', 'gunnarson', 'linderholm', 'liu', 'rocha', 'salo', 'seftigen', 'stridbeck', 'zhang']",3

What are the similarities between the temporal radial growth patterns of the two common shrub species, Alnus viridis and Salix glauca? Do changing growth conditions over the past 120yr and their predicted impact on growth match shrub expansion observed in the region?LocationArsuk Fjord and Disko Bay regions, W Greenland.MethodsAlnus viridis and S.glauca specimens were sampled in the field and radial growth was analysed using standard dendrochronological methods (response functions'). The identified climatic variables were applied to model radial growth using a linear mixed model and predict the growth for 1890-2010.ResultsThe main determinants of radial growth were summer temperatures and, although not significant in the final models, spring precipitation. The empirical chronologies showed only somewhat similar growth patterns. They responded to similar sets of climatic variables, but their similarity was weakened because of the low number of replicates and local differences in growth conditions. The similarity between predicted (modelled) chronologies was higher, which was related to the response to similar sets of climatic variables and high correlation between climatic variables across long distances.ConclusionOverall, estimated growth did not increase over the past 120yr, but considerable variations in growth are conspicuous and match known historical patterns of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Perspectives regarding the observed shrub expansion in W Greenland are discussed, and based on the estimated growth patterns, we consider it unlikely that the recent 10-15-yr period of favourable climate is the main responsible cause. | ['ahlgrimm', 'friemel', 'hallinger', 'jorgensen', 'kollmann', 'meilby'] | ","['ahlgrimm', 'friemel', 'hallinger', 'jorgensen', 'kollmann', 'meilby']",3

98,"Growth sensitivity to climate varies with soil moisture regime in spruce-fir forests in central British Columbia | Key message Growth sensitivity to climate varies with soil moisture regime in spruce-fir forests in central British Columbia. Stands growing at their dry edaphic limits displayed especially strong and unique climatic sensitivities. Soil moisture regime is an important influence of productivity, process, and structure in forested ecosystems. In western North America, projected warming trends may result in decreasing available soil moisture; however, the potential effects on forest growth remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the influence of stand-level soil moisture regime on the climatic sensitivity of mature hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca (Moensch) Voss x Picea engelmannii Parry) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) forests in central British Columbia, Canada. We collected and analyzed tree-ring data from 51 stands spanning a range of soil moisture regimes. Dendroecological analyses of climate-growth relationships indicated that warm summer temperatures and drought limit growth for both species across all soil moisture regimes; however, responses were strongest on the driest sites. Spruce populations across the gradient of soil moisture regimes displayed unique climate-growth relationships; growth in populations on wetter sites was more correlated with summer climate from the year prior to growth. Radial growth responses to prior summer temperatures strengthened over the past ca. 80 years in both species and across most sites, suggesting that climate-growth relationships are shifting in this region. This study presents evidence of the importance of considering site-level ecological factors such as soil moisture regime when studying forest growth responses to climate. | ['delong', 'foord', 'griesbauer', 'rogers'] | ","['delong', 'foord', 'griesbauer', 'rogers']",0
99,"Growth variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) along a west-east gradient across northern Fennoscandia: A dendroclimatic approach | We performed a spatiotemporal analysis of a network of 21 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) ring-width chronologies in northern Fennoscandia by means of chronology statistics and multivariate analyses. Chronologies are located on both sides (western and eastern) of the Scandes Mountains (67degreeN-70degreeN, 15degreeE-29degreeE). Growth relationships with temperature, precipitation, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices were calculated for the period 1880-1991. We also assessed their temporal stability. Current July temperature and, to a lesser degree, May precipitation are the main growth limiting factors in the whole area of study. However, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and mean interseries correlation revealed differences in radial growth between both sides of the Scandes Mountains, attributed to the Oceanic-Continental climatic gradient in the area. The gradient signal is temporally variable and has strengthened during the second half of the 20th century. Northern Fermoscandia Scots pine growth is positively related to early winter NAO indices previous to the growth season and to late spring NAO. NAO/growth relationships are unstable and have dropped in the second half of the 20th century. Moreover, they are noncontinuous through the range of NAO values: for early winter, only positive NAO indices enhance tree growth in the next growing season, while negative NAO does not. For spring, only negative NAO is correlated with radial growth. | ['eronen', 'gutierrez', 'kirchhefer', 'lindholm', 'macias', 'timonen'] | ","['eronen', 'gutierrez', 'kirchhefer', 'lindholm', 'macias', 'timonen']",0
100,"Gulf of Alaska atmosphere-ocean variability over recent centuries inferred from coastal tree-ring records | Eight tree-ring chronologies from coastal sites along the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) are used to develop a 227-year (1762-1988) reconstruction of spring/summer (March-September) coastal land temperatures for the region. This reconstruction explains 35% of the variance in the instrumental temperature data. The tree-ring records and reconstruction reflect the documented 1976 transition from cold to warm conditions in the North Pacific and are consistent with regional temperature compilations. Three of the eight ring-width series, from elevational timberline sites where trees are particularly stressed by temperature, extend back to A.D. 1600 and are used to identify additional occurrences of such transitions. The first principal component (PC) scores of these three longer records are positively correlated with spring (March-May) land and sea surface temperatures for the GOA region and are used to reconstruct land surface temperatures. Decadal-scale fluctuations in the reconstructions show agreement with decade-long changes in the intensity of the Aleutian Low pressure cell over the past century, suggesting that the tree-ring data may provide an index of past circulation changes for the northeast Pacific. Blackman-Tukey spectral analyses of both reconstructions indicate significant power at 7-11 years, with additional peaks at 3 years for the spring/summer reconstruction and 19 years for the longer spring temperature series. The modes of variation at about 3 and 7 years may correspond to those associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation bandwidth, whereas the 19-year term may relate to a proposed 20-year cycle of North Pacific circulation. The spring temperature series shows generally increased growth over the past century, coinciding with warmer spring temperatures in south coastal Alaska over this interval. Comparison with the entire spring series suggests that the recent warming exceeds temperature levels of prior centuries, extending back to A.D. 1600. | ['darrigo', 'jacoby', 'wile'] | ","['darrigo', 'jacoby', 'wile']",0
101,"Hale cyclicity of solar activity and its relation to climate variability | The periodicity of climatic processes along the Russian Arctic Ocean coast has been studied by analyzing the tree-ring chronologies for the regions close to the northern timberline. The wavelet analysis of annual series of conifer tree rings for the period 1458-1975 has revealed climatic oscillations with periods of 20-25 years. The amplitudes and periods of climatic oscillations in the region of Russian Arctic Ocean proved to exhibit appreciable changes. Especially strong climatic variations in comparison with the recent ones were found to occur during the Maunder minimum epoch when the period of oscillations increased from 22-23 years to 24-29 years, and oscillations with periods of 15 years appeared. After the Maunder minimum, the periods of oscillations and their amplitudes again decreased, and the 15-16-year maximum disappeared. Analysis of solar activity based on of radiocarbon (C-14) concentration in annual tree rings has revealed a similar pattern in changes of periodicity before, during, and after the Maunder minimum. This suggests that quasi-bidecadal climatic oscillations and variations in solar activity can be connected with each other. A possible solar forcing of periodic climatic processes and its nonlinear influence on the atmosphere-ocean-continental system are discussed. The intense quasi-bidecadal climatic oscillations can be, in all probability, interpreted as resulting from amplification of a weak solar signal in the atmosphere-ocean system that has its own noises whose frequencies are close to the 22-23-year solar cycles. | ['dergachev', 'kolstrom', 'raspopov'] | ","['dergachev', 'kolstrom', 'raspopov']",3

Mean July temperatures along this transect vary from 2.6 at the coast to 10.degree. C at the base of the foothills. Mean maximum heights of the sampled open-tundra willows increased from 10 .+-. 2 at the coast to 37 .+-. 8 cm at the southern end of the transect. Mean maximum heights of sampled streamside willows increased from 0 at the coast to 147 .+-. 25 cm.

Our final transfer model accounts for 31% of the dependent instrumental (mean June-August) temperature variance between 1908 and 2007. According to the 1263 yr long summer temperature proxy, the most severe summers were experienced in 1601, 1790 and 782. Correspondingly, the summers of 1689, 885 and 1123 were the most favourable for growth. Two drastic shifts in temperature variability were also found. The twentieth century experienced a multidecadal change as the cold 1905-1914 period was immediately followed by a warm period from 1915 to 1944. An even more prominent shift occurred in the Middle Ages, as the most severe cold spell during 1135-1164 was preceded by the warmest period only a decade earlier, during 1115-1124. The Fourier spectrum of the reconstruction shows significant concentrations of variance around 33.3, 23.3 and 11 years, and between 2.6 and 3.0 years. The wavelet spectrum was able to date several centres of fluctuating periodicities between 745 and 2007. Furthermore, daily temperature records allowed us to define the major growth forcing climatic factor in more detail than in previous response analyses.

104,"Hierarchical regression models for dendroclimatic standardization and climate reconstruction | Tree-ring based paleoclimate reconstructions entail several sequential estimation or processing steps. Consequently, it can be difficult to isolate climatic from non-climatic variability in the raw ring width measurements, estimate the uncertainty associated with a reconstruction, and directly infer how specific techniques used to sequentially fit growth curves or to reconstruct climate influence the final estimates. This paper explores the use of hierarchical regression models to address these problems. The proposed models simultaneously model the entire reconstruction process in a way that is consistent with the existing step-by-step estimation framework, but allow for uncertainty estimation and propagation across steps, which can help determine how best to improve a candidate model. The utility of hierarchical models is tested for an example, the reconstruction of summertime temperatures in northern Sweden in a cross-validated framework relative to 1) a sequential process of growth curve fitting followed by chronology development, 3) an iterative, ""signal-free"" approach, and 2) a signal-free regional curve standardization (RCS-SF). Further, an exploration of different structures within the unifying hierarchical framework is provided to illustrate how one could easily test a variety of choices of model design. We focus on a subset of choices relevant to recent dendroclimatic studies using hierarchical methods and related to 1) data transformation, 2) the benefits of biological detrending and climate reconstruction in a single step 3) partial pooling of the age model across trees, 4) the homogeneity of variance across tree-ring residuals, 5) the structural form of the age model, and 6) the inclusion of autoregressive processes for the tree-ring residuals. The work described here represents part of a series of ongoing explorations of potential advances over current dendroclimatic reconstruction approaches and commonly implemented ways in which they have and are specifically implemented. The results show that hierarchical modeling appears to offer improved climate reconstructions over the standardization techniques explored in this exercise, substantially so for the non-RCS sequential and iterative methods. | ['briffa', 'cook', 'lall', 'steinschneider'] | ","['briffa', 'cook', 'lall', 'steinschneider']",0
105,"Higher-than-present medieval pine (pinus sylvestris) treeline along the swedish scandes | The upper treeline of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is renowned as a sensitive indicator of climate change and variability. By use of megafossil tree remains, preserved exposed on the ground surface, treeline shift over the past millennium was investigated at multiple sites along the Scandes in northern Sweden. Difference in thermal level between the present and the Medieval period, about AD 1000-1200, is a central, although controversial, aspect concerning the detection and attribution of anthropogenic climate warming. Radiocarbon-dated megafossil pines revealed that the treeline was consistently positioned as much as 115 m higher during the Medieval period than today (AD 2000-2010), after a century of warming and substantial treeline upshift. Drawing on the last-mentioned figure, and a lapse rate of 0.6oC/100 m, it may be inferred that Medieval summer temperatures were about 0.7 oC warmer than much of the past 100 years. Extensive pine mortality and treeline descent after the Medieval warming peak reflect substantially depressed temperatures during the Little Ice Age. Warmer-than-present conditions during the Medieval period concur with temperature reconstructions from different parts of northern Fennoscandia, northwestern Russia and Greenland. Modern warming has not been sufficient to restore Medieval treelines. Against this background, there is little reason to view further modest warming as unnatural. ¬© The Authors. 2015. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],0

The analysis of correlation between tree ring chronologies and moving 20 day averages of air temperature and precipitation showed that in the upper part of the profi le at the timberline, a response of trees to air temperature was manifested 10 days later than in the lower part. The higher values of the radial increment and biometric characteristics of larch trees at the timberline (sparse forest-tundra) are suggested to be determined by the favorable hydrothermal properties of the soils. The results obtained support the concept that at the boundary with tundra on Taimyr Peninsula, there are relatively favorable conditions for the growth of larch irrelative of changes in the climate. –ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ –º–∏–∫—Ä–æ—ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–π –Ω–∞ –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫—É —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ì–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –≤–¥–æ–ª—å —Ç–æ–ø–æ-—ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—è, —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–º —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ä. –ö–æ—Ç—É–π –º–µ–∂- –¥—É –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ–π —Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ–ª–µ—Å—å–µ-—Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –∏ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ–π —Å–æ–º–∫–Ω—É—Ç—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤ (–ø-–æ–≤ –¢–∞–π–º—ã—Ä, 70¬Å52'53'' —Å.—à., 102¬Å58'26'' –≤.–¥.). –ù–∞ —Ç—Ä–µ—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–±–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥—è—Ö –≤ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–π, —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –∏ –Ω–∏–∂–Ω–µ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç—è—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—è –∏–∑–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—ã –±–∏–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –∏ —à–∏—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–ª–µ—Ü –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤; –¥–∞–Ω–∞ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫- —Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–æ-—Ö–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–≤–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤ –ø–æ—á–≤. –ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–ª—è—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –∏–Ω–¥–µ–∫—Å–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ-–∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–µ–≤—ã–º–∏ —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è–º–∏ –∏ —Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∑—è—â–∏–º–∏ –¥–≤–∞–¥—Ü–∞—Ç–∏–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω—ã- –º–∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–º–∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –≤–æ–∑–¥—É—Ö–∞ –∏ –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –≤ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—è –Ω–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ —Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ–ª–µ—Å—å–µ-—Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ —Ä–µ–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—É –≤–æ–∑–¥—É—Ö–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ –Ω–∞ 10 –¥–Ω–µ–π –ø–æ–∑–∂–µ, —á–µ–º –≤ –Ω–∏–∂–Ω–µ–π. –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –±o–ª—å—à–∞—è –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω—Å–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞- –¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –∏ –ª—É—á—à–∏–µ –±–∏–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –Ω–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ —Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ–ª–µ- —Å—å–µ-—Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–∞ –æ–±—É—Å–ª–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–Ω—ã–º–∏ –≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —Å–≤–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º–∏ –ø–æ—á–≤—ã. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –∞—Ä–≥—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –≤ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ü–∏–∏: –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö —ç–∫–æ—Ç–æ–Ω–∞ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ª–µ—Å–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø-–æ–≤–µ –¢–∞–π–º—ã—Ä –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è –¥–ª—è —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤–∑—Ä–æ—Å–ª—ã—Ö –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –≤ —Ä–µ–¥–∫–æ–ª–µ—Å—å—è—Ö, –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–∞—â–∏—Ö —Å —Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–π, —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞, –Ω–µ–∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ –æ—Ç —Ç–µ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–π –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞ (–ø–æ—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è). | ['benkova', 'naurzbaev', 'prokushkin', 'shashkin', 'simanko'] | ","['benkova', 'naurzbaev', 'prokushkin', 'shashkin', 'simanko']",0
109,"The importance of microecological conditions for growth of Larix gmelinii at the timberline on Taimyr Peninsula | The influence of microecological conditions on the dynamics of the radial increment of Larix gmelinii along a topographic-ecological profile located in the middle reach of the Kotui River at the timberline (sparse forest-tundra) was studied on Taimyr Peninsula (70 degrees 52'53"" N, 102 degrees 58'26""E).

110,"Indication of changes in hydrologic regime of the Lower Ob by means of tree ring analysis | The effect of natural and anthropogenic changes in the hydrologic regime of the Lower Ob on longterm dynamics of the radial tree increment was studied in the Oktyabr'skii natural floodplain region. Changes in the long-term dynamics of the radial increment in Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica (Rupr.) Mayr) that occurred since the 1950s were revealed at the boundary of the floodplain. These changes proved to be related to natural changes in the hydrologic regime of the Ob River (water level, maximum flood level) and in air temperature above the water area of the floodplain in summer. | ['agafonov'] | ",['agafonov'],1
111,"Influence of climate and soil hydrothermal regime on radial growth of Larix cajanderi and Pinus sylvestris in Central Yakutia, Russia | This paper presents the results of investigations of tree-ring growth in Dahurian larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Central Yakutia, Eastern Siberia. The study used dendrochronological methods to analyse the influence of climate on tree growth and forest development in a permafrost area. Three larch sites and one pine site were investigated. The duration of tree-ring chronologies at all four sites was more than 200 years. Analysis of soil temperature influences on radial increment was carried out for the period from 1934 to 2006. For dependence of larch growth from soil moisture content on different depths, the data since 1988 were used. The study demonstrated that tree growth was largely dependent on soil hydrothermal conditions. The results of statistical analyses indicated that the radial growth of Dahurian larch and Scots pine in Central Yakutia was significantly correlated with soil temperature and moisture at various depths. Correlations with soil temperature at the different depths were 0.4-0.5 (p0.05), especially during the winter period. Negative correlations with soil temperature were revealed in summer on the dry sites. Taking into account the droughty climate of Central Yakutia, soil moisture correlates well with the radial increment of trees (up to r=0.8, or higher). The highest correlation was revealed with the last year's autumn soil moisture. | ['desyatkin', 'fedorov', 'nikolaev'] | ","['desyatkin', 'fedorov', 'nikolaev']",2

113,"The Influence of Climatic Parameters on the Formation of Radial Growth of the Pine on the North Border of the Area of European North of Russia | Over the past decades there has been an in-crease in the amplitude of air temperature fluctua-tions. Forest ecosystems possess considerable stability and are capable of maintaining dynamic balance in a wide criteria range. The pine is a common forest variety in the European North of Russia. Tree reactions to environmental conditions in the north are manifested earlier and more pro-nounced. Radial increase is a complex indicator, allowing tracing the change in the state of the stand and climate. In pine forests on marshy peaty peat soils of the basin of the river of Mezen (Arkhan-gelsk Region) the studies on the variability of radial growth of Pinus sylvestris L. taking into account the climate were conducted. The method of the den-drochronological analysis received chronological ranks of radial gain of the pine for a long period. High amplitude of the oscillations of pine growth index was established. According to the ‚Äúsensitivity index‚Äù of individual series of the pine high values indicating the response of trees to excessive soil moistening were not established. The dynamics of ‚Äústress index‚Äù as readapting factor was positive and corresponded to the average level (past 30 years). The ranks of average annual air temperature, the amount of precipitation were analyzed and the trend in the increase in these parameters was es-tablished (on meteorological station ""Mezen""). The correlations between radial growth and air tempera-ture and the amount of precipitation of the previous and current year have not been revealed.

114,"Influence of larval outbreaks on the climate reconstruction potential of an Arctic shrub | Arctic shrubs have a strong potential for climate and environmental reconstructions in the chronically understudied regions of the high northern latitudes. The climate dynamics of these regions are important to understand because of large-scale feedbacks to the global climate system. However, little is known about other factors influencing shrub ring growth, possibly obscuring their climate signal. For example, as of yet we are not able to differentiate between herbivory or climatically induced growth depressions. Here, we use one of the most common Arctic shrubs, Alnus viridis as a test case to address this question. We sampled Alnus in Kobbefjord, Greenland, measured shrub-ring width and cell wall thickness and built site chronologies of each parameter. We analysed climate-growth relationships, tested their stability over time and employed a pointer-year analysis to detect growth depressions. We employed bootstrapped transfer function stability tests (BTFS) to assess the suitability of our shrub chronologies for climate reconstruction. Correlations with climate data showed strong significantly positive and stable correlations between summer temperature and ring-width with the exception of the recent decade. A climate reconstruction model failed stability tests, when the complete period of record was used for calibration and verification. Wood anatomy analysis uncovered the occurrence of unusual cell structure (very thin cell walls) in the exceptionally narrow ring of 2004, a recorded insect outbreak year in other parts of Greenland. When excluding the affected ring and a recovery period, the reconstruction model passed all tests, suggesting that the unusual 2004 ring was not climate driven, but rather the result of an insect attack. When combining anatomical analysis with traditional ring-width measurements, we move a step further in potentially distinguishing small rings caused by insect attacks from small rings formed in climatically challenging years. While this study does not provide unambiguous evidence, it does provide potential useful methodological combinations to enable more robust climate reconstructions in areas where climatic records are extremely sparse. | ['bura', 'lange', 'lehejcek', 'maaten', 'shetti', 'wilmking'] | ","['bura', 'lange', 'lehejcek', 'maaten', 'shetti', 'wilmking']",3
115,"Influence of micro-site conditions on tree-ring climate signals and trends in central and northern Sweden | Tree-ring chronologies are important indicators of pre-instrumental, natural climate variability. Some of the longest chronologies are from northern Fennoscandia, where ring width measurement series from living trees are combined with series from sub-fossil trees, preserved in shallow lakes, to form millennial-length records. We here assess the recent ends of such timeseries by comparing climate signals and growth characteristics in central and northern Sweden, of (1) trees growing at lakeshore micro-sites (representing the source of sub-fossil material of supra-long chronologies), with (2) trees collected in dryer micro-sites several meters ""inland"". Calibration trials reveal a predominating June-September temperature signal in N-Sweden and a weaker but significant May-September precipitation signal in C-Sweden. At the micro-site level, the temperature signal in N-Sweden is stronger in the lakeshore trees compared to the inland trees, whereas the precipitation signal in C-Sweden remains unchanged among the lakeshore and inland trees. Tree-rings at cambial ages > 40 years are also substantially wider in the lakeshore micro-site in C-Sweden, and juvenile rings are more variable (and wider) in the dryer micro-site in N-Sweden (compared to the adjacent micro-sites). By combining the data of the various micro-sites with relict samples spanning the past 1,000 years, we demonstrate that growth rate differences at the micro-site scale can affect the low frequency trends of millennial-length chronologies. For the supra-long chronologies from northern Fennoscandia, that are derived from sub-fossil lake material, it is recommended to combine these data with measurement series from only lakeshore trees. | ['duethorn', 'esper', 'holzkamper', 'timonen'] | ","['duethorn', 'esper', 'holzkamper', 'timonen']",3

Traditional dendrochronological methods of collection, preparation, and data processing were used. The differences in responses of the radial increment to air temperature in October and repeated disturbance of tree annual rings by frost were found in Siberian spruce and Siberian stone pine. These differences were related to the distance of the test sites from the Ob River banks. The relations between the radial tree growth and formation of annual rings disturbed by frost aganist the river streamflow are discussed. | ['agafonov', 'gurskaya'] | ","['agafonov', 'gurskaya']",2
117,"Integrating Dendroecology with Other Disciplines Improves Understanding of Upper and Latitudinal Treelines | Despite a consistent global relationship between the position of alpine and arctic treeline and temperature, fine-scale variability in treeline response to climate is widespread. In this chapter, we describe two advances in the application of dendroecology to treeline environments. First, we show that obtaining detailed, spatially explicit measurements of the environment can provide a more complete picture of how tree growth responds to climate. Substantial topoclimatic and environmental heterogeneity can occur at a very fine scale, a few tens of meters, at treeline. Unlike traditional approaches that aggregate tree growth across relatively broad areas, applying the approaches of landscape ecology and quantifying this heterogeneity can allow dendroecologists to better understand fine-scale, within-population variation in climate response. Second, the integration of dendroecological approaches with physiological ecology and soil biogeochemical studies can provide a more holistic understanding of tree growth, one that approaches trees as not merely being the sum of their rings, but as complex organisms whose growth integrates the impact of multiple limiting factors filtered through distinct physiological processes. In regions with cold soils, for example, we show that nutrient limitation can strongly mediate the response of tree growth to climate warming. Together, these approaches allow us to understand the causes of fine-scale variation in treeline response to warming, reconcile that variation with global-scale correlations between treeline and temperature, and better predict future responses of treeline ecosystems to warming. | ['bunn', 'lloyd', 'sullivan'] | ","['bunn', 'lloyd', 'sullivan']",0
118,"Inter- and intra-seasonal effects of temperature variation on radial growth of alpine treeline Norway spruce | A widely accepted standpoint contends that plant growth near the cold edge of the species range, such as treelines, does not depend on the annual temperature seasonality (i.e. difference between maximum and minimum temperature values) but rather on the warmth of summer season. In contrast to this expectation, we show that the growth of treeline Norway spruce (Picea abies) is well explained by temperature seasonality as a single climatic determinant. To do so, the tree-ring data of spruce trees growing on alpine treeline in Lapland was compared with long climate records. Biennial time-series of temperature seasonality capture both the decadal and abrupt growth fluctuations with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.601. We also show that the archetypal association between summer temperature and treeline tree growth may in fact be by far a more complex relationship than previously thought. Spruce growth appears responsive to late- June (r = 0.494) and mid-July (r = 0.310) temperatures but unresponsive to temperatures during the early July, that is, during the grand period of the tracheid formation. Climatic warming may enhance the treeline spruce growth unless the warming is concentrated on unresponsive interval in the midst of the growing season. Water relations did not play significant role as agents of P. abies growth. | ['helama', 'sutinen'] | ","['helama', 'sutinen']",0
119,"Interannual to decadal changes in area burned in Canada from 1781 to 1982 and the relationship to Northern Hemisphere land temperatures | Aim Temporal variability of annual area burned in Canada (AAB-Can) from (AD) 1781 to 1982 is inferred from tree-ring width data. Next, correlation analysis is applied between the AAB-Can estimates and Northern Hemisphere (NH) warm season land temperatures to link recent interannual to decadal changes in area burned with large-scale climate variations. The rationale in this use of tree rings is that annual radial increments produced by trees can approximate area burned through sensing climate variations that promote fire activity.Location The statistical reconstruction of area burned is at the scale of Canada.Methods The data base of total area burned per year in Canada is used as the predictand. A set of 53 multicentury tree-ring width chronologies distributed across Canada is used as predictors. A linear model relating the predictand to the tree-ring predictors is fitted over the period 1920-82. The regression coefficients estimated for the calibration period are applied to the tree-ring predictors for as far back as 1781 to produce a series of AAB-Can estimates.Results The AAB-Can estimates account for 44.1% of the variance in the observed data recorded from 1920 to 1982 (92.2% after decadal smoothing) and were verified using a split sample calibration-verification scheme. The statistical reconstruction indicates that the positive trend in AAB-Can from c. 1970-82 was preceded by three decades during which area burned was at its lowest during the past 180 years. Correlation analysis with NH warm season land temperatures from the late 18th century to the present revealed a positive statistical association with these estimates.Main conclusions As with previous studies, it is demonstrated that the upward trend in AAB-Can is unlikely to be an artefact from changing fire reporting practices and may have been driven by large-scale climate variations. | ['girardin'] | ",['girardin'],2
120,"Intra-Annual Climate Anomalies in Northwestern North America Following the 1783‚Äì1784 CE Laki Eruption | The 1783‚Äì1784 CE Laki eruption in Iceland was one of the largest, in terms of the mass of SO2 emitted, high-latitude eruptions in the last millennium, but the seasonal and regional climate response was heterogeneous in space and time. Although the eruption did not begin until early June, tree-ring maximum latewood density (MXD) reconstructions from Alaska suggest that the entire 1783 summer was extraordinarily cold. We use high-resolution quantitative wood anatomy, climate model simulations, and proxy systems modeling to resolve the intra-annual climate effects of the Laki eruption on temperatures over northwestern North America. We measured wood anatomical characteristics of white spruce (Picea glauca) trees from two northern Alaska sites. Earlywood cell characteristics of the 1783 ring are normal, while latewood cell wall thickness is significantly and anomalously reduced compared to non-eruption years. Combined with complementary evidence from climate model experiments and proxy systems modeling, these features indicate an abrupt and premature cessation of cell wall thickening due to a rapid temperature decrease toward the end of the growing season. Reconstructions using conventional annual resolution MXD likely over-estimate total growing season cooling in this year, while ring width fails to capture this abrupt late-summer volcanic signal. Our study has implications not only for the interpretation of the climatic impacts of the Laki eruption in North America, but more broadly demonstrates the importance of timing and internal variability when comparing proxy temperature reconstructions and climate model simulations. It further demonstrates the value of developing cellular-scale tree-ring proxy measurements for paleoclimatology. ¬© 2020. American Geophysical Union.

121,"An investigation of the snowpack signal in moisture-sensitive trees from the Southern Canadian Cordillera | Variations in mountain snowpack in the western Canadian Cordillera have widespread and important impacts on ecosystems, environmental processes and socio-economic activities (e.g. water availability downstream). Historical records of snowpack generally span only the latter half of the 20th century offering a limited perspective on the causes and uniqueness of recently observed changes across the region. This paper explores the potential utility of a network of low elevation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) tree ring-width chronologies to reconstruct past snow pack variations. Correlation coefficients between the tree-ring chronologies and a set of snow water equivalent (SWE) records are calculated and mapped. Separate analyses were carried out for total ring width (TRW) and partial-ring measurements (earlywood and latewood; EW and LW). A set of Adjusted LW chronologies was also developed; in these, the relationship between LW and the preceding EW width has been removed. The ring-width chronologies exhibit moderately strong relationships with SWE records from the western Canadian Cordillera and these relationships vary in sign across the region. Distinctive regional groups are identified where chronologies exhibit same-sign correlations with SWE, in possible accordance with the elevation and characteristics of the tree-ring chronology sample sites. The EW chronologies correlate more strongly and consistently with SWE records in regions where the growth relationship with SWE is negative. The LW chronologies, and particularly the Adjusted LW chronologies, exhibit a greater number of positive correlations with the set of SWE records. Collectively these results offer valuable insights for developing a targeted sampling and/or reconstruction strategy that can exploit these different relationships with SWE to generate more robust estimates of pre-instrumental snowpack for the region.

122,"The Laki eruption and observed dendroclimatic effects of volcanism C3 - Geophysical Monograph Series | The year of the Laki eruption, 1783, is the most visibly obvious anomaly in the northwestern Alaska tree-ring record for over 400 years or more. Thicker-walled, latewood cells formed late in the growing season are virtually absent. Quantitatively the latewood density is over 4 standard deviations below the mean latewood density of white spruce (Picea glauca) trees from northwest Alaska; indication of extreme cold during the summer season in this region. The tree-ring response to the event weakens toward the east, indicating that extreme cold did not extend much beyond the Mackenzie River in western Canada or very far south of the Alaska Range in central Alaska. To understand the tree-ring effects due to the Laki eruption, it is helpful to also consider three other similar events in 1641, 1816-17, and 1836. In each case there is evidence of extreme cold causing very low density latewood in the rings of white spruce near the latitudinal treeline. The effects in the tree-ring record are spatially variable. Evidence of extreme cold typically extends for about 60¬∞-70¬∞ of longitude; 1641 in north western-and-central Canada, 1783 in Alaska, 1816-17 in eastern Canada, and 1836 in north-central Canada. One interpretation of this spatial and temporal pattern is that in addition to general cooling, the thermal effects of volcanic events can lead to outbreaks of extremely cold polar air on a regional basis. This interpretation is compatible with air mass trajectories driven by Rossby wave circulation. Such extreme regional cooling can have great impact on human conditions. ¬© 2003 by the American Geophysical Union. | ['darrigo', 'jacoby'] | ","['darrigo', 'jacoby']",3
123,"Landsat TM/ETM plus and tree-ring based assessment of spatiotemporal patterns of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) in northernmost Fennoscandia | We used fine-spatial resolution remotely sensed data combined with tree-ring parameters in order to assess and reconstruct disturbances. in mountain birch (Betula pubescens) forests caused by Epirrita autumnato (autumnal moth). Research was conducted in the area of Lake Tornetrisk in northern Sweden where we utilized five proxy parameters to detect insect outbreak events over the 19th and 20th centuries. Digital change detection was applied on three pairs of multi-temporal NDVI images from Landsat TM/ETM+ to detect significant reductions in the photosynthetic activity of forested areas during disturbed growing seasons. An image segmentation gap-fill procedure was developed in order to compensate missing scan lines in Landsat ETM+ ""SLC-off"" images. To account for a potential dependence of local outbreak levels on elevation, a digital elevation model was included in the defoliation recognition process. The resulting damage distribution map allowed for the assessment of outbreak intensity and distribution at the stand level and was combined with tree-ring data and historical documents to produce a multi-evidence outbreak detection. Defoliation events in the tree-ring data were recognized as significant deviations from temperature related growth.Our outbreak detection scheme allowed for the reconstruction of nine major insect outbreaks over the past two centuries. The reconstruction proved reliable but only robust for severe defoliation events. Low-intensity incidents were not captured. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

124,"A large-scale coherent signal of canopy status in maximum latewood density of tree rings at arctic treeline in North America | We compared tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies to remotely sensed indices of productivity (NDVI) and snowmelt since 1981 and to the instrumental temperature record at four arctic treeline sites in North America. Our results show that at these sites, TRW chronologies reflect temperatures less consistently than the MXD chronologies do and that the NDVI does not correlate significantly with TRW at high-frequency, i.e. when comparing yearly values. In contrast, the MXD chronologies correlate positively and significantly with NDVI and temperature during the growing season at all sites. Neither TRW or MXD chronologies appeared consistently influenced by the annual timing of snowmelt A comparison of tree-ring chronologies and temperatures since 1900 confirms that MXD has tracked growing season temperature at these treeline sites throughout the past century. A spatial evaluation of the correlations further reveals that each of the MXD chronologies investigated here reflects interannual variation in NDVI and growing season temperatures across a large geographic region. As a result they collectively provide a spatially comprehensive record of historic early-season canopy status as well as growing season temperatures for the high latitudes of North America.

125,"Late-Quaternary summer temperature changes in the northern-European tree-line region | We present two new quantitative July mean temperature (T-jul) reconstructions from the Arctic tree-line region in the Kola Peninsula in north-western Russia. The reconstructions are based on fossil pollen records and cover the Younger Dryas stadial and the Holocene. The inferred temperatures are less reliable during the Younger Dryas because of the poorer fit between the fossil pollen samples and the modem samples in the calibration set than during the Holocene. The results suggest that the Younger Dryas T-jul in the region was 8.0-10.0 degrees C, being 2.0-3.0 degrees C lower than at present. The Holocene summer temperature maximum dates to 7500-6500 cat yr BP, with T-jul about 1.5 degrees C higher than at present. These new records contribute to our understanding of summer temperature changes along the northem-European tree-line region. The Holocene trends are consistent in most of the independent records from the Fennoscandian-Kola tree-line region, with the beginning of the Holocene thermal maximum no sooner than at about 8000 cat yr BR In the few existing temperature-related records farther east in the Russian Arctic tree line, the period of highest summer temperature begins already at about 10,000 cat yr BP. This difference may reflect the strong influence of the Atlantic coastal current on the atmospheric circulation pattern and the thermal behaviour of the tree-line region on the Atlantic seaboard, and the more direct influence of the summer solar insolation on summer temperature in the region east of the Kola Peninsula.

126,"Late Holocene Reproductional Patterns of Pinus-Sylvestris and Picea-Abies at the Forest Limit in Central Sweden | The age structure was studied of two stands of Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst. growing on ""fire-safe"", opposing (north- and south-facing, respectively) slopes at the forest limit in the Scandes Mountains, in central Sweden. It is suggested that the spatial species segregation is due to different microclimatic demands during seedling establishment and early survival stages. Establishment of one correlated positively with the mean ""tetraterm' (June-September) air temperature over 20-year periods (1861-1980). A sequence of thermally favourable years appears to be important for population net growth at the forest limit. Establishment of spruce may relate to an absence of early summer drought, stable snow cover during the winter, and certain high-temperature demands for seed maturation. The extant pine population died off almost entirely during the climatic deterioration of the Little Ice age (prior to A.D. 1700). From the mid-18th century onwards a new pine population was established, the seed parents being the few remaining survivors from the foregoing decimation. This process confirms broadly with the known pattern of climatic change. After the climax of the Little Ice Age spruce colonized new territory, a consequence of the summer warming combined with the still fairly humid conditions in early summer. No spruce established during the climax phase of warming during the 20th century (A.D. 1925-1940). | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],2
127,"A High Late Holocene Tree-Limit and the Establishment of the Spruce Forest-Limit a Case Study in Northern Sweden | Radiocarbon dates of subfossil pines found on dry ground above the present-day tree-limit are reported from northern Sweden. The uppermost and oldest specimen germinated c. AD 300-600. During some shorter part of this interval the tree-limit might have been 235 m higher than it was at the turn of the last century. Based on a current adiabatic lapse rate of 0.7.degree. C per 100 m, it may be tentatively deduced that the summers were at least 1.6.degree. C warmer. The pine-tree-limit and upper pine populations are inferred to have declined substantially shortly after AD 600. The tree-limit reached a low at the end of the Little Ice Age. In parallel with the warming of c. 1.degree. C during the first half of the 20th century the tree-limit advanced 110 m altitudinally. Spruce forest dominance seems to have increased at the study site during the first half of the 19th century, when thermal and hygric conditions may have been optimally balanced. Although basically a direct climatic response, it can be hypothesized that the spruce expansion was facilitated by the pine demise during the Little Ice Age. | ['engelmark', 'kullman'] | ","['engelmark', 'kullman']",0
128,"Light rings as bioindicators of climate change in Interior North America | In light of the recent cool summers observed in Interior North America (INA), it is important to put these events into a longer term context of climate variability and change. Due to the limited coverage of meteorological stations and to the near absence of temperature-sensitive bio-environmental indicators in INA, we conducted studies of temperature-sensitive light-ring (LR) chronologies. Five LR chronologies were developed from 1167 jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) trees growing along a ca. 675 km latitudinal transect in INA. Each chronology represents the annual variability in the proportion (rho) of tree-ring samples identified as LR (hereafter rho LR) and covers the last two to three centuries. Years recording high rho LR were synchronous across the transect with southern and northern regions showing common variability. In each region and for the instrumental period, both late spring and late summer temperatures (particularly daytime maximum temperatures) were significantly cooler (1 to 2 degrees C) in years with high rho LR compared with low rho LR years. These temperature anomalies were associated with increased cyclonic activity over much of central Canada. Changes in the occurrence rate of LR years (rho >= 2%) were analyzed using kernel-density functions and bootstrap confidence bands. The distribution of LRs in the south provided little evidence of reduced occurrence in the last 250 years, suggesting there were no long-term linear changes in years marked by cool late springs and late summers. In contrast, the northern chronology provided evidence of a decreasing occurrence rate of LR years from 1830 to the present. These results support prior evidence of a response of trees to ongoing environmental changes in northern regions. However, they also illustrate the spatial complexity in these responses.

129,"Do limiting factors at Alaskan treelines shift with climatic regimes? | Trees at Alaskan treelines are assumed to be limited by temperature and to expand upslope and/or to higher latitudes with global warming. However, recent studies describe negative temperature responses and drought stress of Alaskan treeline trees in recent decades. In this study, we have analyzed the responses of treeline white spruce to temperature and precipitation according to different climatic regimes in Alaska, described as negative (cool) and positive (warm) phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We found that in three consecutive phases (positive from 1925-46, negative from 1947-76, and positive again from 1977-98), the growth responses to temperature and precipitation differed markedly. Before 1947, in a phase of warm winters and with summer temperatures being close to the century mean, the trees at most sites responded positively to summer temperature, as one would expect from treeline trees at northern high latitudes. Between 1947 and 1976, a phase of cold winters and average summers, the trees showed similar responses, but a new pattern of negative responses to the summer temperature of the year prior to growth coupled with positive responses to the precipitation in the same year emerged at some sites. As the precipitation was relatively low at those sites, we assume that drought stress might have played a role. However, the climate responses were not uniform but were modified by regional gradients (trees at northern sites responded more often to temperature than trees at southern sites) and local site conditions (forest trees responded more often to precipitation than treeline trees), possibly reflecting differences in energy and water balance across regions and sites, respectively. However, since the shift in the PDO in 1976 from a negative to a positive phase, the trees' climate-growth responses are much less pronounced and climate seems to have lost its importance as a limiting factor for the growth of treeline white spruce. If predictions of continued warming and precipitation increase at northern high latitudes hold true, the growth of Alaskan treeline trees will likely depend on the ratio of temperature and precipitation increase more than on their absolute values, as well as on the interaction of periodic regime shifts with the global warming trend. Once a climatic limitation is lifted, other factors, such as insect outbreaks or interspecific competition, might become limiting to tree growth. | ['jansen', 'ohse', 'wilmking'] | ","['jansen', 'ohse', 'wilmking']",4
130,"Linking two centuries of tree growth and glacier dynamics with climate changes in Kamchatka | Glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed substantially. For the majority of alpine and arctic areas, however, the lack of meteorological data over a long period makes it difficult to build long-term climate and glacial fluctuation relationships, emphasizing the importance of natural proxy archives. Here we use the 230-year record of stem radial growth of birch trees (Betula ermanii) from the treeline forests above the receding glaciers in eastern maritime Kamchatka to analyse temporal variations of climate as well as glacial advance and retreat. Glaciers in Kamchatka Peninsula represent the southern limit of glaciation in far eastern Eurasia, which makes them prone to global warming. Using instrumental climate data (1930-1996) from local meteorological stations, we find that the July temperature had most prominent positive impact on birch growth. On the contrary, smaller ring increments are associated with the positive summer and net annual ice mass balance of Koryto Glacier. The prevailing trend of higher summer temperatures and lower snowfall over the past 70 years has enhanced tree growth while causing the glacier's surface to lower by about 35 m and its front to retreat by about 490 m. Assuming these same relationships between climate, tree growth, and glacier mass balance also existed in the past, we use tree rings as a proxy record of climatically induced temporary halts in the glacier's retreat over the past two centuries, which in total was over 1,000 m. Both direct observations and tree ring proxies indicate several prolonged warm periods (1990s, 1960s, 1930-1940s, 1880-1900s) interspersed with cooler periods (1984-1985, 1970-1976, 1953-1957, 1912-1926, 1855-1875, 1830-1845, 1805-1820 and 1770-1780) when the glacier re-advanced, creating several consecutive terminal moraine ridges. We conclude that birch tree-rings are suitable for assessing tree growth/climate/glacial relationships over a longer timescale in maritime Kamchatka. | ['altman', 'dolezal', 'hara', 'vetrova'] | ","['altman', 'dolezal', 'hara', 'vetrova']",3
131,"A 250-year-long height-increment chronology for Pinus sylvestris at the northern coniferous timberline: A novel tool for reconstructing past summer temperatures? | A 250-year-long chronology of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) height increment was reconstructed for the northern timberline based on material collected from four stands in Lapland: Finland and Sweden. The height increment of pine was lower in the 18th and 19th centuries than in the second half of the 20th century. The amount of common variability was 38% in the old material and 44% in the material representing the 20th century. In the latter case, half of the common variability was explained by the mean July temperature of the previous year, but the data representing earlier centuries correlated less strongly with the July temperature. We can conclude that due to a strong common signal, height-increment series are a promising tool for reconstructing summer temperature on the regional scale at the northern timberline. Because of the ongoing global warming, information on past tree-height increment could improve predictions about the possible changes in timberline ecosystems. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

132,"Long-term decreasing trend in forest fires in northwestern Canada | The annual area of forest burned has decreased in recent centuries over large areas of Fennoscandia, Siberia and temperate North America. To determine if this same trend extends to a sparsely populated region of northern Canada, fire scars on living and dead trees, forest stand ages and charred wood were systematically sampled in 85 study plots in an area of 564 000 km 2 in northwestern Canada. A significant negative trend in the occurrence of forest fires was observed: average area burned per year decreased from 2.0% in the first half of the 19th century to 0.33% in the later half of the 20th century. Annually burned areas correlated significantly with a local tree ring based index, July monthly drought code and the Pacific decadal oscillation but not with June-August mean temperature, distance to the nearest road, or the year of road building. None of the climatic indicators or access history (indicative of the start of local fire suppression) could explain the long-term negative trend in fires. Earlier interpretations that humans dominated the causes of forest fires in the past, even in sparsely populated regions, deserve further attention as a possible explanation for the decreasing trend in fires. | ['burton', 'pennanen', 'wallenius'] | ","['burton', 'pennanen', 'wallenius']",0
133,"Long-term recruitment dynamics of arctic dwarf shrub communities in coastal east Greenland | Warming-induced biological and ecological responses have been reported from high-northern latitude sites, where changes in dwarf shrub communities translate into complex vegetation-climate feedbacks. Most of the available Arctic tree-ring evidence is, however, restricted to a limited number of species and locations. A combination of wood anatomical and 'dendro'-ecological techniques provides insights into past growth rates, recruitment dynamics and even community assemblages of Arctic vegetation. Here, we use thin sectioning and ring counting of 1432 dwarf shrub samples from eight species and two tundra regions in coastal east Greenland to assess community recruitment history and its relation to climate. Site and species-specific annual stem increments, as well as estimated plant ages, range from 0.013-0.720 mm and from 4 to 204 years, respectively. The mean ring width is 0.086 mm, with a mean age of 50 years.

We demonstrate that carefully selected tree-ring chronologies from 14 sites in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics can preserve such coherent large-scale, multicentennial temperature trends if proper methods of analysis are used.

136,"Mixed temperature-moisture signal in Œ¥18 o records of boreal conifers from the permafrost zone | Global climatic changes have been observed for all natural biomes, with the greatest impact in the permafrost zone. The short series of direct observations of air temperature and precipitation from meteorological stations for this territory make it difficult to use them in studies of the impact of climate change on forest and forest-tundra ecosystems, but only longer series of gridded data expand the temporal-spatial resolution of this analysis. We compared local and gridded air temperature, precipitation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) data, analyzed the trends of their changes over the last century for three sites in the permafrost zone (YAK and TAY in Russia, and CAN in Canada), and estimated the effect of their variability on oxygen isotopes in the tree-ring cellulose (Œ¥18 Ocell ) of three different species (Larix cajanderi Mayr, Larix gmelinii Rupr.

The reconstruction is performed using a novel ensemble method, Ensemble-LOC, designed to preserve low-frequency variability and minimize the influence of the ""spurious correlation"" between the proxy and instrumental data. The reconstruction is based on a set of 22 proxy records with annual resolution. We find clear evidences for a cold anomaly AD similar to 630 to 770 related to the Dark Age Cold Period, a warm anomaly similar to 950 to 1050 related to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and a cold anomaly similar to 1200 to 1900 related to the Little Ice Age. The strong 20th century warming is also evident. There are 3 different and distinct warm periods occurring during the Little Ice Age: 1470-1510, 1550-1570, and 1750-1770. However, about half of the total input proxies are not used in the large majority of the reconstructions.

138,"A 1200-year multiproxy record of tree growth and summer temperature at the northern pine forest limit of Europe | Combining nine tree growth proxies from four sites, from the west coast of Norway to the Kola Peninsula of NW Russia, provides a well replicated (> 100 annual measurements per year) mean index of tree growth over the last 1200 years that represents the growth of much of the northern pine timberline forests of northern Fennoscandia. The simple mean of the nine series, z-scored over their common period, correlates strongly with mean June to August temperature averaged over this region (r = 0.81), allowing reconstructions of summer temperature based on regression and variance scaling. The reconstructions correlate significantly with gridded summer temperatures across the whole of Fennoscandia, extending north across Svalbard and south into Denmark. Uncertainty in the reconstructions is estimated by combining the uncertainty in mean tree growth with the uncertainty in the regression models. Over the last seven centuries the uncertainty is < 4.5% higher than in the 20th century, and reaches a maximum of 12% above recent levels during the 10th century. The results suggest that the 20th century was the warmest of the last 1200 years, but that it was not significantly different from the 11th century. The coldest century was the 17th. The impact of volcanic eruptions is clear, and a delayed recovery from pairs or multiple eruptions suggests the presence of some positive feedback mechanism.

139,"Nao and sea surface temperature signatures in tree-ring records from the North Atlantic sector | Temperature-sensitive tree-ring chronologies from Scandinavia and Labrador are, respectively, analyzed for their response to two major features of North Atlantic climate variability: (1) the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and (2) Coastal and near-coastal surface air and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). (1) NAO: Using superposed epoch analysis (SEA), below (above) average ring-width departures from Scandinavian scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were found to follow positive (negative) anomalies in winter (December-February) sea level pressure (SLP) related to the Icelandic low pressure cell, a key element of the NAO. In addition to a documented summer temperature relationship, these trees show a positive correlation with winter temperatures for Oslo, Norway. Oslo data are used to define the northwest European end of the winter temperature seesaw, another major feature of the NAO. Below (above) average tree-growth departures tend to follow Greenland Above, GA or (Greenland Below, GB) seesaw winters, which are associated with high (low) pressure and cold (warm) conditions over Scandinavia.

An alternative model, based on only two chronologies, allows extension of these reconstructions back to 1713. The reconstructions explain about 45% of the temperature variance from 1915-1988 and pass several tests for model validation with high levels of statistical significance.

140,"Northern European summer temperature variations over the Common Era from integrated tree-ring density records | Tree-ring chronologies of maximum latewood density are most suitable to reconstruct annually resolved summer temperature variations of the late Holocene. The two longest such chronologies have been developed in northern Europe stretching back to the 2nd century BC, and the 5th century AD. We show where similarities between the two chronologies exist, and combine portions of both into a new summer temperature reconstruction for the Common Era. To minimize the transfer of potential biases, we assess the contribution of the candidate reconstructions' measurements, and exclude data (i) from exceptionally young and old trees, and (ii) produced by different laboratory technologies. Our new composite reconstruction reveals warmer conditions during Roman, Medieval and recent times, separated by prolonged cooling during the Migration period and Little Ice Age. Twentieth century warmth, as indicated in one of the existing density records, is reduced in the new reconstruction, also affecting the overall, millennial-scale, cooling trend over the late Holocene (-0.30 degrees C per 1000 years). Due to the reduced biological memory, typical for tree-ring density measurements, the new reconstruction is most suitable for evaluating the rate and speed of abrupt summer cooling following large volcanic eruptions.

141,"Northern North American tree-ring evidence for regional temperature changes after major volcanic events | Maximum latewood density data from trees at thirteen temperature-sensitive sites along the northern treeline of North America are used to evaluate the spatial patterns of response to four known volcanic events just prior to the period of modern observations: in 1640, 1783, 1815 and 1835. A previously unknown event is also postulated for 1699. This tree-ring density parameter is used because it shows a stronger and more consistent short-term, temperature-related volcanic signal than ring width. Normalized density departures following these events vary in sign and magnitude from region to region, with the coldest summer conditions inferred for the Northwest Territories in 1641, Alaska in 1783, Quebec and Labrador in 1816 and the Northwest Territories in 1836. For these as well as other events, low density values are often among the most extreme on record at their respective locations.

142,"Observed continentality in radial growth-climate relationships in a twelve site network in western Labrador, Canada | Despite their suitability for dendroclimatological research, the boreal regions of central and western Labrador remain under-researched. In an attempt to evaluate the growth trends and climatic response of this region's trees, master chronologies have been developed for its four dominant conifer species. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns, Poggenb.) and eastern larch (Larix laricina (DuRoi) K. Koch) were sampled systematically within a 3 x 4 grid of twelve sites at the intersection of 62 degrees W, 64 degrees W and 66 degrees W longitude, and latitudes 52 degrees N, 53 degrees N, 54 degrees N and 55 degrees N. The two most dominant species at each site were sampled, yielding a total of twenty-four master chronologies, all of which reflected a highly significant common signal at each site. The chronologies were subjected to a response function analysis to determine the nature of the growth-climate relationships in the region. Summer temperature proved to be the predominant limiting factor with regard to radial growth at most sites. The onset of the optimum temperature regime, however, varies across the network of sites, revealing evidence of a gradient of continentality in the data. Growth-temperature correlations indicated a significant relationship with July temperature at most eastern sites, while western sites tended to correlate with May, June and August temperatures. Central sites tended to correlate with June-July temperatures. We interpret these results as demonstrating the bioclimatic gradient of change between coastally proximal, maritime-influenced sites and inland, continentally influenced locales. This transition occurs approximately 330 km inland from the open Labrador Sea. (C) 2010 Istituto Italian di Dendrocronologia. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Internal shell-growth increments, showing annual periodicity, provided information about the ontogenetic age and growth of the mussels. Increment widths generally ranged between 0.4 mm and 30 gm and showed exponential growth trends. Moreover, it was shown that the increment series of different specimens could be temporally synchronized by their common growth signal. This enabled crossdating of the increment series, after which they were averaged into one sclerochronology. One of the shells showed past growth disturbance due to breakage of the shell. Subsequent growth increase, not obsereved in the other shells, had occurred over the next 5 to 8 years. The oldest specimen exhibited 162 annual increments. Considering the width of the umbonal corrosion and the widths of the increments next to the corrosion, the loss of 17 young increments could be estimated. Moreover, a number of four years was added to the age estimate due to presumably minimal shell growth during the early post-parasitic years. Our results indicate that, if not anthropogenically disturbed, super-centenarian ages may not be a rarity in the region and the oldest mussels may reach an age of even two centuries. | ['helama', 'valovirta'] | ","['helama', 'valovirta']",2

Based on the data of instrumental observations on daily air temperature, the dates and rates of temperature decrease in the years of pathological tree ring formation were analyzed. The recurrence and intensity of extreme temperature drops during the growing seasons of the past six centuries were reconstructed.

148,"Peatland pines as climate indicators? A regional comparison of the climatic influence on Scots pine growth in Sweden | Six tree-ring chronologies from Sweden were analyzed to assess if Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing on peatlands are useful as annually resolved climate indicators. Also, climate-growth relationships were compared with those of pines growing on nearby dry sites to evaluate if pines from both environments may be combined to yield climate information. While temperatures in spring and summer had positive influences on peatland pine growth, precipitation responses ranged from negative in the north to positive in the south. Climate - growth response patterns differed between peatland and neighboring dry sites, where climatic information in peatland pines was weaker. Added to the direct effect of growth-year climate, is the response of peatland pines to water table variations, a function of climate over several years, likely causing annual growth to reflect a synthesis of climate over a long period. Scots pine climate - growth responses, in both environments, changed throughout the 20th century, corresponding to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns in Sweden. Decreasing growth trends since the late 1970s may be a result of late 20th century change to a warmer and wetter climate, possibly related to a strengthening of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in recent decades. | ['grudd', 'linderholm', 'moberg'] | ","['grudd', 'linderholm', 'moberg']",0

150,"Periodicity of warmth and humidity correlation in taiga geocomplexes of the European North of Russia, according to dendrochronological data | The article observes the analysis of the dendrochronological research data relating to taiga geocomplexes of the European North of Russia. Rated indexes of the tree-ring series (annual growth gain of coniferous tree rings) are being cross-referenced with the climatic data from the weather stations of the explored region, with the average atmospheric temperatures and precipitation rates of various periods. Statistical analysis of the compared data has been conducted: cross-correlational, autocorrelational, spectral. Also, we have figured out the rhythmicity of tree rings growth gain fluctuation during the period of time equal to the age of stand, up to 450 years, using historical trees as well, up to 637 years old. Phase shifts in growth gain reaction were defined. It has been stated, that there is a weak direct correlation between growth gain of the tree rings and the temperature and precipitation rates in taiga geocomplexes of the European North of Russia. Nevertheless, graph motions of dendrochronological and meteorological data of the warm period show coherence; their steadiness was estimated autocorrelationally, and the significant period covered approximately 20 years - i.e., growth gain of the tree rings is quite stable. Due to this fact, it is possible to conclude that natural processes are highly predictable. With the help of spectral analysis conducted, we evaluated interconnection in the area of frequency in terms of coherence and difference of phases. The collected graphs of the spectral density signal that there are significant tree rings growth gain and average temperature changes during vegetation periods of 40 and 13 years, also 19-22 years and 5-7 years. In taiga geocomplexes of the European North of Russia, radial growth gain of timber is limited exactly by warmth and humidity correlation, in the atmosphere, as well as in the ground, especially during vegetation periods. | ['grippa', 'potakhin'] | ","['grippa', 'potakhin']",0
151,"Pine (Pinus sylvestris) treeline performance in the southern Swedish Scandes since the early 20th century A dynamic phytogeographical perspective based on repeat survey and photography | the context of climate change, this paper accounts for elevational treeline change of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) since the early 20th century at a large number of sites, regionally distributed over the southern Swedish Scan des. The methodological approach draws on re-surveys of original baseline treeline positions since about 1916, reconstructed by dendroecology within belt transects, extended to the present-day treeline. On three subsequent revisitations, viz. 1975, 2005-2007 and 2013-2016, the same transects were assessed with respect to treeline position (m a.s.l.). Supplementary information was obtained by repeat photography, age structure analyses, seed germination tests and ground temperature recordings. This is one of few existing treeline studies based on direct observations over such a long time in a regional context.Since the early-20th century, the pine treeline advanced by average 80 m and maximum 225 m. The latter number implies that the new and raised treeline and possibly the climate shift behind may be uniquely high in the context of the past 7000 years or so, but much higher treelines prevailed prior to that. The average rate of upshift was 0.8 m/year for the entire monitoring period and maximum 1.7 m/year during the interval 1975-2007. The later figure is twice as fast as the rise recorded in a previous study for mountain birch over the same period of time. The present phase of treeline upshift took its start when treelines and temperatures had been declining for millennia to a postglacial nadir in the late 19th century. In addition to climate warming, pine progression during the past 100 years or so, may partly relate to steadily increased reindeer impact, which alleviated the ""lichen barrier effect"" on seed germination, seedling establishment and subsequent growth.Few sites displayed upshifts near the maximum value obtained, i.e. 225 m. Spatially different extent of responses likely relate to topoclimatic idiosyncrasies. A more or less dense mountain birch matrix may locally have prohibited the treeline to reach its potential level under more optimal site conditions.In contrast to the pine treeline, the forest limit of pine has remained virtually stable, although perceivably densified and vitalized, during the past 100 years. Obviously, altitudinal pine forest expansion is prohibited by the more or less dense and competitive subalpine birch forest belt, prevailing above the pine treeline. An anomaly to this pattern is provided in the southernmost Swedish Scandes (province of Dalarna), where sparse pine stands have recently ""leapfrogged"" over the relatively narrow and receding birch forest belt. Possibly, this course of change signals the advent of an entirely new zonation pattern more generally in the Swedish Scandes, with pine eventually forming a new upper forest belt. This option is conditional on permanency of the current warm phase and that the birch forest as a consequence loses its dominant position in response to diminishing supply of snow melt-water during the summer. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],0
152,"Plant phenological records in northern Finland since the 18th century as retrieved from databases, archives and diaries for biometeorological research | Plant phenological data from northern Finland, compiled from several sources, were examined as potential biometeorological indicators of climate change since the 18th century. A common feature of individual series was their sporadic nature. In addition to waning enthusiasm, wartime hardships and crop failures had caused gaps in recording observations during the 18th and 19th centuries. The present study's challenge was to combine separate records, as retrieved from several historical archives and personal diaries, into a single continuous series. To avoid possible biases due to the variability of data availability each year, each phenomenon-specific mean series was transformed into normalized site-specific index series. These series were compared to each other and to a regional instrumental temperature series (years 1802-2011). The inter-phenomena correlations were high. Moreover, a strong biometeorological response of the phenological series, most especially to monthly mean temperature in May, and seasonally to the April through June temperatures, was identified. This response focused on slightly later spring months compared to the responses in an earlier study conducted for southern Finland. The findings encouraged us to compute a total phenological index series as an average of all available phenomenon-specific index series for northern Finland. The earliest phenological springs were found as a cluster in the recent end of the record, whereas the anomalously-late phenological spring could be found through the centuries. This finding could indicate that potential future warming could result in an earlier onset of phenological springs (i.e. as experienced by the plants), with a remaining possibility of late phenological springs. To conclude, it was shown that the indices are reliable biometeorological indicators of the April through June temperature variations and thus of the climate variability in the region. | ['gregow', 'helama', 'holopainen', 'lappalainen'] | ","['gregow', 'helama', 'holopainen', 'lappalainen']",3
153,"Plant response to climate change along the forest-tundra ecotone in northeastern Siberia | Russia's boreal (taiga) biome will likely contract sharply and shift northward in response to 21st century climatic change, yet few studies have examined plant response to climatic variability along the northern margin. We quantified climate dynamics, trends in plant growth, and growth-climate relationships across the tundra shrublands and Cajander larch (Larix cajanderi Mayr.) woodlands of the Kolyma river basin (657000km(2)) in northeastern Siberia using satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), tree ring-width measurements, and climate data. Mean summer temperatures (T-s) increased 1.0 degrees C from 1938 to 2009, though there was no trend (P>0.05) in growing year precipitation or climate moisture index (CMIgy). Mean summer NDVI (NDVIs) increased significantly from 1982 to 2010 across 20% of the watershed, primarily in cold, shrub-dominated areas. NDVIs positively correlated (P<0.05) with T-s across 56% of the watershed (r=0.52 +/- 0.09, mean +/- SD), principally in cold areas, and with CMIgy across 9% of the watershed (r=0.45 +/- 0.06), largely in warm areas. Larch ring-width measurements from nine sites revealed that year-to-year (i.e., high-frequency) variation in growth positively correlated (P<0.05) with June temperature (r=0.40) and prior summer CMI (r=0.40) from 1938 to 2007. An unexplained multi-decadal (i.e., low-frequency) decline in annual basal area increment (BAI) occurred following the mid-20th century, but over the NDVI record there was no trend in mean BAI (P>0.05), which significantly correlated with NDVIs (r=0.44, P<0.05, 1982-2007). Both satellite and tree-ring analyses indicated that plant growth was constrained by both low temperatures and limited moisture availability and, furthermore, that warming enhanced growth. Impacts of future climatic change on forests near treeline in Arctic Russia will likely be influenced by shifts in both temperature and moisture, which implies that projections of future forest distribution and productivity in this area should take into account the interactions of energy and moisture limitations. | ['beck', 'berner', 'bunn', 'goetz'] | ","['beck', 'berner', 'bunn', 'goetz']",3
154,"Plasticity in variation of xylem and phloem cell characteristics of Norway spruce under different local conditions | There is limited information on intra-annual plasticity of secondary tissues of tree species growing under different environmental conditions. To increase the knowledge about the plasticity of secondary growth, which allows trees to adapt to specific local climatic regimes, we examined climate-radial growth relationships of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.] from three contrasting locations in the temperate climatic zone by analyzing tree-ring widths for the period 1932-2010, and cell characteristics in xylem and phloem increments formed in the years 2009-2011. Variation in the structure of xylem and phloem increments clearly shows that plasticity in seasonal dynamics of cambial cell production and cell differentiation exists on xylem and phloem sides. Anatomical characteristics of xylem and phloem cells are predominantly site-specific characteristics, because they varied among sites but were fairly uniform among years in trees from the same site. Xylem and phloem tissues formed in the first part of the growing season seemed to be more stable in structure, indicating their priority over latewood and late phloem for tree performance. Long-term climate and radial growth analyses revealed that growth was in general less dependent on precipitation than on temperature; however, growth sensitivity to local conditions differed among the sites. Only partial dependence of radial growth of spruce on climatic factors on the selected sites confirms its strategy to adapt the structure of wood and phloem increments to function optimally in local conditions. | ['cufar', 'gricar', 'gryc', 'hacurova', 'prislan', 'vavrcik', 'de', 'luis'] | ","['cufar', 'gricar', 'gryc', 'hacurova', 'prislan', 'vavrcik', 'de', 'luis']",0
155,"Poor nutrition as a potential cause of divergent tree growth near the Arctic treeline in northern Alaska | Trees growing near the Arctic treeline have long been used to reconstruct past climates. However, recent studies have shown deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between air temperature and tree growth (known as ""divergence""). Divergence has important implications for confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and ecosystem-atmosphere carbon exchange. Studies in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska showed that white spruce in the west increased growth in response to late 20th century warming, whereas those in the east failed to show a growth increase. In an earlier study across four watersheds in the Brooks Range, we tested and rejected the hypothesis that divergence in the easternmost watershed reflects moisture limitation of growth. Here, using 16 sites distributed across the same four watersheds, we tested an alternative hypothesis, that greater nutrient limitation in the east may have impeded positive growth responses to warming. Climate comparison across the four Brooks Range study watersheds revealed that, although the easternmost watershed generally had a drier growing-season climate, the most consistent difference was that winter air temperature and both winter and summer soil temperatures were much colder in the central and eastern watersheds. Soil nutrient availability, foliar nutrient concentrations, and tree growth were all generally lower in the central and eastern than in the western watersheds. Foliar phosphorus concentration was the best predictor of spatial variation in branch extension growth-a finding that is somewhat inconsistent with the theory that forest productivity on young, glacially derived soils should be strongly nitrogen limited. Experimental fertilization yielded the greatest growth increase in the eastern, an intermediate response in the central, and the smallest growth increase in the western watershed, generally mirroring trends in soil temperature, soil nutrient availability, foliar nutrient concentrations, and growth of control trees. Our results confirm that growth in the easternmost watershed is more nutrient limited and suggest that phosphorus limitation may be at least as important as nitrogen limitation of growth. We hypothesize that cold soil effects on tree access to nutrients might explain divergence in the eastern Brooks Range and elsewhere near the Arctic treeline, particularly in areas with cold winters and widespread permafrost. | ['cahoon', 'ellison', 'hewitt', 'sullivan'] | ","['cahoon', 'ellison', 'hewitt', 'sullivan']",4
156,"Postglacial vegetation and climate | The past climate and vegetation of the Mackenzie valley has been reconstructed for the past 13 000 radiocarbon years using fossil-pollen records and studies of tree rings. The earliest vegetation cover in much of the valley was sparse and dominated by small shrubs and herbs. It is possible that aspen and/or poplar trees were also present. By about 10 000 BP birch tundra was dominant throughout the valley. Between 10 000 and 9000 forests of white and black spruce were established as far north as the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula. The forest retreated slightly in the Mackenzie Delta region and in the mountains after 5000 years ago. Tree-ring records show that the during portions of the nineteenth century, summer temperatures in the valley were perhaps 1 to 2¬∞C colder than they are today. In the twentieth century there has been some increased establishment of spruce at higher elevations in the mountains. | ['macdonald'] | ",['macdonald'],3

158,"Proxy-based 300-year High Arctic climate warming record from Svalbard | We used fossil Chironomidae assemblages and the transfer function approach to reconstruct summer air temperatures over the past 300 years from a High Arctic lake in Hornsund, Svalbard. Our aims were to compare reconstructed summer temperatures with observed (last 100 years) seasonal temperatures, to determine a potential climate warming break point in the temperature series and to assess the significance and rate of the climate warming trend at the study site. The reconstructed temperatures were consistent with a previous proxy record from Svalbard and showed good correlation with the meteorological observations from Bjornoya and Longyearbyen. From the current palaeoclimate record, we found a significant climate warming threshold in the 1930s, after which the temperatures rapidly increased. We also found that the climate warming trend was strong and statistically significant. Compared with the reconstructed Little Ice Age temperatures in late eighteenth century cooling culmination, the present day summer temperatures are >4 degrees C higher and the temperature increase since the 1930s has been 0.5 degrees C per decade. These results highlight the exceptionally rapid recent warming of southern Svalbard and add invaluable information on the seasonality of High Arctic climate change and Arctic amplification. | ['luoto', 'ojala', 'zajaczkowski'] | ","['luoto', 'ojala', 'zajaczkowski']",2
159,"Proxy data reconstructions of the Storglaciaren (Sweden) mass-balance record back to AD 1500 on annual to decadal timescales | Regional summer temperatures (T-S), derived from tree rings, and large-scale atmospheric circulation indices (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)) were used to infer the mass balance of Storglaciaren, Sweden, on annual and decadal timescales back to AD 1500. Winter (January-March) NAO was not a suitable proxy for interannual winter balance variability, but seemed to have substantial influence on decadal timescales. T-S were highly correlated to the summer balance, but also to the annual net balance. This association was much weaker on decadal timescales, mainly because of the increased maritime climate around 1980. Storglaciaren net balance was modelled back to AD 1500 with annual resolution (using T-S as a predictor), and AD 1664 with decadal resolution (using T-S and NAO as predictors). Both reconstructions displayed similar evolution. Negative mass balances dominated most of the 16th century, followed by a longer period of predominantly positive mass-balance years culminating in about 1750. This is in agreement with previous suggestions of Holocene maximum expansion of Storglaciaren at that time. Subsequently, the mass balance is highly variable, with an increased number of negative years. The build-up to the well-documented early-20th-century advance is evident as mass balance becomes progressively more positive towards the early 20th century. | ['jansson', 'linderholm'] | ","['jansson', 'linderholm']",1
160,"Quasi-periodic climate teleconnections between northern and southern Europe during the 17th-20th centuries | The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region, influencing storm tracks and creating a dipole pattern of precipitation from north to south across Western Europe. This distinct spatial distribution of precipitation provides a framework that can be potentially used to identify and reconstruct patterns of past NAO-forced climate variability. In this study we use tree-ring width series from Western Europe, in conjunction with principal components analysis and advanced spectral methods, to prospect for quasi-periodic climate signals that are forced by the NAO. We identify a robust 25-yr anti-phased synchronization in climate variability between Scandinavia and the Mediterranean during the 17th-20th centuries. The amplitude of the 25-yr beat displays a long-term modulation in northern and southern Europe, with minimum amplitude during the late Maunder Minimum. This amplitude minimum coincides with a maximum in Œî14C, suggesting a potential solar or oceanic influence on the intensity of the 25-yr band of quasi-periodic variability. ¬© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

161,"Radial growth of Picea glauca and Picea engelmannii across Canada and USA: monthly climate, decadal oscillations, and climate change | We employ a dendrochronological approach to examine spatial variation in radial tree growth-climate relationships and responses to global climate oscillations across the geographic ranges of Picea glauca and Picea engelmannii. Tree-ring chronologies were constructed for 77 sites and analyzed using correlation coefficients for monthly climatic variables. In general, for Picea glauca, stands in the western portion of its range had significant negative correlations with temperature during fall, winter, and spring; only summer temperature was positively correlated with tree growth. In eastern North America, Picea glauca growth was negatively correlated with winter and spring temperature. Across the north-south range of Picea engelmannii, growth of northern populations was positively correlated with temperature in most seasons except spring, which had negative correlations, and response to winter precipitation differed between northern and southern populations. However, some monthly values for both species correlations were altered due to decadal oscillation phase, especially for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. | ['billah', 'goldblum'] | ","['billah', 'goldblum']",2
162,"Radial increment of Scots Pine in the Pinetum sphagnosum in relation to secular solar cycles | In continued research [cf. FA 35, 7812], studies were made on 26 sample trees in the Komi ASSR and a ring chronology was established for the period 1480-1970. The increment indices were compared with relative Wolf numbers for solar activity over the period, and five secular cycles having an average period of 81 years were identified. Periods of increased increment of the Pine coincided with periods of increased solar activity. It is suggested that a main reason for secular fluctuations of increment in boggy Pine forest types is a cyclic change in the hydrological regime of the soils following secular fluctuations of climate. During periods with predominantly meridional atmospheric circulation, wetter growing seasons and reduced stand increment are observed. On the Russian plain, such periods occurred in 1585-1610, 1660-1687, 1722-1750, and 1800-1830. A decline in secular solar activity started after 1958 and accordingly it is suggested that in the next 10-20 years a reduction in increment of boggy Pine forest types can be expected in the central taiga subzone of the Pre-Urals region. | ['olenin'] | ",['olenin'],2

Pine reached its maximum distribution during the postglacial climatic optimum, when the outermost occurrences were far beyond its present limit.

167,"Recent temperature extremes at high northern latitudes unprecedented in the past 600 years | Recently observed extreme temperatures at high northern latitudes(1-7) are rare by definition, making the longer time span afforded by climate proxies important for assessing how the frequency of such extremes may be changing. Previous reconstructions of past temperature variability have demonstrated that recent warmth is anomalous relative to preceding centuries(2,8,9) or millennia(10), but extreme events can be more thoroughly evaluated using a spatially resolved approach that provides an ensemble of possible temperature histories(11,12). Here, using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis(13,14) of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600 years. The summers of 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011 were warmer than those of all prior years back to 1400 (probability P > 0.95), in terms of the spatial average. The summer of 2010 was the warmest in the previous 600 years in western Russia (P > 0.99) and probably the warmest in western Greenland and the Canadian Arctic as well (P > 0.90). These and other recent extremes greatly exceed those expected from a stationary climate, but can be understood as resulting from constant space-time variability about an increased mean temperature. | ['huybers', 'tingley'] | ","['huybers', 'tingley']",0
168,"Recent Tree-Limit History of Picea-Abies in the Southern Swedish Scandes | The recent history of Picea abies (L.) Karst. at its altitudinal tree limit has been studied in the southern Swedish Scandes. Altitudinal transects (131) were evenly distributed over a tract of mountains of ca. 40 .times. 200 km. The age of spruces growing at the tree limit and downhill were estimated by annual ring counts. The spruce tree limit had risen (on average by ca. 50 m altitudinally) in ca. 70% of the studied transects as a result of the subsequent growth in height of old, established, formerly stunted individuals. Their growth in height accelerated during the 1930's, in response to the general climatic warming. A rise in the tree limit because of the establishment of new individuals (after 1915) was noted in only 7% of the studied transects. Most of the spruces growing in the tree-limit ecotone established around the 1860's, and the 1940's, which were epochs with relatively snowy winters. After 1860, spruce establishment was not correlated with the summer mean temperature. Successful regeneration of spruce at the tree limit is dependent of a deep and stable snow cover and the requisite balance between precipitation-meltwater and evaporation being maintained in the early summer. The importance of air temperatures in May for successful growth and natural regeneration was evident. High air temperature in May is detrimental, since it promotes a too early initiation of growth and a consequent increased risk of frost damage. The spruce populations at the tree limit are recruited both from local seed parents and from long distance dispersal of seed from trees growing at lower altitudes. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],0

171,"Reconstruction of seasonal temperatures in Central Canada since A.D. 1700 and detection of the 18.6- and 22-year signals | This paper presents an attempt to summarize various sparse proxy series into continuous and exhaustive climatic data. Freeze-up and break-up dates, early meteorological records and tree-ring data have been combined for the Hudson Bay region and 22 continuous proxy series extending from 1700 to 1979 have been deduced. These new series in term provided the basis for a regressive reconstruction of six seasonal temperature series. Verification tests are successful mainly for the high frequencies components. The low frequencies variability is better estimated by a best analogues method. Both kinds of reconstructions have been combined to improve the results. The main characteristic of the reconstructions is a warming trend beginning at the end of the 19th century. Evidence for a beat wave resulting from 22-year solar and 18.6-year lunar nodal tidal cycles is presented. A phase analysis showed results consistent with other studies of summer temperature variability: temperature maxima correspond to sunspot minima ending an even cycle and are emphasized by the lunar maxima. Different phenomena are pointed out for autumn and winter temperatures: their maxima coincide to sunspot even maxima amplified by lunar minima. In spring, the transition season, these signals are not apparent. ¬© 1987 D. Reidel Publishing Company. | ['guiot'] | ",['guiot'],2
172,"Reconstruction of short vegetation Seasons at the north of western Siberia on chronology of circannual rings | Cores of larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.) and spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) were collected on three sites in Western Siberia along the Ob river (65¬∞15' N 65¬∞29' E - 66¬∞38' N 66¬∞20' E) to reveal light rings with purpose (1) to learn possible reasons to light ring formation along the Ob river and (2) to reconstruct extreme climatic events. In the study area the light-ring formation is connected with unusual low temperature of May, June, August, but conditions of light-ring formation are different between species and sites. The period 1880-2000 has 4 years with light rings in coniferous wood at all three sites. Larch light-ring chronologies have 11 common years and spruce chronologies have 5 years. Results of a multiple linear stepwise regression showed that May and June temperatures explain 20-30% of light ring variance in spruce, and May, June and August temperatures explain 30-36% of light ring variance in larch.

173,"Reconstruction of subarctic lake levees over past centuries using tree rings | This paper presents the dendrochronological markers used to date the erosive activity of ice and waves on the shores of two large lakes in Northern Quebec. Damages to trees are dated by detailed analysis of anomalous tree rings in response to the shore geomorphic activity associated with extreme water levels over the last 2 centuries. Spring floods are dated using ice scars on trees and shrubs. Lake ice breakup occurs 4-6 weeks after snowmelt. Marks on trees made by ice displaced by the wind indicate the flood levels. Once ice breakup is complete, waves erode forest edges. Tree tilting, dated by counting rings in compression wood, mark high lake levels at the beginning of summer. At submerged sites that are not subject to waves and ice, stress related to prolonged submersion results in narrow tree rings. Trees located in the immersion rone show narrow rings compared to wider rings in unsubmerged trees. However. tree response is not immediate; they can primarily respond to sequences of several consecutive years of stress, reducing the resolution of dating to 2-3 years. Rings of submerged trees are denser than average. These high water level markers, as well as population recruitment showed by the age structure of shoreline trees and shrubs, which establish during intercalary years of low water levels, were used to date the extreme levels of two large lakes at the interface between the upper boreal and subarctic regions in northeastern Canada. During the past 200 years, the annual extreme levels have been increasing, becoming even more pronounced in the 1930s, and may be due to a century-long increase in snow precipitation. The summers seem to be drier. The 1930s, 1950s, and 1970s were marked by a high frequency of high water levels. Intercalary periods of low water levels allowed regeneration of shoreline forests and recovery of trees damaged during these events. It appears that episodes similar to the recent period of low waters experienced in the American northeast since 1982 may have occurred in the past during the 1920s, 1940s, and 1960s. | ['begin'] | ",['begin'],3
174,"Reconstruction of summer Palmer Drought Severity Index from delta C-13 of larch tree rings in East Siberia | We present a dendroclimatic reconstruction of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) in Yakutsk (62 degrees 14'N, 129 degrees 37'E), East Siberia using a larch tree-ring (latewood) delta C-13 chronology (1780-2008 AD). The correlation function analysis showed significant positive correlations between earlywood, latewood and total ring width and July PDSI of the previous summer. On the other hand, tree-ring delta C-13 from earlywood, latewood and total ring showed significant negative correlations with July PDSI in current summer, of which latewood delta C-13 showed highest correlation with PDSI. A moving-window correlation analysis demonstrated that the temporal stability in correlation between tree-ring variables and PDSI was highest when July PDSI was compared with latewood delta C-13. Tree-ring delta C-13 values were corrected by taking account of both the changes in the isotope ratio of atmospheric CO2 (delta C-13(a)) and the plant physiological response to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a). This correction significantly improved the sensitivity of larch tree-ring delta C-13 to PDSI, demonstrating that the correction is useful in building a reliable model to estimate past changes in PDSI. Our study shows that larch tree-ring delta C-13 has enough potential to reconstruct July PDSI series. Using a liner regression model, July PDSI was reconstructed from latewood delta C-13 over the last 229 years. The reconstruction showed an interannual to decadal wet/dry fluctuation with a decreasing trend from 1780 to 1960, suggesting that aridification progressed at least after the late Little Ice Age in East Siberia to the modern period of global warming.

All but one of the standard and residual chronologies exhibited significant positive correlations with June precipitation in the growth year, and all but three of the chronologies exhibited positive correlations with precipitation in June, July, or August of the previous year. Three of the residual chronologies also exhibited negative correlations with June temperature in the growth year. Four of the standard and residual chronologies exhibited significant correlations with the Seasonal Severity Rating fire weather variable from Fort Smith, N.W.T. Four of the standard chronologies and three of the residual chronologies exhibited significant correlations with the annual area burned in Wood Buffalo National Park. Significant correlations were also found for some of the standard and residual chronologies with fire weather and annual area burned in the previous year. These results suggest that ring widths and annual area burned in this portion of the boreal forest are sensitive to similar weather conditions. Tree-ring records may therefore provide a useful means of examining decadal to centennial length relations between climate and annual area burned in the boreal forest. | ['larsen', 'macdonald'] | ","['larsen', 'macdonald']",3
181,"Relationship of temperature and light ring formation at subarctic treeline and implications for climate reconstruction | During the past 8 centuries, light rings (LRs) have occasionally formed in black spruce (Picea mariana) at treeline near Bush Lake, northern Quebec (Canada) (L. Filion, S. Payette, L. Gauthier, and Y. Boutin, 1986, Quaternary Research 26, 272-279; A. Delwaide, L. Filion, and S. Payette, 1991, Canadian Journal of Forest Research 21, 1828-1832). New analyses of climate data compiled during the period of overlapping tree-ring and instrumental records show that years of LR formation at Bush Lake have unusually cool May, June, August, and September temperatures. The analyses also show that August-September temperatures strongly correlate with May-July temperatures. Thus, late spring and entire growing-season temperatures influence LR formation at subarctic tree-line. LRs formed in at least 5% of the trees at Bush Lake when May-September mean temperatures at Inukjuak fell below 4.2 degree C and August-September mean temperatures fell below 6.7 degree C. These threshold temperature/LR relationships can be used to infer limiting summer temperatures during the period preceding instrumental records. For example, the LR record suggests that May-September temperatures at northern Quebec treeline dropped below 4.2 degree C in A.D. 1601 after a major volcanic eruption of unknown source. Visual assessments of LR occurrence provide a new approach for extracting quantitative paleoclimatic information from tree rings. | ['filion', 'savage', 'yamaguchi'] | ","['filion', 'savage', 'yamaguchi']",3

To extend this mass-balance record, we have reconstructed summer (bS) and winter (bW) mass balances separately back to the mass balance year 1780/81 with annual resolution. We used tree-ring data for bS and a set of circulation indices, based on the sea-level pressure, for bW. Both proxies have correlation coefficients with respective mass balance components of ca. 0.7. The reconstructed net balance (bN) of Storglaci√§ren was well correlated to the observations during 1946-1980 (r = 0.8, p &lt; 0.05). Our reconstruction agrees well with previously obtained results of northern Sweden glacier variability, where the predominantly positive bN years between 1890 and 1910 correspond to the well documented post-Little Ice Age advance of Storglaci√§ren. Furthermore, the results suggest that bS, as a function of summer temperatures, is more important than bW in determining the bN, which is contrary to glaciers in the maritime parts of western Scandinavia. In general, bN has been negative over the last 220 yr, suggesting a predomination of continental conditions over northern Sweden. However, the influence of bW increased in the late twentieth century, indicating a shift to a more oceanic climate regime. ¬© 2006 University of Washington. | ['chen', 'jansson', 'linderholm'] | ","['chen', 'jansson', 'linderholm']",2
183,"Response of central Siberian Scots pine to soil water deficit and long-term trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration | [1] Twenty tree ring C-13/C-12 ratio chronologies from Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) trees were determined from five locations sampled along the Yenisei River, spaced over a total distance of similar to1000 km between the cities of Turuhansk (66degreesN) and Krasnoyarsk (56degreesN). The transect covered the major part of the natural distribution of Scots pine in the region with median growing season temperatures and precipitation varying from 12.2degreesC and 218 mm to 14.0degreesC and 278 mm for Turuhansk and Krasnoyarsk, respectively. A key focus of the study was to investigate the effects of variations in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentration on long-and short-term variation in photosynthetic C-13 discrimination during photosynthesis and the marginal cost of tree water use, as reflected in the differences in the historical records of the C-13/C-12 ratio in wood cellulose compared to that of the atmosphere (Delta(13)C(c)). In 17 of the 20 samples, trees Delta(13)C(c) has declined during the last 150 years, particularly so during the second half of the twentieth century. Using a model of stomatal behaviour combined with a process-based photosynthesis model, we deduce that this trend indicates a long-term decrease in canopy stomatal conductance, probably in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This response being observed for most trees along the transect is suggestive of widespread decreases in Delta(13)C(c) and increased water use efficiency for Scots pine in central Siberia over the last century. Overlying short-term variations in Delta(13)C(c) were also accounted for by the model and were related to variations in growing season soil water deficit and atmospheric humidity. | ['arneth', 'bird', 'gleixner', 'grigoryev', 'kalaschnikov', 'lloyd', 'santruckova', 'schulze'] | ","['arneth', 'bird', 'gleixner', 'grigoryev', 'kalaschnikov', 'lloyd', 'santruckova', 'schulze']",0

185,"Response of Old-Growth Montane Picea-Abies L. Karst. Forest to Climatic Variability in Northern Sweden | Repeat photography and tree ring analyses were used to investigate structural change, 1938-88, of an old growth and high elevation Picea abies (L.) Karst. forest in northern Sweden. The forest, initially moribund, senescent and top-broken, regenerated broken tops and apparently gained in vigour. Up to the 1930s this progressive change was pre-dated by an increase of annual increment growth, which subsequently declined until the 1980s. The tree-ring response concurs with the general course of summer temperature while canopy processes appear to lag behind. The study stresses the importance of phenotypic plasticity for long-term behaviour of marginal spruce forest. It is also evident that canopy development is not a fully predictable ageing process, but to some extent dependent on climatic variability. | ['alexandersson', 'hofgaard', 'kullman'] | ","['alexandersson', 'hofgaard', 'kullman']",2

Latewood density, annual ring width and earlywood width respond more strongly to climate than latewood width or earlywood density. Earlywood width is controlled by precipitation in June and temperatures in mid winter (December/January) and March. Low mean temperature in April, adequate precipitation in May and a warm July results in wide rings. A long and warm vegetation period results in high latewood density, the strongest correlations occurring with July and August temperature and precipitation. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Chronologies of mean annual stem elongation, leaf production, and flower production were developed, and estimates of these parameters agree with those obtained for other arctic populations of C. tetragona. Stem elongation and leaf production were positively correlated in the same year. Flower production was positively correlated with growth in the previous year, but negatively correlated with growth in the same year. This pattern was interpreted as the effects of resource allocation strategies, namely, the preemption of within-plant resources by flower production once flowering is initiated. All chronologies were significantly correlated with climate records from Alexandra Fiord and Eureka, Ellesmere Island, with the majority of significant correlations occurring with June and July temperatures. Flower production appeared to be most sensitive to variations in summer temperatures, and climate response functions which included previous growth explained up to 84% of the variation in the flowering chronology. Unstandardized leaf and flower number chronologies were used to provide an independent test of the climate transfer function presented in Havstrom et al. (1995). The results indicate that C. tetragona may be used successfully to generate proxy climate data, although use of standardized chronologies is recommended. Two predictive models for July temperatures at Alexandra Fiord, based on standardized chronologies, are presented to provide future opportunities for verification and application of this technique. | ['henry', 'johnstone'] | ","['henry', 'johnstone']",2
188,"A 930-year ring-width chronology from moisture-sensitive white spruce (Picea glauca Moench) in northwestern Canada | A 930-year tree-ring chronology was constructed from living and subfossil white spruce (Picea glauca Moench) from the Campbell Dolomite Upland, Northwest Territories, Canada. Response function analysis using climate data from nearby Inuvik indicates that 69% of the variation in ring widths can be explained by monthly precipitation and temperature. Ring width is most strongly correlated with high precipitation between February and May. There is also a significant negative relationship between ring widths and temperatures during the previous growing season. Periods of slow radial growth at Ao 1820-1855, 1700-1710, 1585-1610, 1395-1405, 1260-1300 and 1125-1170 are assumed to be associated with times of increased moisture stress. Periods of rapid growth at AD 1925-1940, 1770-1780, 1725-1740, 1510-1560, 1215-1260 and 1185-1205 likely reflect higher precipitation and/or decreased moisture stress. This chronology is the oldest yet published from northwestern Canada and the first that provides a dendrohydrological record. | ['macdonald', 'szeicz'] | ","['macdonald', 'szeicz']",2
189,"Rise and demise of cold-climate Picea abies forest in Sweden | The study focuses on structural and compositional dynamics of high-elevation (boreal) mixed Picea-Betula forest in the Swedish Scandes. Data from seven years' monitoring of crown condition (defoliation), seed viability, soil and air temperatures, a tree-ring chronology and the age structure of Picea are presented. Real long-term dynamism of the tree cover was inferred from radiocarbon dates of buried subfossil wood. At all time-scales, the forest has responded sensitively to thermal variability. Picea seed viability, demography and radial growth correlated positively with summer temperature. The current Picea population largely results from warming during the first half of the 20th century. However, cooler climate in the past c. five decades has led to reduced population and radial growth as well as accelerating crown defoliation. This decline is related primarily to winter soil temperatures. The mechanism of needle loss is deduced to be winter desiccation and resulting cavitation of the xylem. It is hypothesized that previous similar episodes have been balanced by periods of spruce expansion. The successional history leading up to the present stage includes fire disturbance and subsequent cooling during the Little Ice Age, which prolonged and consolidated the early post-fire Betula phase. Pinus was incapable of penetrating these unusually dense birch stands, whereas the shade-intolerant spruce could establish progressively as climate warmed. This course of structural and compositional dynamism relates to complex interactions of disturbance, climate change and reproductive responses. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],2
190,"Russian Arctic warming and 'greening' are closely tracked by tundra shrub willows | Growth in arctic vegetation is generally expected to increase under a warming climate, particularly among deciduous shrubs. We analyzed annual ring growth for an abundant and nearly circumpolar erect willow (Salix lanata L.) from the coastal zone of the northwest Russian Arctic (Nenets Autonomous Okrug). The resulting chronology is strongly related to summer temperature for the period 1942-2005. Remarkably high correlations occur at long distances (> 1600 km) across the tundra and taiga zones of West Siberia and Eastern Europe. We also found a clear relationship with photosynthetic activity for upland vegetation at a regional scale for the period 1981-2005, confirming a parallel 'greening' trend reported for similarly warming North American portions of the tundra biome. The standardized growth curve suggests a significant increase in shrub willow growth over the last six decades. These findings are in line with field and remote sensing studies that have assigned a strong shrub component to the reported greening signal since the early 1980s. Furthermore, the growth trend agrees with qualitative observations by nomadic Nenets reindeer herders of recent increases in willow size in the region. The quality of the chronology as a climate proxy is exceptional. Given its wide geographic distribution and the ready preservation of wood in permafrost, S. lanata L. has great potential for extended temperature reconstructions in remote areas across the Arctic. | ['fauria', 'forbes', 'zetterberg'] | ","['fauria', 'forbes', 'zetterberg']",3
191,"Salix arctica (Pall.): its potential for dendroclimatological studies in the high arctic | Salix arctica, is one of the most northerly occurring plants. A 40-year climate record was available for northern Ellesmere Island (82 degrees 50'N 78 degrees W) in the high Arctic and 30- to 60-year-old samples of arctic willow from this area were evaluated for their potential for dendroclimatological reconstructions. Nine of the 11 samples could be partially cross-dated but growth was very slow (0.07 mm/year). Missing rings in older wood were common. To minimize missing rings and facilitate ring width measurement chronologies must be developed using sections from the entire stem length. Frost rings and establishment years were also promising sources of weather information. Four specimens became established in the mid-1950s, a period of warm summers, and four in the mid-1930s, suggesting that similar conditions prevailed at that time. | ['bradley', 'woodcock'] | ","['bradley', 'woodcock']",3
192,"Past changes in the Scots pine forest line and climate in Finnish Lapland: a study based on megafossils, lake sediments, and GIS-based vegetation and climate data | Subfossil samples of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and evidence of pine stomata and pollen accumulation rates from previously studied lakes located beyond the present pine forest line in Finnish Lapland were used to reconstruct the extent of the past forest line and the corresponding minimum shift in mean July temperatures, compared with the present. The location of the present pine forest line follows the c. +12.2 degrees C mean July temperature isoline (1961-1990). When minimum shifts in mean July temperatures during the Holocene were studied, the estimated glacio-isostatic land uplift and its regional differences were taken into account. Results indicate that pine reached its maximum distribution between 8300 and 4000 cal. yr BP. The inferred minimum shift in mean July temperature was at that time c. +2.5 degrees C. Until 3000 cal. yr BP, the results indicate a shift of c. +1 degrees C. Between 2538 and 1721 cal. yr BP, evidence for a wider distribution of pine in Finnish Lapland is lacking. During the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' the reconstructed minimum shift in mean July temperature was +0.5 degrees C. The record of subfossil pines beyond the present pine treeline ceases during the initiation of the 'Little Ice Age', c. 700 years ago. | ['eronen', 'kultti', 'mikkola', 'timonen', 'virtanen'] | ","['eronen', 'kultti', 'mikkola', 'timonen', 'virtanen']",0
193,"Scots pine growth trends in Northwestern Kola Peninsula as an indicator of positive changes in the carbon cycle | Growth trends of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) at its northernmost extent may be an indicator of changes in the carbon cycle of terrestrial forest ecosystems. Using a method which removed age trends from the data, a time-series analysis of annual radial increment in wood over the last few decades compared with the period of the last registered warming (maximum around 1930-40), revealed elevated growth of 78% for trees 0-20 years old, 56% for trees 21-40 years old, 21% for trees 41-60 years old, and 10% for trees more than 101 years old. Increments of trees in the 61-80 and 81-100 years old age classes from the two periods were similar. The higher rate of growth in recent times occurred despite a decrease in temperature after about 1940 and significant air pollution. During the last century growth of Scots pine increased for trees in all age groups, except for trees in the 81-100 year old age class for which it was constant. The average rates of growth were estimated at 0.016 mm/year for trees in the 0-20 year age class, 0.012 mm/year for the 21-40 year age class, 0.005 mm/year for the 41-60 year age class, 0.008 mm/year for the 61-80 year age class and 0.006 mm/year for trees in the greater than 101 year age class. The growth trends were unstable over time and took place concurrent with increasing oscillations in radial increment. The most probable reasons for the marked increase in radial increment growth of Scots pine in this region are climate warming and higher levels of carbon dioxide. Together these may produce a synergistic effect on growth. | ['alekseev', 'soroka'] | ","['alekseev', 'soroka']",0

The samples were discussed in relation to the present-day tree-limit of pine. Pine reached almost 200 m higher than at present shortly after deglaciation and remained at very high altitudes and at least 4,000-3,500 14C years B.P. The conclusion was that the precise biological and climatological interpretation of these regionally sampled data is still obscure. It is impossible to judge whether clusters of megafossil pine represent periods relatively favourable for pine growth and reproduction or merely periods advantages for production of dead wood and its long-term preservation. In terms of climate, these alternatives reasonably implicate widely different conditions. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],2
197,"Shrubs tracing sea surface temperature-Calluna vulgaris on the Faroe Islands | The climate of Central and Northern Europe is highly influenced by the North Atlantic Ocean due to heat transfer from lower latitudes. Detailed knowledge about spatio-temporal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) in that region is thus of high interest for climate and environmental research. Because of the close relations between ocean and coastal climate and the climate sensitivity of plant growth, annual rings of woody plants in coastal regions might be used as a proxy for SST. We show here for the first time the proxy potential of the common and widespread evergreen dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris (heather), using the Faroe Islands as our case study. Despite its small and irregular ring structure, the species seems suitable for dendroecological investigations. Ring width showed high and significant correlations with summer and winter air temperatures and SST. The C. vulgaris chronology from the Faroe Islands, placed directly within the North Atlantic Current, clearly reflects variations in summer SSTs over an area between Iceland and Scotland. Utilising shrubs like C. vulgaris as easy accessible and annually resolved proxies offers an interesting possibility for reconstruction of the coupled climate-ocean system at high latitudes. | ['beil', 'bura', 'hallinger', 'smiljanic', 'wilmking'] | ","['beil', 'bura', 'hallinger', 'smiljanic', 'wilmking']",3

199,"Spatial climate-dependent growth response of boreal mixedwood forest in western Canada | The western Canadian mixedwood boreal forests were projected to be significantly affected by regional drought. However, drought degrees were spatially different across elevations, longitudes and latitudes, which might cause different tree growth responses to climate change in different sub-regions within western Canada. In this way, regional classification of western Canadian boreal forests and understanding spatial tree growth responses to climate might be necessary for future forest management and monitoring. In this paper, tree-ring chronologies of two dominant tree species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss), were obtained from mixed forest stands distributed across western Canada to study spatial tree growth response to climate based on three regional classification schemes (a phytogeographic sub-region classification, a natural sub-region classification and non-classification). Phytogeographic sub-region classification was estimated based on tree ring samples we collected in this study, while natural sub-region classification was previously developed based on analysis of regional differences in vegetation, soil, site and climate conditions. Results showed that air temperature did not significantly increase, while drought stress became more severe between 1985 to 2010. Relationships between trembling aspen growth and temperature differed between north and south parts of the study area, resulting from spatial difference in water supply. Trembling aspen growth was influenced by temperature or moisture variables of the previous years. White spruce growth was influenced primarily by moisture variables (current or previous year), and response coefficients between white spruce and drought conditions (represented by drought code) were negative in all phytogeographic sub-regions, suggesting that white spruce was more sensitive to drought stress under climate change. As a late-successional dominant species, increasingly drought stress on white spruce might cause significant alteration in forest composition of western Canadian boreal forest. | ['chen', 'comeau', 'huang', 'jiang', 'stadt'] | ","['chen', 'comeau', 'huang', 'jiang', 'stadt']",0

Boreas, Vol. 37, pp. 000-000. 10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00046.x. ISSN 0300-9483.The spatial and temporal stability of the climatic signal in pine tree-ring width and maximum density is examined using data from four sites in northern Sweden and Finland. Moving-window multiple linear regression, using monthly and daily climate data, indicates that ring widths at all sites have been strongly controlled by July temperatures throughout the past century. The relationship between maximum density and temperature is stronger but much less stable across both space and time. Shifts in the hottest part of the summer do not explain large shifts in the period most strongly influencing density. It is concluded that palaeoclimate reconstructions based on northern Fennoscandian pine tree-ring width chronologies should be restricted to the temperature of midsummer (July), whereas maximum density should be used to reconstruct the temperature of a longer growth season (June to August). They thus provide different and complementary palaeoclimate signals. At all four sites, the correlation between maximum density and June to August mean temperature is lowest in the latter half of the 20th century, but split sample tests with strong verification statistics (RE and CE) show that this represents a quantitative change in the strength of the correlation with climate, rather than a qualitative change in the nature of that relationship, and thus does not invalidate climate reconstructions. | ['grudd', 'jalkanen', 'los', 'mccarroll', 'tuovinen'] | ","['grudd', 'jalkanen', 'los', 'mccarroll', 'tuovinen']",2
201,"Spatial and temporal variability in dendroclimatic growth response of red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) to climate in northern Ontario, Canada | Growth-climate relationships of trees are species-specific and can vary over space and time. Here, we study red pine (Pinus resinosa Alt.) by analyzing tree-ring width data from 37 sites across northern Ontario, Canada for the period 1901-2010. We performed response function and moving response function analyses using seasonal data of three climatic variables: precipitation, minimum temperature and maximum temperature. Our analyses show considerable spatial and temporal variability in red pine growth response to climate during the 20th century. In general, red pine growth responses to climate were more significant in northwestern Ontario than in northeastern Ontario. Overall, precipitation was the most significant predictor of red pine growth, with seasonal variations across sites. Unlike many other studies, we did not find any significant growth response to current year summer temperature. Instead, at many sites in northwestern Ontario, red pine had a significant negative growth response to prior summer temperatures. The results of canonical correspondence analysis show that red pine growth response to climate follows a longitudinal gradient. Temporal stability analyses revealed that growth-climate response of red pine at any site was not stable during the 20th century. We observed a general shift from significant growth response to seasonal temperature during the first half of the 20th century to significant growth response to seasonal (except for spring) precipitation during recent decades. The spatial and temporal variability of red pine growth response to climate detected in our study should be considered in future plans for forest management of this species and can also be used for better understanding forest ecological dynamics at the regional scale for conservation purposes.

202,"Spatial variation of Pine Tree-Ring Growth in the Solovetsky Islands | The paper presents the results of an analysis of the spatial variability of pine tree-ring growth in the Solovetsky Islands. As a result of the field work, tree-ring network containing 14 dendrochronological pine sites in various habitats were developed. For each site, a local tree-ring width pine chronology (from 472 to 271 years) is obtained, representing pine growth features in different habitat conditions. A comparison between chronologies revealed synchronious growth of pine in various habitats in the late 17th, in the first half of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries. The use of cluster analysis allowed to identify several groups of chronologies with similar characteristics. So, trees growing on swamps, on a sandy substrate and in a green-moss pine forest or in a mixed forest are allocated in separate clusters. This clustering is also confirmed by the results of a dendroclimatic analysis of local chronologies. It turned out that the increase in the pine's growth in the mixed forest and in the green-moss pine forest depends on the July air temperature variation. Inside this group, samples from pine forests have a common feature - a positive relationship of growth with the precipitation of September. The only site located on the sands showed a different climatic signal than the other chronologies, namely, the dependence on the temperature of August. ¬© 2019 Russian Academy of Sciences.

203,"Spatio-temporal patterns of tree growth as related to carbon isotope fractionation in European forests under changing climate | Aim The aim was to decipher Europe-wide spatio-temporal patterns of forest growth dynamics and their associations with carbon isotope fractionation processes inferred from tree rings as modulated by climate warming. Location Europe and North Africa (30-70 degrees N, 10 degrees W-35 degrees E). Time period 1901-2003. Major taxa studied Temperate and Euro-Siberian trees. Methods We characterize changes in the relationship between tree growth and carbon isotope fractionation over the 20th century using a European network consisting of 20 site chronologies. Using indexed tree-ring widths (TRWi), we assess shifts in the temporal coherence of radial growth across sites (synchrony) for five forest ecosystems (Atlantic, boreal, cold continental, Mediterranean and temperate). We also examine whether TRWi shows variable coupling with leaf-level gas exchange, inferred from indexed carbon isotope discrimination of tree-ring cellulose (Delta C-13(i)). Results We find spatial autocorrelation for TRWi and Delta C-13(i) extending over a maximum of 1,000 km among forest stands. However, growth synchrony is not uniform across Europe, but increases along a latitudinal gradient concurrent with decreasing temperature and evapotranspiration. Latitudinal relationships between TRWi and Delta C-13(i) (changing from negative to positive southwards) point to drought impairing carbon uptake via stomatal regulation for water saving occurring at forests below 60 degrees N in continental Europe. An increase in forest growth synchrony over the 20th century together with increasingly positive relationships between TRWi and Delta C-13(i) indicate intensifying impacts of drought on tree performance. These effects are noticeable in drought-prone biomes (Mediterranean, temperate and cold continental). Main conclusions At the turn of this century, convergence in growth synchrony across European forest ecosystems is coupled with coordinated warming-induced effects of drought on leaf physiology and tree growth spreading northwards. Such a tendency towards exacerbated moisture-sensitive growth and physiology could override positive effects of enhanced leaf intercellular CO2 concentrations, possibly resulting in Europe-wide declines of forest carbon gain in the coming decades. | ['andreu', 'hayles', 'bednarz', 'berninger', 'boettger', 'daux', 'dorado', 'linan', 'esper', 'filot', 'frank', 'grabner', 'gutierrez', 'haupt', 'helle', 'hilasvuori', 'jungner', 'kalela', 'brundin', 'krapiec', 'leuenberger', 'loader', 'marah', 'masson', 'delmotte', 'pawelczyk', 'pazdur', 'pierre', 'planells', 'pukiene', 'reynolds', 'henne', 'rinne', 'garmston', 'rita', 'saracino', 'saurer', 'schleser', 'shestakova', 'sonninen', 'stievenard', 'switsur', 'szychowska', 'krapiec', 'szymaszek', 'todaro', 'treydte', 'vitas', 'volta', 'waterhouse', 'weigl', 'wimmer'] | ","['andreu', 'hayles', 'bednarz', 'berninger', 'boettger', 'daux', 'dorado', 'linan', 'esper', 'filot', 'frank', 'grabner', 'gutierrez', 'haupt', 'helle', 'hilasvuori', 'jungner', 'kalela', 'brundin', 'krapiec', 'leuenberger', 'loader', 'marah', 'masson', 'delmotte', 'pawelczyk', 'pazdur', 'pierre', 'planells', 'pukiene', 'reynolds', 'henne', 'rinne', 'garmston', 'rita', 'saracino', 'saurer', 'schleser', 'shestakova', 'sonninen', 'stievenard', 'switsur', 'szychowska', 'krapiec', 'szymaszek', 'todaro', 'treydte', 'vitas', 'volta', 'waterhouse', 'weigl', 'wimmer']",4

Location Europe and North Africa (3070 degrees N, 10 degrees W40 degrees E). Methods We compiled close to 1000 annually resolved records of radial tree growth for all major European tree species and quantified changes in growth as a function of historical climatic variation. Sites were grouped using a neural network clustering technique to isolate spatiotemporal and species-specific climate response patterns. The resulting empirical climate sensitivities were compared with the sensitivities of net primary production (NPP) estimates derived from the ORCHIDEE-FM and LPJ-wsl dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Results We found coherent biogeographic patterns in climate response that depend upon (1) phylogenetic controls and (2) ambient environmental conditions delineated by latitudinal/elevational location. Temperature controls dominate forest productivity in high-elevation and high-latitude areas whereas moisture sensitive sites are widespread at low elevation in central and southern Europe. DGVM simulations broadly reproduce the empirical patterns, but show less temperature sensitivity in the boreal zone and stronger precipitation sensitivity towards the mid-latitudes. Main conclusions Large-scale forest productivity is driven by monthly to seasonal climate controls, but our results emphasize species-specific growth patterns under comparable environmental conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that carry-over effects from the previous growing season can significantly influence tree growth, particularly in areas with harsh climatic conditions an element not considered in most current-state DGVMs. Modeldata discrepancies suggest that the simulated climate sensitivity of NPP will need refinement before carbon-cycle climate feedbacks can be accurately quantified. | ['babst', 'bouriaud', 'carrer', 'ciais', 'frank', 'grabner', 'levanic', 'neuwirth', 'panayotov', 'poulter', 'tan', 'tegel', 'trouet', 'urbinati', 'wilson'] | ","['babst', 'bouriaud', 'carrer', 'ciais', 'frank', 'grabner', 'levanic', 'neuwirth', 'panayotov', 'poulter', 'tan', 'tegel', 'trouet', 'urbinati', 'wilson']",0
206,"Spring flood reconstruction from continuous and discrete tree ring series | This study proposes a method to reconstruct past spring flood discharge from continuous and discrete tree ring chronologies, since both have their respective strengths and weaknesses in northern environments. Ring width or density series provide uninterrupted records that are indirectly linked to regional discharge through a concomitant effect of climate on tree growth and streamflow. Conversely, discrete event chronologies constitute conspicuous records of past high water levels since they are constructed from trees that are directly damaged by the flood. However, the uncertainty of discrete series increases toward the past, and their relationships with spring discharge are often nonlinear. To take advantage of these two sources of information, we introduce a new transfer model technique on the basis of generalized additive model (GAM) theory. The incorporation of discrete predictors and the evaluation of the robustness of the nonlinear relationships are assessed using a jackknife procedure. We exemplify our approach in a reconstruction of May water supplies to the Caniapiscau hydroelectric reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada. We used earlywood density measurements as continuous variables and ice-scar dates around Lake Montausier in the James Bay area as a discrete variable. Strong calibration (0.57 &lt; 0.61 &lt; 0.75) and validation (0.27 &lt; 0.44 &lt; 0.58) R 2 statistics were obtained, thus highlighting the usefulness of the model. Our reconstruction suggests that, since ‚àº1965, spring floods have become more intense and variable in comparison with the last 150 years. We argue that a similar procedure can be used in each case where discrete and continuous tree ring proxies are used together to reconstruct past spring floods.

207,"Stable Isotopes in Tree Rings as Proxies for Winter Precipitation Changes in the Russian Arctic over the Past 150 Years | We present results from an analysis of tree ring width and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in tree ring cellulose of Siberian Spruce collected from remote forest islands in the northwestern Russian tundra. Ring width is often considered a proxy for summer temperatures. The aim of this pilot study was to test whether stable isotopes can provide additional information about climate during the growth of trees in this extreme environment. Comparison of delta C-13 and delta O-18 with observed meteorological data shows that there is a link between stable isotopes and winter precipitation. This may be explained by the strong influence that snow exerts on the isotopic composition of soil moisture during spring and early summer, when the new cellulose is formed. Our results show that winter precipitation in the study area was increasing from 1865-1900, and thereafter decreasing until similar to 1930. The 1960-1980 period was again rather humid, followed by a drying trend until 1990.

208,"Stardust component in tree rings | Tree-ring series collected from different parts of Arctic (Fennoscandia, Kola Peninsula and Northern Siberia) are investigated by means of the multi-taped method (MTM) of spectral analysis. Results of spectral analysis allow us to select the main periods of solar variability (22-, 30-33- and 80-90-year solar cycles) in Kola and Fennoscandia tree-ring chronologies. Besides it was found that only periodicities of around 20 years are present in Siberian and Stockholm series, respectively. With respect to 11-year periodicity, which is the most prominent one in sunspot number spectrum (Schwabe cycle) it may be said that it hardly appeared in Arctic tree-ring series. Although the 22-year cycles in climatic records are perceivable (it is also evident from our and other results), any physical mechanisms by which a reversal in the solar magnetic field could influence climate are still missing. To our mind, a potential cause of this phenomenon seems to be a variation of stardust flux inside the solar system. The most recent observations in frame of the DUST experiment on board the Ulysses spacecraft have shown that stardust level inside of the solar system was trebled during the recent solar maximum (Landgraf et al., 2003. Penetration of the beliosphere by the interstellar dust stream during solar maximum. Journal Geophysical Research 108, 8030). It is possible that the periodic increase of stardust in the solar system will influence the amount of extraterrestrial material that rains down to the Earth and consequently down to the Earth's atmosphere and may affect climate through alteration of atmospheric transparency and albedo.

The objective is to set a threshold, adapted to the sample distribution, which will make the distinction between high-magnitude years and remaining years, where the response of sampled trees is too weak to be attributed to a high-magnitude geomorphic event. The statistical framework proposed is based on the statistics of extremes. Through the use of simple, strong and effective mathematics, this model should strengthen the position of dendrogeomorphology in the evaluation and management of natural hazards. | ['germain'] | ",['germain'],0
210,"Subarctic and alpine tree line dynamics during the last 400 years in north-western and central Canada | Aim The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify episodes of establishment and mortality of young and mature trees at several sites at the alpine tree line in the western Northwest Territories and the latitudinal tree line in northern Manitoba; (2) infer changes in the structure and location of the tree line from patterns of establishment; (3) evaluate any relationship between these changes and climate; and (4) investigate sources of variability between sampling sites and study areas.Location Taiga Cordillera of the western Mackenzie Mountains in the Northwest Territories, and the western Hudson Bay Lowlands in northern Manitoba, Canada.Methods Recent tree line dynamics were examined at six climatically similar sites: three in the western Mackenzie Mountains and three around Churchill, Manitoba. Dendroecological techniques were employed to construct static age distributions of species present at each site. Static age structures, residuals from modelled age distributions, and reconstructions of dynamic stand density were used to identify patterns of establishment and mortality and to compare these to changes in climate.Results Tree line locations advanced and stand density increased during the early-to-mid-20th century around Churchill, although responses were not uniform across sites or species. Results were less conclusive in the Mackenzie Mountains, although the tree line probably advanced during the late 18th century, and stand infilling occurred during the mid-20th century. Correlation analyses with temperature suggest that conditions during establishment and particularly during recruitment are crucial for controlling tree line dynamics.Main conclusions Tree line advance and stand infilling have continued to the present at Churchill, while the tree line has stagnated in the western Mackenzie Mountains. The results of this study indicate that site-and species-specific responses play a large role in determining the tree line response at multiple scales, illustrating the complexity of tree line dynamics in the context of a changing climate. | ['kershaw', 'mamet'] | ","['kershaw', 'mamet']",2
211,"Summer solstice marks a seasonal shift in temperature sensitivity of stem growth and nitrogen-use efficiency in cold-limited forests | In boreal forests and alpine treelines, it is debatable how the temperature sensitivity of tree-ring growth should vary with changes in climate over time and the extent to which seasonal stem increments are controlled by leaf physiology. We aim to test the hypothesis that, in cold-limited forests, maximizing stem growth rate around summer solstice is closely related to foliage turnover, which generally results in high sensitivity of stem growth and less sensitivity of nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) to early-season temperatures. Our analysis was based on repeat-census observations of stem radial increment (2008-2013; made with dendrometers) and monthly litterfall (2007-2015) as well as the measurements of tree-ring width series (1960-2015; made with tree-ring cores) in two Tibetan treeline forests. NUE was estimated as the inverse of leaf-litter nitrogen concentration. We further examined a global dataset of tree-ring chronologies (1931-1990) from 139 sites across temperate and boreal coniferous forests in the northern high-latitude region. Weekly stem increments across species and years synchronously peaked around summer solstice, with more than half of annual increment produced in the first 28-35 days of the growing season when air and soil temperatures were still low. Monthly stem increments were positively related to previous-month litterfall, and higher litterfall generally resulted in higher NUE. NUE was insensitive or less sensitive to soil temperature in the early growing season. Among years, pre-peak increments were positively correlated with pre-solstice temperatures while post-peak increments varied little. The annual increment was dominated by and coherent with the pre-peak increment and well correlated with the ring-width measurements of monitored trees during 2008-2013. Variations in tree-ring width chronologies from the two Tibetan treelines and the global 139 forest sites mainly reflected the change of early summer temperatures. The findings suggest a day-length control on the linkage between seasonal stem growth and nitrogen cycling in a cold-limited forest ecosystem, and provide the basic for predicting responses of tree-ring growth and NUE to climatic warming. | ['li', 'liu', 'luo', 'pan', 'wright', 'zhang'] | ","['li', 'liu', 'luo', 'pan', 'wright', 'zhang']",0
212,"Summer Temperatures across Northern North-America - Regional Reconstructions from 1760 Using Tree-Ring Densities | Using maximum latewood density data from a network of coniferous trees, annually resolved series of average summer half-year (April-September) temperatures have been reconstructed for three regions of North America: Alaska and the Yukon (ALAYUK), the Mackenzie valley (MACKVA), and Quebec and Labrador (QUEBLA). The reconstructions primarily express temperature variability on interannual-to-decadal timescales and extend over the period from AD 1760. These reconstructions represent an extension of the mean climate history for these regions of over 100 years. The ALAYUK series shows relatively warm summers dominating the 1770s and 1820s. The 1760s, 1810s, 1860s, and 1890s were cold; 1810 was the coldest summer over the whole region, though it was very cold in 1783 in the extreme northwest. In MACKVA the 1780s and 1790s were warm, while the 1810s, 1830s, and late 1880s were cool. The summer of 1862 was exceptionally warm and 1836 was notably cold. In QUEBLA the 1800s, 1820s, and late 1890s were relatively warm, while the 1760s and 1810s were particularly cool. The summers of 1816 and 1817 were extremely cold. The dates of the extreme cold summers in each series emphasize the strong volcanic influence on extreme high-latitude temperatures. However, the reconstructions also highlight the large regional differences in the magnitude of this influence. The severity and spatial extent of severe conditions across western North America in the summer of 1810 supports earlier hypotheses of a major volcanic eruption in 1809 for which there is no historical evidence. | ['briffa', 'jones', 'schweingruber'] | ","['briffa', 'jones', 'schweingruber']",3
213,"Summer temperatures in the Canadian Rockies during the last millennium: a revised record | We present a significant update to a millennial summer temperature reconstruction (1073-1983) that was originally published in 1997. Utilising new tree-ring data ( predominantly Piceaengelmannii), the reconstruction is not only better replicated, but has been extended (950-1994) and is now more regionally representative. Calibration and veri. cation statistics were improved, with the new model explaining 53% of May-August maximum temperature variation compared to the original (39% of April-August mean temperatures). The maximum latewood density data, which are weighted more strongly in the regression model than ringwidth, were processed using regional curve standardisation to capture potential centennial to millennial scale variability. The reconstruction shows warm intervals, comparable to twentieth century values, for the first half of the eleventh century, the late 1300s and early 1400s. The bulk of the record, however, is below the 1901-1980 normals, with prolonged cool periods from 1200 to 1350 and from 1450 to the late 19th century. The most extreme cool period is observed to be in the 1690s. These reconstructed cool periods compare well with known regional records of glacier advances between 1150 and the 1300s, possibly in the early 1500s, early 1700s and 1800s. Evidence is also presented of the influence of solar activity and volcanic events on summer temperature in the Canadian Rockies over the last 1,000 years. Although this reconstruction is regional in scope, it compares well at multi-decadal to centennial scales with Northern Hemisphere temperature proxies and at millennial scales with reconstructions that were also processed to capture longer timescale variability. This coherence suggests that this series is globally important for the assessment of natural temperature variability over the last 1,000 years. | ['luckman', 'wilson'] | ","['luckman', 'wilson']",3
214,"Summer temperatures in eastern Taimyr inferred from a 2427-year late-Holocene tree-ring chronology and earlier floating series | A brief review is presented of the progress, to date, in constructing a long, continuous ring-width chronology from living and subfossil Siberian larch (Larix gmelinii) in the eastern part of the Taimyr peninsula. A near 2500-year chronology running up to the present has been assembled and several shorter, earlier series have been produced that a-re dated approximately on the basis of radiocarbon dates. A description is given of the production of separate early summer and annual mean temperature histories based on the recent chronology, spanning more than 2000 years. These two reconstructions are based on alternative methods of statistical processing of the measured tree-ring data. The early summer and annual reconstructions agree well in the long-term components of their variability, providing evidence for anomalous warmth in the third, tenth to twelfth, and twentieth centuries. and a prolonged cool period throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth, and in the early nineteenth centuries. The mean growth and other statistical parameters of the earlier chronologies also suggest that conditions for tree growth were very favourable in the earlier Holocene, particularly in the fourth millennium BC. This is strongly indicative of an early Holocene Climatic Optimum in Taimyr at that time. Other material in hand, and earlier published radiocarbon dates, demonstrate the feasibility of constructing continuous ring-width chronologies and temperature estimates extending throughout all of the last 8000 years. | ['naurzbaev', 'schweingruber', 'sidorova', 'vaganov'] | ","['naurzbaev', 'schweingruber', 'sidorova', 'vaganov']",2
215,"Summer temperature in northeastern Siberia since 1642 reconstructed from tracheid dimensions and cell numbers of Larix cajanderi | We reconstructed air temperature for two periods in the growth season from cell dimension and cell number variability in cross-dated tree rings of Larix cajanderi Mayr. from northeastern Siberia. Thirteen tree-ring chronologies based on cell size, cell wall thickness, and cell number were developed for AD 1642-1993. No clear evidence was found of an age-related trend in cell dimensions in the sampled materials, but cell numbers were correlated with cambial age. The chronologies contain strong temperature signals associated with the timing of xylem growth. We obtained reliable reconstructions of mean June temperature from the total cell number and July-September temperature from the cell wall thickness of latewood. June temperature and July-September temperature covaried for most of the period from AD 1642 to AD 1978. After that time, June temperature became cooler relative to July-September temperature. This difference caused disproportional changes in earlywood tracheids because of the late start of growth and cool conditions in June followed by warming during the rest of the season. The identification of this unusual recent change has shown that intraseasonal resolution may be achieved by cell dimension and cell number chronologies. | ['hughes', 'munro', 'panyushkina', 'vaganov'] | ","['hughes', 'munro', 'panyushkina', 'vaganov']",3
216,"A 263 Year Record of Summer Temperature for Northern Quebec Canada Reconstructed from Tree-Ring Data and Evidence of a Major Climatic Shift in the Early 1800's | Tree-ring data are used to reconstruct 263 years of summer temperatures at a site located near the northern tree line, in central western Quebec. A chronology comprising 20 ring-density time series is used in conjuction with a chronolgy comprising 20 ring-width time series in the regression analyses. The increased precision of the temperature estimates obtained by using density data as an additional proxy time series places the reconstruction and its interpretation on a firmer basis than it is when only ring-width data are used. The results are considerably improved over the use of either tree-ring parameter alone. The temperature reconstruction reflects a major cooling event in the early nineteenth century. Comparisons with other temperature and proxy data series support the idea of a global cooling event, with a persistence of the cool period of about three decades in high-latitude North America and of much shorter duration in other regions of the world. Volcanic activity in the early 1800's is suggested as partially responsible for the cooling event, but is considered inadequate as cause for the extended period of low-temperatures in the locale of this reconstruction. | ['ivanciu', 'jacoby', 'ulan'] | ","['ivanciu', 'jacoby', 'ulan']",4
217,"A summer temperature proxy from height increment of Scots pine since 1561 at the northern timberline in Fennoscandia | Height increments of 60 Scots pine trees were used to reconstruct mean June-August temperature variability at interannual to decadal scales from 1561 to 2004. Three standardization methods (67%, 33% flexible splines, and a fixed 22 years spline) were compared in building chronologies in order to optimize the frequency response in relation to major climatic forcing factors. The height-growth chronology built using the 33% spline standardization proved to have the most consistent and time-stable relationship with the summer temperatures. Among the monthly precipitation and temperature variables from previous June to current August, previous July shows the highest correlation with height growth. In addition, both previous June and previous August have significant positive correlations. Our final transfer model accounts for 32.5% of the dependent instrumental temperature variance between 1909 and 2004. The Fourier spectra of the height-growth chronology and mean summer temperature are very similar in appearance, both series having peaks at 2.7-3.2 years, 6.7 years and 15.7 years. Thus, the 444 years long summer temperature reconstruction is limited to high and medium frequencies. The coldest three summers in this record were experienced in years 1601, 1790 and 1903. Correspondingly, the summers of 1626, 1689 and 1598 were the warmest. The 1820s experienced the warmest 10-year mean, while the first decade of the twentieth century was the coldest. Among the 14 non-overlapping 30-year periods between 1561 and 1980, the period 1621-1650 was the warmest and the period 1591-1620 the coldest. | ['aalto', 'jalkanen', 'lindholm', 'ogurtsov', 'salminen'] | ","['aalto', 'jalkanen', 'lindholm', 'ogurtsov', 'salminen']",0

Climatic response analyses revealed that the ring width was primarily controlled by July-August temperature. The regression models that we used for statistical reconstruction passed the stringent calibration-verification tests used in dendroclimatology, resulting in the first quality-controlled tree-ring reconstruction for southern Kamchatka. The reconstructed temperature shows a cool period from the 1830s to the 1880s, followed by gradual warming until ca. 1940, then a cooling trend extending to the 1970s, and finally a warming trend continuing to the present. Spatial correlation analyses with sea surface temperature in the North Pacific indicated that the seas surrounding the Kamchatka peninsula play a role in modulating temperature variations in the study area whereas the effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are relatively weak. | ['furuta', 'sano', 'sweda'] | ","['furuta', 'sano', 'sweda']",3
220,"High Arctic summer warming tracked by increased Cassiope tetragona growth in the world's northernmost polar desert | Rapid climate warming has resulted in shrub expansion, mainly of erect deciduous shrubs in the Low Arctic, but the more extreme, sparsely vegetated, cold and dry High Arctic is generally considered to remain resistant to such shrub expansion in the next decades. Dwarf shrub dendrochronology may reveal climatological causes of past changes in growth, but is hindered at many High Arctic sites by short and fragmented instrumental climate records. Moreover, only few High Arctic shrub chronologies cover the recent decade of substantial warming. This study investigated the climatic causes of growth variability of the evergreen dwarf shrub Cassiope tetragona between 1927 and 2012 in the northernmost polar desert at 83 degrees N in North Greenland. We analysed climate-growth relationships over the period with available instrumental data (1950-2012) between a 102-year-long C.tetragona shoot length chronology and instrumental climate records from the three nearest meteorological stations, gridded climate data, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) indices. July extreme maximum temperatures (JulT(emx)), as measured at Alert, Canada, June NAO, and previous October AO, together explained 41% of the observed variance in annual C.tetragona growth and likely represent insitu summer temperatures. JulT(emx) explained 27% and was reconstructed back to 1927. The reconstruction showed relatively high growing season temperatures in the early to mid-twentieth century, as well as warming in recent decades. The rapid growth increase in C.tetragona shrubs in response to recent High Arctic summer warming shows that recent and future warming might promote an expansion of this evergreen dwarf shrub, mainly through densification of existing shrub patches, at High Arctic sites with sufficient winter snow cover and ample water supply during summer from melting snow and ice as well as thawing permafrost, contrasting earlier notions of limited shrub growth sensitivity to summer warming in the High Arctic. | ['blok', 'buchwal', 'elberling', 'loeffler', 'weijers'] | ","['blok', 'buchwal', 'elberling', 'loeffler', 'weijers']",3
221,"The supra-long Scots pine tree-ring record for Finnish Lapland: Part 1, chronology construction and initial inferences | This paper reviews the development of the current 'supra-long' pine chronology for northern Finnish Lapland. In the forest-tundra ecotone region of northern Finnish Lapland over 250 samples from living Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and over 1700 samples of subfossil pines have been collected for dendrochronological studies. In addition. over 1400 subfossils have been sampled from the forested area of Finnish Lapland. The goal of the research was to build a more than 7000-year long continuous pine ring-width chronology. The construction of the chronology is now completed. The intensive phase of the data collection and chronology building lasted about 10 years, 1989 to 1999. The major part of the Finnish Lapland master curve was constructed several years ago, but it was extremely difficult to bridge the c. 300-year gap, prior to 165 BC between the 'absolute' younger part of the chronology and the 'floating' older part. The crucial samples were identified and assembled in the chronology in early 1999, and there is now an unbroken pine chronology about 7500 years long constructed from the subfossil forest-limit pines of northern Finnish Lapland. The severe growth depression centred on 330 BC is likely to have been caused by increased wetness. A brief summary is presented of inferred tree-line changes from the location of the samples. | ['briffa', 'eronen', 'lindholm', 'merilainen', 'timonen', 'zetterberg'] | ","['briffa', 'eronen', 'lindholm', 'merilainen', 'timonen', 'zetterberg']",3

The chronology was built using regional curve standardization (RCS), which allows for long-term (low-frequency) variability to be extracted from this annually resolved record of 1087 samples from living trees and subfossil timber. Short- and long-term changes in reconstructed July temperatures are presented. The regression model accounts for 37% of the dependent instrumental temperature variance between AD 1879 and 1992.

223,"Surface air temperature variability reconstructed with tree rings for the Gulf of Alaska over the past 1200 years | A 1200-year-long tree-ring width record from living and subfossil mountain hemlock wood is used to reconstruct February through August temperatures for the Gulf of Alaska, providing a record of past climate variability for the Northeast Pacific sector that captures interannual to centennial timescales. The moderate elevation at the tree-ring sites has allowed these trees to retain their temperature signal without evidence of the so-called divergence effect, or underestimation of tree-ring inferred temperature trends, which is observed at many northern latitude forest locations. This divergence-free' reconstruction reveals centennial trends that include a warm interval centered on ad 950 for coastal Alaska that occurs around the time of the Medieval Warm Period', a warming that is only rivaled by recent decades. Spectral analysis of this reconstruction supports the centennial pacing identified as a 170-220-year cadence consistent with solar variability. On the decadal to bidecadal scale, the reconstruction reveals similar to 10- and 18-year cycles, which have been observed elsewhere in climate records for western North America and are linked to solar and lunar tidal forcing, respectively. Temperature minima that occur at ad 969-970 and 1698-1700 correspond with the timing of major volcanic events. This tree-ring reconstruction supports centennial modes of solar forcing as a driver of surface air temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska, with lunar tidal, solar variability, internal variability, and volcanism, impacting climate on annual to decadal timescales. | ['barclay', 'darrigo', 'frank', 'jarvis', 'vargo', 'wile', 'wilson'] | ","['barclay', 'darrigo', 'frank', 'jarvis', 'vargo', 'wile', 'wilson']",3
224,"Temperature-growth divergence in white spruce forests of Old Crow Flats, Yukon Territory, and adjacent regions of northwestern North America | We present a new 23-site network of white spruce ring-width chronologies near boreal treeline in Old Crow Flats, Yukon Territory, Canada. Most chronologies span the last 300 years and some reach the mid-16th century. The chronologies exhibit coherent growth patterns before the 1930s. However, since the 1930s, they diverge in trend and exhibit one of two contrasting, but well-replicated patterns we call Group 1 and Group 2. Over the instrumental period (1930-2007) Group 1 sites were inversely correlated with previous-year July temperatures while Group 2 sites were positively correlated with growth-year June temperatures. At the broader northwestern North America (NWNA) scale, we find that the Group 1 and Group 2 patterns are common to a number of white spruce chronologies, which we call NWNA 1 and NWNA 2 chronologies. The NWNA 1 and NWNA 2 chronologies also share a single coherent growth pattern prior to their divergence (ca. 1950s). Comparison of the NWNA 1/NWNA 2 chronologies against gridded 20th-century temperatures for NWNA and reconstructed northern hemisphere summer temperatures (AD 1300-2000) indicates that all sites responded positively to temperature prior to the mid-20th century (at least back to AD 1300), but that some changed to a negative response (NWNA 1) while others maintained a positive response (NWNA 2). The spatial extent of divergence implies a large-scale forcing. As the divergence appears to be restricted to the 20th century, we suggest that the temperature response shift represents a moisture stress caused by an anomalously warm, dry 20th-century climate in NWNA, as indicated by paleoclimatic records. However, because some sites do not diverge and are located within a few kilometres of divergent sites, we speculate that site-level factors have been important in determining the susceptibility of sites to the large-scale drivers of divergence. | ['pisaric', 'porter'] | ","['pisaric', 'porter']",0
225,"Temperature Histories from Tree-Rings and Corals | Recent temperature trends in long tree-ring and coral proxy temperature histories are evaluated and compared in an effort to objectively determine how anomalous twentieth century temperature changes have been. These histories mostly reflect regional variations in summer warmth from the tree rings and annual warmth from the corals. In the Northern Hemisphere, the North American tree-ring temperature histories and those from the north Polar Urals. covering the past 1000 or more years, indicate that the twentieth century has been anomalously warm relative to the past. In contrast, the tree-ring history from northern Fennoscandia indicates that summer temperatures during the 'Medieval Warm Period' were probably warmer on average than those than during this century. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tree-ring temperature histories from South America show no indication:of recent warming, which is in accordance with local instrumental records. In contrast, the tree-ring records from Tasmania and New Zealand indicate that the twentieth century has been unusually warm particularly since 1960. The coral temperature histories from the Galapagos Islands and the Great Barrier Reef are in broad agreement with the tree-ring temperature histories in those sectors, with the former showing recent cooling and the latter showing recent warming;that may be unprecedented. Overall, the region;il temperature histories evaluated here broadly support the larger-scale evidence for anomalous twentieth century warming based on instrumental records. However, this warming cannot be confirmed as an unprecedented event in all regions. | ['cook'] | ",['cook'],0

We developed a cumulative measure of statistical fit between two types of fire events (early- and late-season fires) and ring-width chronologies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (total ring- and latewood-width chronologies). For a given site, the statistical fit between fires and tree-ring data tended to decrease with an increasing proportion of unique fire years. Distance from a site to the nearest village (deemed to be a proxy of human impact) explained 50% of the variation in statistical fit between fires and tree-ring data. The fit decreased in the majority of the sites from the earlier (1424-1700) to the later (1700-1960) periods. We interpret this to be a result of increased human impact on the fire regime since 1700 due to intensified colonization of the area. | ['angelstam', 'drobyshev', 'majewski', 'niklasson'] | ","['angelstam', 'drobyshev', 'majewski', 'niklasson']",2
227,"Testing the hypothesis of post-volcanic missing rings in temperature sensitive dendrochronological data | The precise, annual dating control, inherent to dendrochronology, has recently been questioned through a combined analysis of tree-growth and coupled climate models (Mann et al. (2012; hereafter MAN12)) suggesting single tree-rings in temperature limited environments are missing following large volcanic events. We test this hypothesis of missing, post-volcanic rings by using a compilation of maximum late-wood density (MXD) records that are typically used for reconstructing temperature and the detection of volcanic events, together with a unique set of long instrumental station data from Europe reaching back into the early 18th century. We investigate the temporal coherence between tree-ring MXD and observed summer temperatures before and after the most significant, precisely dated, volcanic event of the past 1000 years, the 1815 Tambora eruption widely known as the cause for the 1816 ""year without a summer"". Comparison of existing and newly developed MXD chronologies from cold environments in Northern Scandinavia ((r) over bar North = 0.70, N=3) and the European Alps, including the Pyrenees, ((r) over bar central = 0.46, N=4) reveals significant interseries correlations over the 1722-1976 common period, suggesting coherence among these independently developed timeseries. Comparisons of these data with observed JJA temperatures - from 1722 to 1976, a 94-year pre-Tambora (1722-1815), and a 94-year post-Tambora (1817-1910) period - reveals significant and temporally stable correlations ranging from 0.32 to 0.68. However, if we assume the 1816 ring is missing in the MXD chronologies (i.e., shift the pre-Tambora data by one year), all proxy/instrumental correlations fall apart approaching zero. Results from an additional experiment, where the long instrumental record is replaced by an annually resolved, 500-year, summer temperature reconstruction derived from documentary evidence, corroborates the findings from the first experiment: significant positive correlations with the unmolested chronologies and zero correlation with the perturbed chronologies back to 1500 AD. These elementary analyses indicate that either the tree-ring chronologies are correctly dated, i.e., no is ring missing in the year without a summer, or that both the long instrumental and documentary records contain dating uncertainties. As the latter is unlikely, we conclude the MAN12 hypothesis on post-volcanic missing rings can be rejected based on simple comparisons of tree-ring, instrumental and documentary data over the past 300-500 years from Central and Northern Europe.

By including data from relatively young trees for the most recent period, a previously noted decline in recent MXD is eliminated. Non-climatological growth trends in the data are removed using Regional Curve Standardization (RCS), thus producing TRW and MXD chronologies with preserved low-frequency variability. The chronologies are calibrated using local and regional instrumental climate records. A boot-strapped response function analysis using regional climate data shows that tree growth is forced by April-August temperatures and that the regression weights for MXD are much stronger than for TRW. The robustness of the reconstruction equation is verified by independent temperature data and shows that 63-64% of the instrumental inter-annual variation is captured by the tree-ring data. This is a significant improvement compared to previously published reconstructions based on tree-ring data from Tornetrask. A divergence phenomenon around AD 1800, expressed as an increase in TRW that is not paralleled by temperature and MXD, is most likely an effect of major changes in the density of the pine population at this northern tree-line site. The bias introduced by this TRW phenomenon is assessed by producing a summer temperature reconstruction based on MXD exclusively. The new data show generally higher temperature estimates than previous reconstructions based on Tornetrask tree-ring data. The late-twentieth century, however, is not exceptionally warm in the new record: On decadal-to-centennial timescales, periods around AD 750, 1000, 1400, and 1750 were equally warm, or warmer. The 200-year long warm period centered on AD 1000 was significantly warmer than the late-twentieth century (p < 0.05) and is supported by other local and regional paleoclimate data. The new tree-ring evidence from Tornetrask suggests that this ""Medieval Warm Period"" in northern Fennoscandia was much warmer than previously recognized. | ['grudd'] | ",['grudd'],0
231,"Tree growth decrease between AD 1800 and 1840 in subarctic and highland regions of Russia | I analyzed the variability of ring-width indices from AD 1800 to 1840 in 110 temperature-sensitive tree-ring chronologies developed for subarctic and mountain regions of Russia in order to discover any possible effect of the catastrophic Tambora eruption in 1815 on tree growth and climatic conditions. In most regions studied there was intensive cooling from 1810 to 1840. Extremely low ring-width indices (60-95% below average) during the first three years after the eruption occurred in the northern regions of the Russian Plain, the Polar, Subpolar and Northern Ural Mountains and the northwestern part of the West-Siberian Plain. It is possible that the Tambora eruption, which occurred during a period of short-term cooling, caused an even greater decrease in summer temperatures in those regions in 1816-1818. | ['shiyatov'] | ",['shiyatov'],0
232,"Holocene tree-line dynamics and inferred climatic changes in the Abisko area, northern Sweden, based on macrofossil and pollen records | Lake-sediment records of pollen and macroscopic plant remains of terrestrial origin provide evidence of long-term changes in forest composition close to the altitudinal tree-line in the Abisko area, northernmost Sweden. A dominance of mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. tortuosa (Ledeb.) Nyman) with a field-layer of ferns, grasses and sedges suggests that an oceanic climate with relatively high precipitation existed during the early Holocene. Macrofossils of mountain birch were found 300-400 m above the present tree-line which corresponds to a 1.5-2 degrees C higher summer temperature than at present. Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) was present to some extent at altitudes above its present limit during the early Holocene. A pronounced expansion of pine took place above its present limit around 6300 cal. BP (5500 BP). This is interpreted as a result of successively drier and more continental climatic conditions. A decreased abundance of pine from c. 5200 cal. BP (4700 BP), followed by a gradual retraction of the upper limit of pine during the later part of the Holocene, can be attributed mainly to long-term changes in solar radiation. A decline in the upper limit of pine of c. 175 m since 4500 cal. BP (4000 BP) is believed to represent a decrease in growing-season temperature of c. 1.5 degrees C. | ['barnekow'] | ",['barnekow'],0
233,"A tree-ring based reconstruction of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation since 1567 AD | We present a tree-ring based reconstruction of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) which demonstrates that strong, low-frequency (60-100 yr) variability in basin-wide (0-70degreesN) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) has been a consistent feature of North Atlantic climate for the past five centuries. Intervention analysis of reconstructed AMO indicates that 20th century modes were similar to those in the preceding similar to350 yr, and wavelet spectra show robust multidecadal oscillations throughout the reconstruction. Though the exact relationships between low-frequency SST modes, higher frequency (similar to7-25 yr) atmospheric modes (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation), and terrestrial climates must still be resolved, our results confirm that the AMO should be considered in assessments of past and future Northern Hemisphere climates. | ['betancourt', 'graumlich', 'gray', 'pederson'] | ","['betancourt', 'graumlich', 'gray', 'pederson']",0
234,"A 2233-year tree-ring chronology of subarctic black spruce (Picea mariana): growth forms response to long-term climate change | We present the longest tree-ring chronology to date in northeastern North America (2233 years; 227 BCE - 2005 CE), resulting from several research projects conducted at the subarctic treeline in northern Quebec. This raw chronology of tree-ring width includes 464 black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) shrubs (krummholz) growing in wetlands and preserved within peatlands. An indexed series of 152 erect black spruce trees that have lived in wetlands is also presented, covering the period 216 BCE to 1619 CE. We compared these chronologies to a tree-ring series including 116 black spruce trees and krummholz having grown on well-drained lichen woodlands over the period 1304-2000 CE. These chronologies highlight the major climatic periods of the last two millennia. Floating chronologies dating from 2500 to 3500 years ago were also developed from trees preserved in frozen peat. Growth rings from this period are much wider than those of the last 2233 years, suggesting warm climatic conditions and permafrost-free peatlands during the transition from mid- to late Holocene. The three subarctic chronologies presented here underscore the relevance and usefulness of tree growth rings and growth forms as ecological tools to assess the influence of climate on subarctic ecosystems. | ['arseneault', 'asselin', 'delwaide', 'lavoie', 'payette'] | ","['arseneault', 'asselin', 'delwaide', 'lavoie', 'payette']",3
235,"Tree rings, delta C-13 and climate in Picea glauca growing near Churchill, subarctic Manitoba, Canada | White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) trees were sampled to investigate the relationship between ring width and delta C-13 as well as between these descriptors and climate. Cross-sections from eight white spruce trees growing in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, subartic Manitoba, with an establishment date prior to 1775 were selected from our archive. For each cross-section, two radii were measured to produce ring-width chronologies. For stable-carbon isotope measurements, every fifth ring (2000, 1995, ... 1750) was analyzed separately from each tree, whereas approximately equal masses from the eight trees were pooled into composite samples for each of the intermediate years mixing masses from each tree equal to that from the tree with the least amount. Alpha-cellulose was extracted and delta C-13 was determined using continuous-flow mass spectrometry. The ring-width residual chronology derived from eight trees was highly correlated to that previously developed for the area. A small but significant correlation was also found between the ring-width and the delta C-13 residual chronologies. The climate signal contained in both ring-width and the delta C-13 residual chronologies suggests that warm early summers were conducive to larger rings whereas the delta C-13 best reflects the overall growing season temperature. Precipitation, relative humidity and/or drought index have little to no association with either chronology. Significant correlations were observed between delta C-13 and the historical ice records from the Hudson Bay Co. archive data suggesting that during long (warm) growing season the C-13 content of alpha-cellulose increases. Our results indicate that both ring-width and delta C-13 provide complementary information. Future work will involve looking at long-term trends in carbon isotope ratios and the potential use of delta C-13 for dendroclimatic reconstruction. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Duplicate cores, from 12 to 15 trees per site, provide time series for a suite of growth parameters including earlywood (spring), latewood (summer) and total (annual) ring widths and mean earlywood, mean latewood, minimum and maximum ring density. These data form the basis for extensive analyses of intra- and inter-site parameter comparisons and regional climate/tree-growth comparisons.

237,"The Tree-Ring Record of Drought on the Canadian Prairies | Ring-width data from 138 sites in the Canadian Prairie Provinces and adjacent regions are used to estimate summer drought severity during the past several hundred years. The network was divided into five regional groups based on geography, tree species, and length of record: the eastern Rockies, northern Saskatchewan, central Manitoba, southern Manitoba, and northwestern Ontario. Regional tree-ring records are primarily related to summer moisture and drought conditions, and are less responsive to droughts caused by deficits in winter precipitation. These summer-sensitive data are not linearly related to major modes of climate variability, including ENSO and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which primarily affect the climate of western Canada during winter. Extended drought records inferred from tree rings indicate that drought on the Canadian Prairies has exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity over the last several centuries. For northern Saskatchewan and northwestern Ontario, intervals of persistently low tree growth during the twentieth century were just as long as or longer than low-growth intervals in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. Longer records from southern Alberta suggest that the most intense dry spell in that area during the last 500 yr occurred during the 1720s. At the eastern side of the prairies, the longest dry event is centered around 1700 and may coincide with low lake stands in Manitoba, Minnesota, and North Dakota. Although the Canadian Prairies were dry at times during the 1500s, there is no regional analog to the sixteenth-century ""megadroughts'' that affected much of the western United States and northern Mexico. | ['george', 'girardin', 'macdonald', 'meko', 'nielsen', 'pederson', 'sauchyn', 'tardif', 'watson'] | ","['george', 'girardin', 'macdonald', 'meko', 'nielsen', 'pederson', 'sauchyn', 'tardif', 'watson']",0
238,"Tree-ring estimates of Pacific decadal climate variability | Decadal-scale oscillatory modes of atmosphere-ocean variability have recently been identified in instrumental studies of the Pacific sector. The regime shift around 1976 is one example of such a fluctuation, which has been shown to have significantly impacted climate and the environment along the coastline of the western N and S Americas. The length of meteorological data for the Pacific and western Americas critically limits analyses of such decadal-scale climate variability. Here we present reconstructions of the annual Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index based on western North American tree-ring records which account for up to 53% of the instrumental variance and extend as far back as AD 1700. The PDO reconstructions indicate that decadal-scale climatic shifts have occurred prior to the period of instrumental record. Evaluation of temperature and precipitation-sensitive tree-ring series from the northeast Pacific as well as these reconstructions reveals evidence for a shift towards less pronounced interdecadal variability after about the middle 1800s. Our analyses also suggest that sites from both the northeast Pacific coast as well as the subtropical Americas need to be included in proxy data sets used to reconstruct the PDO. | ['darrigo', 'villalba', 'wile'] | ","['darrigo', 'villalba', 'wile']",2

240,"Tree-ring evidence extends the historic northern range limit of severe defoliation by insects in the aspen stands of western Quebec, Canada | A dendrochronological reconstruction of insect outbreaks was conducted along a latitudinal gradient from 46 degrees N to 54 degrees N in the boreal forest of western Quebec, Canada. Tree-ring chronologies of the host species, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), were constructed to identify periods of severe defoliation and comparisons were made with tree-ring chronologies of nonhost species. In addition, the frequency of white and narrow rings was used to further confirm the occurrence of insect outbreaks at these latitudes. Some major outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony at the regional scale, but the initiation year, intensity, and extent of the outbreaks varied spatially. For example, the 1950s outbreaks were observed from 1951 to 1952 at 46 degrees N, from 1953 to 1954 at 47 degrees N, and from 1954 to 1956 at 48 degrees N. Other major outbreaks like the 1964 and 1980 outbreaks were fairly well synchronized at northern latitudes. The observed outbreaks in trembling aspen stands at 54 degrees N also provided clear evidence that severe insect defoliation occurs much further north than the currently reported range limit, that is, between 49 degrees N and 51 degrees N, of the most important trembling aspen defoliator, the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria). Our study demonstrated that careful identification of white rings in host species can provide valid information allowing the expansion of the forestry insect inventory database both at temporal and spatial scales. | ['bergeron', 'berninger', 'denneler', 'huang', 'tardif'] | ","['bergeron', 'berninger', 'denneler', 'huang', 'tardif']",2
241,"A tree-ring field reconstruction of Fennoscandian summer hydroclimate variability for the last millennium | Hydroclimatological extremes, such as droughts and floods, are expected to increase in frequency and intensity with global climate change. An improved knowledge of its natural variability and the underlying physical mechanisms for changes in the hydrological cycle will help understand the response of extreme hydroclimatic events to climate warming. This study presents the first gridded hydroclimatic reconstruction (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid resolution), as expressed by the warm season Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), for most of Fennoscandia. A point-by-point regression approach is used to develop the reconstruction from a network of moisture sensitive tree-ring chronologies spanning over the past millennium. The reconstruction gives a unique opportunity to examine the frequency, severity, persistence, and spatial characteristics of Fennoscandian hydroclimatic variability in the context of the last 1,000 years. The full SPEI reconstruction highlights the seventeenth century as a period of frequent severe and widespread hydroclimatic anomalies. Although some severe extremes have occurred locally throughout the domain over the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the period is surprisingly free from any spatially extensive anomalies. The twentieth century is not anomalous in terms of the number of severe and spatially extensive hydro climatic extremes in the context of the last millennium. Principle component analysis reveals that there are two dominant modes of spatial moisture variability across Fennoscandia. The same patterns are evident in the observational record and in the reconstructed dataset over the instrumental era and two paleoperiods. The 500 mb pressure patterns associated with the two modes suggests the importance of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation. | ['bjorklund', 'cook', 'linderholm', 'seftigen'] | ","['bjorklund', 'cook', 'linderholm', 'seftigen']",2
242,"Tree-Ring Inferred Atmospheric Mercury Concentrations in the Mackenzie Delta (NWT, Canada) Peaked in the 1970s but Are Increasing Once More | Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant emitted to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources, which have varied over time in response to increased industrialization and pollution control measures. Tree rings have shown promise for reconstructing past atmospheric Hg(0) concentrations to expand on the temporally and spatially limited data provided by the instrumental record, producing high-resolution data with absolutely dated chronologies. Here, we present a similar to 400 year reconstruction of atmospheric Hg(0) based on white spruce (Picea glauca) tree rings from a pristine coastal area in Northwestern Canada (Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories). The tree-ring record shows that Hg concentrations did not begin to increase significantly above baseline until similar to 1875, coinciding with increased industrialization in Europe and North America. Hg concentrations reached a maximum in the 1970s and subsequently declined until the end of the 20th century, which is consistent with the trends in modeled global tropospheric Hg(0) concentrations based on the latest Hg-emission inventories. However, unlike many other locations in the northern hemisphere, the Mackenzie Delta tree-ring record exhibits a rebound in Hg(0) concentrations since the turn of the century, likely reflecting the increase in upwind Asian industrial emissions. The relative enrichment in inferred modern atmospheric Hg(0) relative to preindustrial concentrations [enrichment factors (EF) = 1.54] is similar to other EF values obtained from tree rings, but lower than those based on models and sedimentary archives. Tree-ring Hg concentrations in the Mackenzie Delta were higher than at a continental site also located in northwestern Canada, suggesting that ocean Hg(0) evasion and permafrost slumping contribute to higher local atmospheric concentrations. | ['ghotra', 'lehnherr', 'pisaric', 'porter'] | ","['ghotra', 'lehnherr', 'pisaric', 'porter']",2

The reconstruction covers AD 1650-1975 and is based largely on chronologies from circumpolar-Arctic and circum-North Atlantic areas. It accounts for 48% of the variance in the instrumental AO record from 1900 to 1975, verifies using independent data, and exhibits its largest variance at low frequencies. Positive levels during 20th century periods equal or exceed values back to AD 1650. Trends (including lower values during 'Little Ice Age' periods) resemble those of Arctic temperature reconstructions, reflecting some data overlap, but also the strong link between the AO and northern temperatures. A reconstruction of an AO summer sea level pressure index shows similar trends. Comparison of these reconstructions with proxies of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and other indices can help clarify relationships between the AO and NAO, at least during the boreal warm season. | ['cook', 'darrigo', 'jacoby', 'mann'] | ","['cook', 'darrigo', 'jacoby', 'mann']",3
244,"Tree-ring stable isotopes for regional discharge reconstruction in eastern Labrador and teleconnection with the Arctic Oscillation | In northeastern Canada (Labrador), instrumental climatic data cover less than 70 years and long reconstructions from natural archives are non-existent. This study specifically aims at helping filling this gap of knowledge by testing the possibility of reconstructing the regional 1800-2009 discharge of the lower Churchill River from black spruce tree-ring delta C-13 and delta O-18 series. The results illustrate direct relationships of summer climatic variables/derived parameter (maximum temperature, total precipitation and vapor pressure deficit) with tree-ring isotope values. Importantly, they show an inverse correlation between combined tree-ring isotope series and regional river discharge due to common climate forcing. To a lesser extent, transpiration also affects the river discharge and tree-ring isotopic compositions. The reconstructed river discharge series agrees with an independent reconstruction based on the ANATEM method (1880-2009 period). The agreement between the two reconstructions validates the two approaches for reconstructing regional hydroclimatic conditions at high latitudes. Moreover, the reconstructions suggest that summer discharge has decreased over the past 200 years in eastern Labrador and more broadly at the Quebec-Labrador peninsula scale. This trend correlates with the long-term summer Arctic Oscillation (AO) that influences summer regional climatic conditions. This research contributes with other studies to build up observations linking summer AO and eastern Canada climatic conditions, and calls for research on mechanisms explaining these relationships during summer. | ['alvarez', 'begin', 'brigode', 'dinis', 'marion', 'savard'] | ","['alvarez', 'begin', 'brigode', 'dinis', 'marion', 'savard']",2

Rupr. growing in a wide open forest close to the tree line in the Kronotsky National Park. Reflecting strong climatic control over tree growth not only within the study area but also more extensively over central Kamchatka, our chronology was well correlated with those from other larch sites. Response analysis with 10-day mean temperature revealed that the ring width was primarily controlled by the temperature of early summer, i.e., of late May through late June (40 days). While the regression models for a formal reconstruction failed to pass stringent verification tests commonly used in dendroclimatology, the relationship between tree growth and climate was statistically significant and credible. We therefore used our chronology as a proxy of early summer temperature. The chronology shows a cool period from the 1660s until the 1680s, followed by gradual warming until ca. 1800, then by a slight cooling trend extending to ca. 1910, and a warming trend continuing up to the present, with decadal fluctuations throughout the chronology. The warming trend found in our chronology over the twentieth century is generally consistent with the ones commonly appearing in higher latitudes. | ['furuta', 'sano', 'sweda'] | ","['furuta', 'sano', 'sweda']",3

Density variations indicate summer temperatures are now warm but not above some previous levels occurring prior to this century. The early cooler period, corresponding to the Little Ice Age, was interrupted by brief warm intervals.

All density variables (maximum, minimum, earlywood and latewood densities) among the three types of trees were similar, whereas ring width was significantly higher in living trees than in dead and subfossil trees. Correlation of the indexed series from living and dead trees and from dead and subfossil trees that grew during the same periods were higher for maximum density (r = 0.70, 0.63) and mean latewood density (r = 0.65, 0.66) than for minimum density (r = 0.16, 0.35) and ring width (r = 0.15, 0.49), respectively. Maximum density and mean latewood density were significantly correlated with all temperature variables: mean annual (January-December) and growing season (May-September) temperatures, sum of degree days and frost-free days. Accordingly, maximum and latewood density in tree-rings of spruce stems at tree-line can be considered as a function of summer-temperature distributions and different types of trees can be combined for the reconstruction of long-term climatic trends due to their synchronous variations. ¬© 2001 Arnold. | ['be√©gin', 'payette', 'wang'] | ","['be√©gin', 'payette', 'wang']",3
248,"Tree-ring width and maximum latewood density at the North American tree line: Parameters of climatic change | In remote subarctic North America, instrumental records are very short and sparsely distributed. Yet a long-term understanding of subarctic climate is critical to studies of global change. Annual tree-ring width and maximum latewood density are complementary, high-resolution parameters with different environmental and physiological controls that can be used to assess recent centuries of climatic change. In this paper we present a comparison of the different temperature information inferred from these parameters for white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), a dominant North American latitudinal tree line species. Ring-width and maximum latewood density chronologies (with a common period from 1720-1977) are shown for five sites along a widely spaced transect of the forest-tundra transition in northern Canada. The positive temperature response to maximum latewood density to year to year local temperatures is more consistent and covers a longer portion of the growing season than does that of ring width. Unlike density, the ring-width data show a preference for cold spring conditions. Some, but not all, of the ring-width and density series display increases during the recent century's large-scale climatic warming trend. It is concluded that both types of parameters are necessary for understanding changes in climate and forest dynamics at the northern tree line. | ['darrigo', 'free', 'jacoby'] | ","['darrigo', 'free', 'jacoby']",4

The aim of this study is to provide an analysis of the centuries-old spatiotemporal dynamics of larch trees at the upper limit of their growth (mountain massif Rai-Iz, Polar Urals, Russia). We used a ground-based method of mapping the remnants of trees that grew in the study area and died during the Little Ice Age. Aerial photographs from the 1960s and high-spatial-resolution satellite images from 2015 were used as data sources to define the locations of trees. Maps of the forest-tundra phytocoenochoras (areas of the terrain that are relatively homogeneous for one or more components of vegetation and/or other indicators) were created using a modified method of boundary detection between forest parcels with different stand densities. The proposed method of boundary detection between the main types of phytocoenochoras allowed us to identify a 15% total increase in areas of closed and open forest and areas with sparse tree growth, as well as a decrease in areas of tundra with single trees over these last decades. Using our spatiotemporal analysis of foresttundra demographics over the last 50 years, we found that the number of trees in the ecotone had doubled. However, modern trees have not yet reached the areas occupied by trees in the past. | ['fomin', 'mikhailovich', 'shiyatov'] | ","['fomin', 'mikhailovich', 'shiyatov']",4
250,"Trends in recent temperature and radial tree growth spanning 2000 years across northwest Eurasia | This paper describes variability in trends of annual tree growth at several locations in the high latitudes of Eurasia, providing a wide regional comparison over a 2000-year period. The study focuses on the nature of local and widespread tree-growth responses to recent warming seen in instrumental observations, available in northern regions for periods ranging from decades to a century. Instrumental temperature data demonstrate differences in seasonal scale of Eurasian warming and the complexity and spatial diversity of tree-growing-season trends in recent decades. A set of long tree-ring chronologies provides empirical evidence of association between inter-annual tree growth and local, primarily summer, temperature variability at each location. These data show no evidence of a recent breakdown in this association as has been found at other high-latitude Northern Hemisphere locations. Using Kendall's concordance, we quantify the time-dependent relationship between growth trends of the long chronologies as a group. This provides strong evidence that the extent of recent widespread warming across northwest Eurasia, with respect to 100- to 200-year trends, is unprecedented in the last 2000 years. An equivalent analysis of simulated temperatures using the HadCM3 model fails to show a similar increase in concordance expected as a consequence of anthropogenic forcing. | ['briffa', 'eronen', 'grudd', 'hantemirov', 'melvin', 'naurzbaev', 'shishov', 'vaganov'] | ","['briffa', 'eronen', 'grudd', 'hantemirov', 'melvin', 'naurzbaev', 'shishov', 'vaganov']",0
251,"Twentieth-century Scots pine growth variations in the central Scandinavian Mountains related to climate change | Climate-sensitive trees are valuable for reconstructing past climates, but they also can be used to assess the impacts of environmental change, such as global warming, on forest ecosystems. Growth variability and growth responses to climate of a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) tree-ring width chronology, from the treeline in the central Scandinavian Mountains, were studied throughout the 20th century. Summer temperatures, especially in July, were the most influential climate factor for tree growth. Correlation analyses in three 30-yr periods showed that growth responses to climate varied through time, being particularly low in 1931 to 1960. Nevertheless, tree growth around 1950 was the highest for 320 yr, implying optimal growth conditions. This growth increase appears to be a response to increased summer temperatures, a lengthening of the growing season, and a temporal change in the atmospheric circulation pattern. Despite a continuation of seemingly favorable growth conditions in the latter half of the 20th century, pine growth decreased after the 1950s. It appears that high-altitude pine experienced stress that surpassed the positive effect of improved growth season climate. Since pine growth decline coincided with an unprecedented strong and positive period of wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a measure of strength of westerly winds bringing mild and moist air masses over Scandinavia, it is proposed that milder and wetter winters caused growth stress, and hence reduced growth, in high-altitude central Sweden. | ['linderholm'] | ",['linderholm'],4
252,"Variability, contingency and rapid change in recent subarctic alpine tree line dynamics | Boundaries between forest and tundra ecosystems, tree lines, are expected to advance in altitude and latitude in response to climate warming. However, varied responses to 20th century warming suggest that in addition to temperature, tree line dynamics are mediated by species-specific traits and environmental conditions at landscape and local scales.We examined recent tree line dynamics at six topographically different, but climatically similar, sites in south-west Yukon, Canada. Dendroecological techniques were used to reconstruct changes in density of the dominant tree species, white spruce (Picea glauca), and to construct static age distributions of willow (Salix spp.), one of two dominant shrub genera. Data were analysed to identify periods and rates of establishment and mortality and to relate these to past climate.Tree line elevation and stand density increased significantly during the early to mid 20th century. However, this change was not uniform across sites. Spruce advanced rapidly on south-facing slopes and tree line rose 65-85 m in elevation. Tree line did not advance on north-facing slopes, but stand density increased 40-65%. Differences observed between aspects were due primarily to the differential presence of permafrost. Additional variability among sites was related to slope and vegetation type. Results were less conclusive for willow, but evidence for an advance was found at two sites.Increases in stand density were strongly correlated with summer temperatures. The period of rapid change coincided with a 30-year period of above average temperatures, beginning in 1920. The highest correlations were obtained using a forward average of 30-50 years, supporting the hypothesis that tree line dynamics are controlled more by conditions influencing recruitment than by establishment alone.The changes observed at several sites are suggestive of a threshold response and challenge the notion that tree lines respond gradually to climate warming. Overall, the results provide further evidence to support the idea that the pattern and timing of change is contingent on local, landscape, and regional-scale factors, as well as species' biology. | ['danby', 'hik'] | ","['danby', 'hik']",2

Trunks of old pines have been preserved in large quantities in small lakes of northern Lapland and they constitute a valuable source of information of past climate. Discs cut from the subfossil logs are well suited for dendrochronological studies. It is shown by several studies that the radial growth of present forest-limit pine is strongly determined by the summer temperatures. Thus a long pine chronology can be used to reconstruct time series of past summer temperature variations. A 7600 yr long tree-ring chronology has been constructed, but it still has uncertain correlation between the ring-widths around 400-100 B.C. However, there is a 2000 yr long ""absolute"" chronology, which will eventually be connected to a 5000 yr long ""floating"" chronology. The tree rings show the interannual variability of temperatures, but the distinction of the low-frequency variability is problematic. Tree-rings indicate that the interannual variability has increased during the latter part of the Holocene, presumably as a consequence of increased instability of the climatic system. Correlations are made with other climatic proxy data, but they have not allowed a consistent picture of the Holocene short-term temperature variations. It is clear that the humidity has increased in northern Fennoscandia during the past 5000-4000 yr. A period of harsh climatic conditions occurred 2500-2000 yr ago. It was an unfavourable time for the growth of forest-limit pine and in that sense it seems to have been a more severe climatic disturbance than the ""Little Ice Age"" in historical times a few hundred years ago. ¬© 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

255,"Variation of annual ring parameters and delta C-13 isotope contents in Larix cajanderi Mayr from eastern Yakutia | The long-term chronologies according to the width, density, and proportion of stable isotopes C-13/C-12 in annual rings of Larix cajanderi Mayr were made for trees of one plot in the territory of Eastern Siberia. The dendroclimatic analysis of the annual ring structure showed that the variation of its parameters reflected the information about changes in growth conditions of larch trees. The obtained relationships between the parameters of annual rings and those of meteorological factors are determined by physiology of larch under conditions of severely continental climate. The combined use of a complex of data oil tree rings will allow to characterize more completely growth conditions and fulfil more correct dendroclimatic reconstructions for a particular region. | ['helle', 'kirdyanov', 'nikolaev', 'shlezer'] | ","['helle', 'kirdyanov', 'nikolaev', 'shlezer']",2

257,"Variations in tree ring stable isotope records from northern Finland and their possible connection to solar activity | Within a project on climate in Europe during the past few hundred years we have collected a record on stable isotope ratios C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 in tree ring cellulose from pine trees in northern Finland. The records cover the time interval 1600-2002 AD and have an annual time resolution. The carbon stable isotope record from northernmost Finland correlates quite strongly with local growth period temperature. Statistical analysis of the carbon and oxygen stable isotope records reveals variations in the periods around 100, 11 and 3 years. A century scale connection between the C-13/C-12 record and solar activity is most evident.

258,"Holocene vegetation and climate history on a continental-oceanic transect in northern Fennoscandia based on pollen and plant macrofossils | Changes in tree-line, mean July temperature (T-jul ) and mean annual precipitation (P-ann ) for the last 10 200 cal. yr BP are reconstructed on the basis of pollen and plant macrofossils preserved in lake sediments from two sites near the present-day tree-line in Troms, northern Norway. Quantitative climate reconstructions are performed using pollen-climate transfer functions based on WA-PLS regression. Early Holocene Betula pubescens forests were gradually replaced by Pinus sylvestris at Dalmutladdo (355 m a.s.l.) starting about 7000 cal. yr BP. The local presence of pine woodland at that time is supported by finds of stomata and plant macrofossils and by high pollen accumulation rates. Until about 4000 cal. yr BP the P. sylvestris tree-line was 250-300 m higher than today, suggesting T-jul about 2.0degreesC higher than at present. The later part of the Holocene has a cooler and moister climate and an increasing development of mires and fern-rich vegetation, as shown by increases of Sphagnum and fern spores and the re-establishment of B. pubescens woodland. The reconstructed T-jul from the two sites shows similar trends to previously published data, with T-jul 1-2degreesC warmer between 9500 cal. yr BP and 2000 cal. yr BP T-jul . Maximum T-jul values occur between 8500 and 4500 cal. yr BP, after which there is a gradual decrease in T-jul. | ['birks', 'bjune', 'seppa'] | ","['birks', 'bjune', 'seppa']",3
259,"Holocene vegetation dynamics and inferred climate changes at Svanavatnet, Mo i Rana, northern Norway | Pollen and plant macrofossil analyses from Svanavatnet in northern Norway provide records of past vegetation and climate in this region from c. 8700 cal.yr BP until the present. Pollen accumulation rates and the presence of plant macrofossils indicate that Betula pubescens (birch) was present from c. 8600 cal.yr BP and Pinus sylvestris (pine) from c. 8200 cal.yr BP. Quantitative climate is reconstructed using modern pollen-climate transfer functions based on weighted-averaging partial least squares regression. A rapid increase in mean July temperature (T-jul) and mean annual precipitation (P-ann) is inferred for the early Holocene. At times when tree abundance is at its highest and most diverse, inferred Tjul indicates maximum temperatures during the mid-Holocene of about 2 degrees C warmer than at present. During the same time period, inferred Pann is 200 - 300mm above present-day conditions until c. 3000 cal.yr BP. Mean January temperatures (T-jan) are reconstructed to be about 2 degrees C warmer than today from 8000 to 3500 cal.yr BP. After 3500 cal.yr BP until today, a gradual decrease is seen in all the reconstructed climate parameters, together with a reduction in tree abundance and the development of a mosaic of open vegetation with grasses, dwarf shrubs and wet areas, and of woodland containing B. pubescens, P. sylvestris and Picea abies (spruce). | ['birks', 'bjune'] | ","['birks', 'bjune']",2
260,"Warmer climate and tree-limit rise in the Swedish Scandes | The paper reviews, summarizes and photographically depicts results from tree-limit monitoring activities (20th century) within a regional network of sites in the southern Swedish Scandes (c. 8000 km2). The emerging trends and tendencies are viewed in perspective of a new 10 000 year chronology of tree-limit (and climate) change in the same area. All the principal tree species growing in the Swedish Scandes, i.e. Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies), have responded to 20th century warming (c. 0.7degreeC) by elevational tree-limit advance amounting to more than 100 m (maximum 165 m). After slight retardation in concert with transiently cooler climate for some decades after 1940, this process has been resumed during the 1990s. Concurrently, young saplings of birch, spruce, pine and rowan have established at exceptionally high elevations, i.e. more than 400 m above their current tree-limits. These most recent developments relate to a series of exceptionally mild winters and some warm summers. Also some low-alpine plant species, e.g. Salix lapponum, S. lanata, S. phylicifolia have advanced upslope similarly to the trees. The magnitude of total 20th century tree-limit rise varies in a topoclimatic context and advance is mainly confined to wind-sheltered and snow-rich segments of the landscape. Thickening of birch tree stands between the old and new tree-limit and also below the former has profoundly altered the general character of the subapline/low alpine landscape and initiated a positive and stabilizing feed-back loop. Concurrent with the recent warm phase, ""exotic"" tree species (Pinus contorta, Pinus cembra/sibirica and Acer platanoides) have occasionally established in the tree-limit zone. Range-limit advances of trees over large elevational distances have occurred without appreciable time-lags, which suggests that vegetational responses to potential future warming may occur swiftly and in fairly close equilibrium with the changing climate. Many of the recent changes accounted for above are consistent with ""traditional ecological knowledge"", i.e. experiences and traditions by older knowledgeable persons in the local population. The new pine tree-limit may be higher, and recent climate correspondingly warmer, than during any other century over the past 4000 years or so. These inferences are relevant with respect to the current concern about the future of the Earth's climate, and the balance of natural and anthropogenic forcings in that context. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],2
261,"White spruce expansion at the tree line and recent climatic change | Picea glauca populations at their N limit of distribution, the tree line along the E coast of Hudson Bay, expanded significantly during the last 100 yr in response to recent climatic warming. Expansion began around 1880 but was more important during the 20th century, especially between 1920-1965. Although no major change in the position of the forest limit and the latitudinal tree line occurred, local altitudinal tree lines rose a few tens of meters. The seed regeneration line increased to about 100 m above the present altitudinal tree line. Tree density increased below the local tree lines at many sites. There, spruce expansion was stepwise, as indicated by widely distributed clustered cohorts. Although the expansion process was stimulated by nearby old seed bearers, long-distance seed dispersal did occur. The development of contagious dispersion during the formation of white spruce groves or forests caused important local ecological changes, particularly in snow patterns and tree growth. Fire selectively influenced tree regeneration during the past centuries. Black spruce P. mariana krummholz were progressively decimated during the last 400 yr BP, although the species was characterized by low postfire regeneration. Vigorous postfire white spruce regeneration was stimulated by favorable climatic conditions 100 yr BP in the northernmost forest site. -from Authors | ['filion', 'payette'] | ","['filion', 'payette']",0
262,"Wood anatomy of Juniperus communis: a promising proxy for palaeoclimate reconstructions in the Arctic | The Arctic is one of the most sensitive areas worldwide with respect to climate changes, and recent climate change impacts are evident throughout Arctic ecosystems. In order to put current and projected changes in a palaeoclimatic context, exact information of past conditions and therefore detailed knowledge of proxy archives are crucial. Here, we investigated wood anatomical and other growth-related records of the long-lived and widespread Arctic tundra shrub Juniperus communis L. Annual ring-widths and cell anatomical parameters of 20 individuals from south-west Greenland were measured to test for age-related trends in the proxy time series and to correlate them with past climatic conditions. We documented a clear age trend in the investigated growth parameters (ring-widths, conduit-lumen areas, and cell wall thicknesses), which indicates the need for detrending the time series prior to possible climate correlation analyses and climate or environmental reconstructions. Prostrate growth forms of J. communis do not exhibit the general trend of an exponential widening of the conduit-lumen areas during ontogeny, as has been observed for many tree species, but their conduit lumens stop to increase in size at some point. This is possibly caused by a combination of extreme climate and physiological adaptations, which result in a prostrate growth form. Of the tested growth parameters, only detrended cell wall thickness showed stable correlations with summer temperature and the summer standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The other growth parameters did not pass cross-calibration verification analyses, although for ring-widths we found the strongest climate correlations. Despite the fact that the ecophysiological processes behind our observations (i.e. reduced cell wall thickness combined with wider rings under dry conditions in the vegetation season) yet are not fully understood, we recognize the potential of J. communis for climate reconstructions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of using cell anatomical parameter of J. communis shrubs as palaeoclimatological proxy for the Arctic. | ['bura', 'lehejcek', 'svoboda', 'wilmking'] | ","['bura', 'lehejcek', 'svoboda', 'wilmking']",0

1,"Activity Areas or Conflict Episode? Interpreting the Spatial Patterning of Lice and Fleas at the Precontact Yup'ik Site of Nunalleq (Sixteenth to Seventeenth Centuries AD, Alaska) | Archaeoentomological research at the precontact site of Nunalleq (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries AD), Southwest Alaska, has identified hundreds of lice and fleas that infested both the human inhabitants of the site and their canine companions. As lice are host specific, staying attached to the host's hair or fur during the totality of their lifecycle, they are generally considered excellent indicators of activity areas. Fleas, however, are relatively less common in archaeological contexts and, since they are mobile and able to infest several different host species, their potential use in the spatial reconstruction of activities is more limited. At Nunalleq, the study of insects from the most recent archaeological contexts produced very different spatial distribution patterns for human lice, fleas, and dog lice. This article compares these archaeoentomological data with other datasets available for the site (carrion-feeding flies, human hair, fur, coprolites, projectile points, and pieces of clothing) with the aim of establishing the phenomena that produced the distinct spatial distributions observed. | ['britton', 'coutouly', 'forbes', 'hillerdal', 'huchet', 'knecht', 'ledger', 'masson', 'maclean', 'masson', 'maclean', 'mcmanus', 'fry'] | ","['britton', 'coutouly', 'forbes', 'hillerdal', 'huchet', 'knecht', 'ledger', 'masson', 'maclean', 'masson', 'maclean', 'mcmanus', 'fry']",1

We found noteworthy genetic similarity between the ancient dog and modern sled dogs. We detected gene flow from Pleistocene Siberian wolves, but not modern American wolves, to present-day sled dogs. The results indicate that the major ancestry of modern sled dogs traces back to Siberia, where sled dog-specific haplotypes of genes that potentially relate to Arctic adaptation were established by 9500 years ago. | ['andersen', 'ranberg', 'bachmann', 'caroe', 'castruita', 'dalen', 'dietz', 'feuerborn', 'frantz', 'fredholm', 'gilbert', 'gopalakrishnan', 'hansen', 'heide', 'jorgensen', 'ivanova', 'jordan', 'kasparov', 'kuderna', 'larson', 'marque', 'bonet', 'meldgaard', 'niemann', 'nikolskiy', 'pavlova', 'petersen', 'pitulko', 'ramos', 'madrigal', 'sicheritz', 'ponten', 'sinding', 'skoglund', 'sonne', 'vieira', 'wennerberg', 'wiig', 'willerslev', 'de', 'manuel'] | ","['andersen', 'ranberg', 'bachmann', 'caroe', 'castruita', 'dalen', 'dietz', 'feuerborn', 'frantz', 'fredholm', 'gilbert', 'gopalakrishnan', 'hansen', 'heide', 'jorgensen', 'ivanova', 'jordan', 'kasparov', 'kuderna', 'larson', 'marque', 'bonet', 'meldgaard', 'niemann', 'nikolskiy', 'pavlova', 'petersen', 'pitulko', 'ramos', 'madrigal', 'sicheritz', 'ponten', 'sinding', 'skoglund', 'sonne', 'vieira', 'wennerberg', 'wiig', 'willerslev', 'de', 'manuel']",1
3,"Aeolian dunes of central Sweden | In the Swedish inland there are aeolian deposits present, ranging from scattered single dunes to dune fields of more than 10 km2. These dune fields often pass unnoticed since they presently are covered by vegetation. However, they contain a rich palaeoenvironmental archive. Only a few research papers have been published regarding these aeolian deposits during the last 90 years. The primary scope of this thesis has been to determine why these dunes formed, when they formed, and what they can tell us about the environment during their formation. The results from these investigations are presented in four research papers. The shape and orientation of a dune is determined by the local environment during its formation, such as the abundance of sediment available for entrainment by the wind, groundwater table fluctuations, changes to precipitation and temperature, presence/absence of vegetation, mode of the wind et cetera. By determining the type of dunes it is possible to determine the local environment during their formation. If one also can determine when these dunes formed and stabilised one can determine the palaeoenvironment, and in extension the palaeoclimate, during a specific time period. In this thesis, new findings are presented regarding the geomorphology, geochronology and palaeoenvironment of a number of dunes and dune fields in south and central Sweden, based on state-of-the-art methods, such as LiDAR (light detection and ranging) based remote sensing and optically stimulated luminescence dating. The previous hypotheses concerning the formation of these dunes have also been evaluated. The findings show that the dunes of central Sweden are primarily of a transverse type, i.e. their dune ridges are transverse to the dune forming winds and they were formed in a setting devoid of vegetation and with an abundance of sediment. The primary dune forming winds for these transverse dunes appear to have been north-westerly and westerly winds. The investigated dunes further to the south show signs of having been reworked after their initial formation and are often of a parabolic type, i.e. curved/crescentic in shape with their arms facing upwind. These dunes have been described as strongly linked to the presence of vegetation, and can often be considered secondary dune forms. These more southern dunes appear to also mainly have been formed by north-westerly and westerly winds, although they display a bigger scatter in wind directions than the more northern dunes. The luminescence ages suggest that most of the dunes formed during the early Holocene, and later events of sand drift have been uncommon with only minor impact on the dune morphology. There seems to have been a primary dune stabilisation phase ~10-9 ka, irrespective of the latitude of the dune fields. This means that some dune fields formed close after local deglaciation, while others formed millennia later. This suggests that dune formation and dune stabilisation of central Sweden have been controlled by regional environmental conditions. Extremely low lake levels in southern and south-central Sweden 10.5-9.5 ka BP in conjunction with an unstable climate during early Holocene probably delayed dune stabilisation by vegetation. After the vegetation had stabilised the dunes, they became much more resilient to further fluctuations in the climate. ¬© 2018, University of Lund.

4,"Age-specific in situ recruitment of female King Eiders estimated with mark-recapture | In addition to estimating survival probability of adult birds, estimating recruitment of new individuals into avian breeding populations is fundamental to understanding rates of population change. Notions about mean recruitment age can lead to erroneous conclusions about population projections if the probability of capture is ignored. We calculated the mean recruitment age of King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis) using two methods: (1) a naive estimate based strictly on observed age at first recapture of marked ducklings as nesting females; and (2) reversed capture histories, which incorporate probability of capture into estimates. From 1996 to 2009, we marked 2,390 King Eider ducklings, 53 of which were recaptured from 2007 to 2010 as females nesting at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, in Canada's Central Arctic region. The naive approach estimated mean (+/- 95% CL) recruitment age as 4.58 +/- 0.42 yr, whereas reversed capture histories estimated mean recruitment age as 4.08 +/- 0.34 yr. We illustrate the influence of recruitment age (range: 3-9 yr) on the predicted annual rate of population change. We fit numerous ecological covariates to test for cohort effects, phenology of vernal thaw, absolute and relative nesting phenology of mothers, maternal body size, density dependence, and relative clutch size on age-specific recruitment probability. There was good support for a negative effect of relative initiation date of nests that produced ducklings, and equivocal support for an additive negative influence of vernal thaw at the age that ducklings were recruited as breeders. We discuss the implications of variation in female recruitment age for King Eider population biology and fitness. More broadly, we reiterate previous advice (e.g., Pradel et al. 1997, Schwarz and Arnason 2000), against calculation of mean recruitment age from age at first capture, regardless of study species, particularly when detection probability of recruits is low. | ['alisauskas', 'kellett'] | ","['alisauskas', 'kellett']",4
5,"Alaska Peninsula Stable Isotope and Radioisotope Chemistry: A Study in Temporal and Adaptive Diversity | Purified bone collagen from a small suite of human remains recovered at three sites on the Alaska Peninsula (Port Moller, Brooks River, and Mink Island) were analyzed for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope chemistry and were accelerator radiocarbon dated. Because samples sizes were small and faunal isotope chemistry lacking, results should be considered preliminary. However, these data indicate that each locality was represented by a somewhat different suite of subsistence strategies and covered a distinct temporal span. Port Moller burials (n = 7) from the Hot Springs site date to a calibrated 2 sigma range of 3547-1388 BP. Although marine foods clearly made the greatest contribution to these diets, individuals were not as heavily reliant on high-trophic-level marine taxa as eastern Aleutian groups to the west, given their intake of salmon and evidence of caribou hunting. Brooks River burials (n = 9) expressed an inland foraging focus with significant reliance on caribou and spawning salmon and covered a calibrated 2s range of 1484-381 BP. In contrast, individuals from Mink Island (n = 7), dating to cal. 666-292 BP, were heavily reliant on high-trophic-level marine prey similar to but not as enriched isotopically as the Aleut, perhaps a consequence of limited access to caribou and greater reliance on invertebrates. This pattern suggests that prehistoric economic strategies on the Alaska Peninsula were diverse, characterized by fine-tuned adaptations to local ecological settings, perhaps mediated by ethnic factors and territorial and social pressures. | ['coltrain'] | ",['coltrain'],4
6,"Alaskan USA Megabucks Megabulls and Megarams the Issue of Pleistocene Gigantism | Pleistocene large mammals from Alaska appear to be larger than their living counterparts. This seems to be the case for cervids (Rangifer, Cervus and Alces) and bovids (Ovis, Ovibos and Bison). The circumstances of this larger body size are examined. The primary reason behind such large bodied, large horned or antlered, individuals was 2-fold. They belonged to populations which were kept understocked by high winter mortality and experienced a long peak in nutrient availability during the growth season. The length of this seasonal peak in nutrient availability is seen as critical to studies of body size changes. Wild sheep are used as an exemplary case and are examined in greater detail than other species. Large non-ruminant ungulates seem to respond differential than ruminants to the changing conditions from mid-Pleistocene, to late Pleistocene, through the Holocene. This may be due to their more conservative life histories. Pleistocene ground squirrels (Spermophilus) in Alaska seem to have responded differently than ungulates in their body size changes. Their special life history features, particularly hibernation and reproduction may account for this difference. | ['guthrie'] | ",['guthrie'],0
7,"Aleutian Island Albatrosses Alaska USA a Population History | Three species of albatross have frequented seas near the Aleutian Islands [Alaska, USA] during the Holocene: the short-tailed albatross (Diomedea albatrus), black-footed albatross (D. nigripes), and Laysan albatross (D. immutabilis). Archaeological data from several site excavations on SW Umnak Island in the Aleutians demonstrate that albatrosses were a major contributor to the avian portion of the prehistoric Aleut diet. As a large and seasonally reliable resource, they were probably particularly important in times of dietary stress. The abundance of albatross remains in archaeological sites, lack of very young individuals, intersite homogeneity of albatross frequencies, and correlation between albatross and shearwater frequencies suggest that albatrosses were hunted at sea, in all probability where they congregated in nutrient-rich upwelling waters in interisland passes, and while following boats engaged in other hunting activities. Most of the albatross remains recovered were of short-tailed albatrosses, probably indicating the great abundance and near island distribution of this species. Black-footed albatross remains were fewer in number and scattered throughout the middens, probably reflecting the generally more southerly occurrence of this species, and possible competitive exclusion by short-tailed albatrosses. Laysan albatross remains were restricted to the upper levels of all sites, possibly indicating that increased reports of this bird are due to expansion into the niche formerly occupied by the short-tailed albatross. | ['yesner'] | ",['yesner'],4

11,"Ancient Alas Complexes of Northern Yakutia (part 2) | The ancient buried Alas Complex in cross-sections of the high Yedoma level on the shores of the Dmitri Laptev Strait is described. This Complex is compared to earlier described Alas Complexes in cross-sections of Duvanny Yar on Kolyma and Achchagyi-Allaikha on the left bank of the Indigirka river. The ancient Alas Complexes possess common structural features. The taberal formations are commonly found at the base of the sections while the alas accumulations occur in the upper part of Alas Complexes. Systems of pseudomorphs of ice wedges are commonly found along the boundaries of these formations. Thus, the structure of the ancient Alas Complexes is similar to the structure of the Holocene Alas Complexes. The ancient Alas Complexes as well as the Holocene Ice Complexes have resulted from the lake thermokarst followed by sedimentation in the alases. In all considered cases the emergence of the ancient Alas Complexes was associated with dramatic environmental changes indicated by the transformation of vegetation from tundra-steppe into humid tundra and even into taiga. This environmental transformation was primarily caused both by some temperature rise and by replacement of a regime of insufficient precipitation by one of excessive humidity. The question of the age of the reviewed ancient Alas Complexes cannot be considered resolved. The most likely intervals of Alas formation and accumulation of deposits in these Alases are the early-karginsky (MIS-3, Duvannyi Yar) and the kazantsevsky (MIS-5, Allaikha and the Dmitri Laptev Strait). | ['kaplina'] | ",['kaplina'],4
12,"Ancient depictions of reindeer enclosures and their environment | Enclosures and fences for hunting reindeer are depicted in Late Mesolithic rock art in Alta, northernmost Norway. This technique of hunting is known from the area in the ethnohistoric records, although the extent to which these records represent prehistoric practises and societies is uncertain. Common for both is the topography, through which people and reindeer moved, while climatic differences meant that vegetation zones were slightly displaced and the shore area would have been smaller as the sea level was higher than today due to the Holocene shore-displacement. Other common features are the behaviour, seasonal movements and the physical features of the reindeer. The depictions and their integration with the rock surface is a micro landscape that reflects the hunt and environment as well as other meanings in narratives, cosmology and rituals. The attributes of the reindeer and the presence of bears and other animals indicate that the compositions are as much associated with rituals and cosmology as the hunts themselves. | ['helskog'] | ",['helskog'],1
13,"Ancient DNA identifies post-glacial recolonisation, not recent bottlenecks, as the primary driver of contemporary mtDNA phylogeography and diversity in Scandinavian brown bears | Aim Brown bear populations in Scandinavia show a strong mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeographic structure and low diversity relative to other parts of Europe. Identifying the timing and origins of this mtDNA structure is important for conservation programs aimed at restoring populations to a natural state. Therefore, it is essential to identify whether contemporary genetic structure is linked to post-glacial recolonisation from divergent source populations or an artefact of demographic impacts during recent population bottlenecks. We employed ancient DNA techniques to investigate the timing and potential causes of these patterns. Location Scandinavia and Europe. Methods Ancient mtDNA sequences from 20 post-glacial Scandinavian bears were used to investigate phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity over the last 6000years. MtDNA from 19 Holocene Norwegian bears was compared with 499 sequences from proximate extant populations in Sweden, Finland, Estonia and western Russia. A single mtDNA sequence from a Holocene Denmark sample was compared with 149 ancient and modern bears from Western Europe. Results All nineteen Holocene Norwegian samples are identical to or closely related to the most common mtDNA haplotype found in northern Europe today. MtDNA diversity was low and not significantly different from extant populations in northern Europe. In Denmark, we identified a single mtDNA haplotype that is previously unrecorded from Scandinavia. Main conclusions The current discrete phylogeographic structure and lack of mtDNA diversity in Scandinavia is attributed to serial founder effects during post-glacial recolonisation from divergent source populations rather than an artefact of recent anthropogenic impacts. In contrast to previous interpretations, the recolonisation of southern Scandinavia may not have been limited to bears from a single glacial refugium. Results highlight the importance of conserving the long-term evolutionary separation between northern and southern populations and identify southern Scandinavia as an important reservoir of mtDNA diversity that is under threat in other parts of Europe. | ['aaris', 'sorensen', 'adler', 'austin', 'bray', 'cooper', 'lauritzen', 'metcalf', 'ostbye', 'ostbye', 'valdiosera'] | ","['aaris', 'sorensen', 'adler', 'austin', 'bray', 'cooper', 'lauritzen', 'metcalf', 'ostbye', 'ostbye', 'valdiosera']",1
14,"Ancient DNA reveals the chronology of walrus ivory trade from Norse Greenland | The importance of the Atlantic walrus ivory trade for the colonization, peak, and collapse of the medieval Norse colonies on Greenland has been extensively debated. Nevertheless, no studies have directly traced medieval European ivory back to distinct Arctic populations of walrus. Analysing the entire mitogenomes of 37 archaeological specimens from Europe, Svalbard, and Greenland, we here discover that Atlantic walrus comprises two monophyletic mitochondrial (MT) clades, which diverged between 23 400 and 251 120 years ago. Our improved genomic resolution allows us to reinterpret the geographical distribution of partial MT data from 306 modern and nineteenth-century specimens, finding that one of these clades was exclusively accessible to Greenlanders. With this discovery, we ascertain the biological origin of 23 archaeological specimens from Europe (most dated between 900 and 1400 CE). These results reveal a significant shift in trade from an early, predominantly eastern source towards a near exclusive representation of Greenland ivory. Our study provides empirical evidence for how this remote Arctic resource was progressively integrated into a medieval pan-European trade network, contributing to both the resilience and vulnerability of Norse Greenland society. | ['barrett', 'boessenkool', 'gondek', 'star'] | ","['barrett', 'boessenkool', 'gondek', 'star']",0
15,"Ancient DNA sequences point to a large loss of mitochondrial genetic diversity in the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) since the Pleistocene | Prior to the Holocene, the range of the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) spanned from France to the Northwest Territories of Canada. Although its distribution subsequently contracted to the steppes of Central Asia, historical records indicate that it remained extremely abundant until the end of the Soviet Union, after which its populations were reduced by over 95%. We have analysed the mitochondrial control region sequence variation of 27 ancient and 38 modern specimens, to assay how the species' genetic diversity has changed since the Pleistocene. Phylogenetic analyses reveal the existence of two well-supported, and clearly distinct, clades of saiga. The first, spanning a time range from >49 500 C-14 ybp to the present, comprises all the modern specimens and ancient samples from the Northern Urals, Middle Urals and Northeast Yakutia. The second clade is exclusive to the Northern Urals and includes samples dating from between 40 400 to 10 250 C-14 ybp. Current genetic diversity is much lower than that present during the Pleistocene, an observation that data modelling using serial coalescent indicates cannot be explained by genetic drift in a population of constant size. Approximate Bayesian Computation analyses show the observed data is more compatible with a drastic population size reduction (c. 66-77%) following either a demographic bottleneck in the course of the Holocene or late Pleistocene, or a geographic fragmentation (followed by local extinction of one subpopulation) at the Holocene/Pleistocene transition. | ['baryshnikov', 'campos', 'drucker', 'gilbert', 'gotherstrom', 'hofreiter', 'kholodova', 'kosintsev', 'kristensen', 'orlando', 'sher', 'tikhonov', 'willerslev'] | ","['baryshnikov', 'campos', 'drucker', 'gilbert', 'gotherstrom', 'hofreiter', 'kholodova', 'kosintsev', 'kristensen', 'orlando', 'sher', 'tikhonov', 'willerslev']",1
16,"Ancient latitudinal gradients of C3/C4 grasses interpreted from stable isotopes of New World Pleistocene horse (Equus) teeth | Carbon and oxygen isotopic data are reported from 116 Pleistocene Equus teeth from sixty-six localities in the New World ranging from 68degreeN (Alaska, Canada) to 35degreeS (Argentina). Equus species have been predominantly grazers, and as such, carbon isotopic values of their tooth enamel provide evidence of the Pleistocene distribution of C3 and C4 grasses. The carbon data presented here indicate a gradient (delta13C range of 10 parts/mil) in the relative proportion of C3 and C4 grasses between high latitude and equatorial Equus samples. The largest amount of change from C3 to C4 grasses during the Pleistocene occurred in the mid-latitudes between about 30 to 40degree. The oxygen data, which vary proportionately with temperature, indicate a latitudinal gradient (delta18O range of 20 parts/mil) between high-latitude and equatorial Equus samples. The basic pattern of latitudinal gradients of C3/C4 grass distribution and temperature as interpreted from these Pleistocene data is similar to the modern-day. The use of stable isotopes of fossil herbivore teeth represents a new means to interpret Pleistocene climates and terrestrial ecology. | ['cerling', 'harris', 'macfadden', 'prado'] | ","['cerling', 'harris', 'macfadden', 'prado']",1
17,"Ancient and modern environmental DNA | DNA obtained from environmental samples such as sediments, ice or water (environmental DNA, eDNA), represents an important source of information on past and present biodiversity. It has revealed an ancient forest in Greenland, extended by several thousand years the survival dates for mainland woolly mammoth in Alaska, and pushed back the dates for spruce survival in Scandinavian ice-free refugia during the last glaciation. More recently, eDNA was used to uncover the past 50 000 years of vegetation history in the Arctic, revealing massive vegetation turnover at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition, with implications for the extinction of megafauna. Furthermore, eDNA can reflect the biodiversity of extant flora and fauna, both qualitatively and quantitatively, allowing detection of rare species. As such, trace studies of plant and vertebrate DNAin the environment have revolutionized our knowledge of biogeography. However, the approach remains marred by biases related toDNAbehaviour in environmental settings, incomplete reference databases and false positive results due to contamination.We provide a review of the field. ¬© 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

18,"Andrei Sher and Quaternary science | Andrei Sher (1939-2008) was a key individual in Beringian studies who made substantial and original contributions, but also, importantly, built bridges between western and eastern Beringian scientists spanning some five decades of research. He is perhaps best known as a Quaternary palaeontologist, specializing in large mammals, and mammoths in particular, but his field of his scientific research was much broader, encompassing Quaternary geology, stratigraphy, geocryology, and paleoenvironmental reconstructions. He worked mainly in Siberia, in the Kolyma and Indigirka lowlands, and Chukotka, but also completed fieldwork in Alaska and Yukon through joint projects with American and Canadian scientists. Andrei was an active scientist until the last days of his life. He was involved in many different research projects ranging from mammoth evolution, fossil insects and environmental changes and ancient DNA. Without Andrei's connections between researchers, many unique discoveries would likely be unknown. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

19,"THE ANDRE–ïVSKOYE LAKE SYSTEM AT THE TURN OF THE BRONZE AND EARLY IRON AGES: PALEO-LANDSCAPE MAPPING, BIOPRODUCTIVITY ASSESSMENT AND DEMOGRAPHIC CAPACITY OF THE TERRITORY (TURA and PYSHMA interfluve, west siberia) | On the basis of complex paleogeographic studies, we have created a large-scale paleo-landscape map covering the territory of the Andreevskoye lake flow system, in-between the Tura and the Pyshma rivers (West Siberia), for the interval of 2850-2600 cal. BP. According to the mapping results, the areas of key vegetation types were determined. By selecting modern analogues, we calculated the ecological capacity of the territory, as well as its biological productivity potential for providing plant and animal resources. In the past, spatio-temporal changes in the share of the main plant communities were based on the degree of area drainage varying with different climatic conditions. As a result of palynological and geochemical studies, a trend towards increasing humidity and falling temperature was identified in the given chronological interval. In this regard, the map shows a large proportion of birch forests and damp meadows, whereas coniferous forests and swamps were less dominant in the landscapes as compared to present times. In 2850-2600 cal. BP, the territory of the Andreevskoye lake system was developed by the representatives of the Itkul culture. On the basis of data on the natural resources available in the territory, the bioproductivity potential for producing and appropriating economy was calculated. The calculations are based on historical and ethnographic analogies and take into account the fact that producing industries used only 20-22 % of the territory's resource base. Evidently, the greatest amount of food was provided by fishing rather than by hunting and producing industries. Fishing was of paramount importance, as evidenced by the location of settlements (mainly on the lake shores). Reconstructed data on the territory's resource supply, allowed us to determine a possible size of the Itkul population having lived in the territory of the Andreevskoye lake system. The calculations used the data on the energy value of various products, taking energy consumption of people involved in vigorous physical activity into account. In the given chronological interval of 2850-2600 cal. BP, local resources allowed for the possibility of simultaneous residence of about 280-373 people. The indicator of resource availability in the territory allows the paleodemographic calculations to be significantly adjusted using methods for estimating a dwelling area, since they determine the population density limit, provided the land is used simultaneously. The figures obtained for the number of Itkul population correspond only to the minimum values, calculated by taking the area and number of dwellings of this culture into account. –ù–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–∞–ª–µ–æ–≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∞ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–æ–º–∞—Å—à—Ç–∞–±–Ω–∞—è –ø–∞–ª–µ–æ–ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –æ–∑–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –≤ –º–µ–∂–¥—É—Ä–µ—á—å–µ –¢—É—Ä—ã –∏ –ü—ã—à–º—ã (–ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è –°–∏–±–∏—Ä—å) –¥–ª—è –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤–∞–ª–∞ 2850-2600 –∫–∞–ª. –ª.–Ω. –ü–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–º —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–µ–π –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤—ã—Ö —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≤ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—ã —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –µ–º–∫–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –∏ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª –±–∏–æ–ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—è—â–µ–º –∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Å–≤–∞–∏–≤–∞—é—â–µ–º —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ. –ò—Å—Ö–æ–¥—è –∏–∑ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å–æ–æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –æ–± —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–µ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞, –æ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã –∏ —Ä—ã–±–æ–ª–æ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–∞—è —á–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–∑–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –≤ –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–º —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤–∞–ª–µ. –í —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –æ—Å–≤–∞–∏–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–∞–º–∏ –∏—Ç–∫—É–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏—Ç—å –µ–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 280-373 —á–µ–ª., —É—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞—è, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—è—â–∏–µ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞—Å–ª–∏ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –ª–∏—à—å 20-22 % —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å–Ω–æ–π –±–∞–∑—ã. –≠—Ç–∞ —á–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Å–æ–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è —Å –º–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—ã –ø–æ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º –æ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ –∏ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∂–∏–ª–∏—â –Ω–∞ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â–∞—Ö –∏—Ç–∫—É–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã. –ü–æ-–≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ–º—É, –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–µ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–µ –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—è—â–∏–µ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞—Å–ª–∏, –∞ –¥–æ–±—ã—á–∞ —Ä—ã–±—ã - —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ, –æ —á–µ–º —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–µ–∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–∞ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞—Ö –æ–∑–µ—Ä. | [] | ",,4
20,"Animals and humans in the European Russian Arctic towards the end of the last Ice Age and during the mid-Holocene time | Here, we present and discuss results from geo-archaeological and palaeo-zoological investigations at the Palaeolithic site Pymva Shor, in the Russian Arctic. As many as 3324 vertebrate fauna remains were recovered during two excavations. This includes bones of mammals, birds and fish. Radiocarbon dates were obtained from 26 specimens. The results show ages in the range 30-3cal. ka BP. Hare and reindeer are the best represented amongst the identified mammalian species, whilst ptarmigan and various wader species dominate the avian bones. The Pleistocene assemblage includes herbivorous herd animals such as horse, bison and musk ox. These species are typical of the treeless tundra-steppe landscape that existed during the Lateglacial. Of particular interest is a cave lion specimen that has been radiocarbon dated to approximately 15.5cal. ka BP. According to our knowledge, this is one of the latest dated examples of this species in Eurasia. The faunal composition in the Holocene assemblage is strikingly different and includes distinct forest taxa such as beaver and pine marten. The avifauna also supports a forested environment with the presence of black grouse. A few stone artefacts were found within the strata, and have been radiocarbon dated to 16-15cal. ka BP, suggesting that there were humans in the Pymva Shore area at that time. We identified impact notches and cut marks on some radiocarbon-dated reindeer and bison bones, showing that humans were present twice during the Younger Dryas period. A fourth occupation phase is identified during the mid-Holocene (6-5cal. ka BP). We also investigated river terraces and obtained a series of luminescence dates. These have been used to reconstruct the geological history and the relationship to the find-bearing strata. | ['hufthammer', 'pavlov', 'svendsen'] | ","['hufthammer', 'pavlov', 'svendsen']",4

Prior study addressed precontact sea otter teeth from Oregon and found they were not significantly different in absolute size from modern California sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) teeth, and smaller than modern Alaska sea otter (Enhydra lutrir lutris) teeth. These geographic groupings were later confirmed by an ancient DNA study. The conclusion that distinct geographic populations exist based on tooth size was founded on small samples.

30,"Archaeological dogs from the Early Holocene Zhokhov site in the Eastern Siberian Arctic | Excavations on the Zhokhov Island yielded a small but meaningful collection of Early Holocene canine faunal remains (MNI = 13). To clarify the morphological characteristics of the Zhokhov dogs' skulls, they were compared to the modern skulls of the Eastern Siberian wolves. This analysis shows, that around 9000 years ago a fully formed, as a species, domesticated dog was present at the Zhokhov site and used by the inhabitants of the area while hunting and as a draft animal. Presence of a developed form of dog sledding has been securely established for this culture. The Zhokhov site osteological dog remains analysis showed that the comparison of two proportional ratios (the ratio of skull height in the cranial region to total skull length and the ratio of snout height at Pm1 - Pm2 to total skull length) is a universal and reliable criterion for distinguishing wolf skulls from wolf-like dog skulls. This method prevents the influence of any single measurement on the identification of any individual as a dog or a wolf. We propose to name them indices DD1 and DD2, accordingly (for Dog Domestication). We also show that a sled dog and hunting dog standard existed, which significantly changes the current ideas about the timing of specialized dog breed formation via directed selection. Full completion of this process marks the third stage of domestication. Two earlier stages precede it in time and space (natural selection via the feeding behavior within specific ecological niche, formed by the human activity, followed by artificial selection based on the animal's ability to be tamed). We suggest that sled dogs could have been used in Siberia around 15,000 years ago. | ['kasparov', 'pitulko'] | ","['kasparov', 'pitulko']",4
31,"The archaeological record of domesticated and tamed birds in Sweden | This paper summarizes information on domesticated birds in Sweden up to the end of the Middle Ages. It is based on data from subfossil remains but also incorporates information from art and early written sources. The most important domestic bird in Sweden has always been the Domestic Fowl. It was probably introduced to Sweden during the Pre-Roman Iron Age and by the Migration period it had become common and spread as far north as Jamtland. During the Late Iron Age and the Middle Ages remains of Domestic Fowl are very common throughout the farming areas of southern and central Sweden. The only other common domestic bird was Domestic Goose. When this was first kept in Sweden is uncertain since Greylag Geese occur naturally in the area but it was probably introduced (or domesticated locally?) at approximately the same time as the Fowl. It is difficult to determine when domestic Duck was introduced, or how common it was since remains of wild Ducks are also common, but it seems that domesticated Ducks were of minor importance in Sweden. There is no definite proof that Pigeons were kept in Sweden until post-medieval times. Turkeys seem to have reached Sweden remarkably quickly and were apparently well established by the end of the sixteenth century. Falconry was probably introduced during the sixth century AD and, judging from remains in graves, it was widespread in aristocratic circles at least in Eastern Sweden up to the end of the Iron Age. The predominant species was Goshawk. An interesting aspect of the ""falconry graves"" is the frequent occurrence of Eagle Owls, almost certainly used as decoys to attract birds. Both literary and archaeological sources on Medieval falconry are sparse and it is uncertain how widespread it was, but it seems likely that it was less common than during the Late Iron Age. | ['tyrberg'] | ",['tyrberg'],4

The hunting of sea mammals, especially the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and the grey seal (Halichoerus grvpus), was a significant aspect of this adaptation. Evidence suggests that people hunted seals when the animals were hauled out on intertidal ledges, during their breeding, pupping, and moulting seasons: spring/summer for harbour seals and mid-December-early spring for grey seals. Stratigraphic, culture-historical, zooarchaeological, and paleodietary information suggest that the hunting of sea mammals peaked during the Middle Maritime Woodland and earlier Late Maritime Woodland periods (2260-930 cal B.P.). | ['black'] | ",['black'],4

Based on comparisons with surveys completed in Eastern Inglefield Land (Darwent et al., 2007), the density of features in Foulke Fjord substantially exceeded those from other regions of Inglefield Land. The most parsimonious explanation for the higher occurrence of features in this region is the presence of little auk colonies on the scree slopes of the inner fjords. These birds, which roost in the millions, served as a reliable summer food source, but their feces likely provided enrichment for the local ecosystem, increasing the numbers of terrestrial and marine fauna in the region. Based on excavations at Iita (Etah) and densities of features in the fjord, Foulke Fjord appears to have been continually occupied throughout the Thule-historic period (A. D. 1250-1953), and during the previous Late Dorset period (ca. A.D. 800-1250). However, features associated with the early Paleoeskimo period (2500-500 B. C.) are located only at the outer margins of the fjord. | ['darwent', 'johansen'] | ","['darwent', 'johansen']",4
36,"Arctic archaeological sites threatened by climate change: A regional multi-threat assessment of sites in south-west Greenland | Climate change threatens many well-preserved archaeological sites in the Arctic. The paper presents the first Arctic multi-threat assessment focusing on the Nuuk region of Greenland. The results suggest that the majority of the 336 known archaeological sites are already exposed to impacts from microbial degradation, permafrost thaw and vegetation, and that these impacts will increase over the next 80 years. Additional impacts from coastal erosion are only noted at a limited number of sites due to a predominant consolidated and uplifting coast. The applied methods represent an important first step to identify threatened sites and emphasize important data limitations. ¬© 2020 University of Oxford | ['elberling', 'fenger', 'nielsen', 'harmsen', 'hollesen', 'kroon', 'madsen', 'matthiesen', 'stendel', 'westergaard', 'nielsen'] | ","['elberling', 'fenger', 'nielsen', 'harmsen', 'hollesen', 'kroon', 'madsen', 'matthiesen', 'stendel', 'westergaard', 'nielsen']",1
37,"The Archaeology and Ethnohistory of Walrus Ritual around Bering Strait | Nineteenth-century ethnohistoric sources describe rituals and beliefs related to the exploitation of walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) on the islands of the Bering Sea and the coast of Chukotka. These small-scale rites practiced by St. Lawrence Islanders, Siberian Yupiget, and Chukchi were intended to thank walrus and ensure future hunting success. Rituals conducted by walrus boat captains also facilitated integration of walrus hunting crews and their families. Archaeological evidence for the antiquity of walrus-related ritual is provided by concentrations of walrus skulls in structures and deposition of walrus bones in cemeteries. The centrality of walrus to subsistence, material culture, and ritual life of coastal peoples deserves more scholarly attention in both archaeological and historical reconstructions of Yupik and Chukchi multispecies pasts. | ['hill'] | ",['hill'],4
38,"The archaeology of the Plateau of northwestern North America during the late prehistoric period(3500-200 B. P.): Evolution of hunting and gathering societies | The Plateau of northwestern North America offers one of the world's most important records of hunter gatherer cultural diversity and evolutionary process. During the late prehistoric period, Plateau htinter-gatherer participated in a wide variety of mobile and sedentary mobility regimes, maintained diets emphasizing anadromous fish, roots, and larger game animals, and held patterns of social organization spanning egalitarian through ranked societies. In this paper, we provide a broad overview of the final 3500 years of human occupation on the Plateau that includes two primary goals. First, we provide a new chronology of late prehistoric cultural change and stability that integrates data from the Northern or Canadian Plateau and the Southern or Columbia Plateau. Second, we offer new ideas concerning the emergence, dispersal, and diversification of Plateau hunting and gathering societies. We close with recommendations for Plateau archaeology in the 21st century. | ['chatter', 'clarke', 'lenert', 'oboyle', 'prentiss'] | ","['chatter', 'clarke', 'lenert', 'oboyle', 'prentiss']",1
39,"Archaeozoological Studies at Konoplyanka, the Southern Trans-Urals | Konoplyanka is a fortified settlement associated with the Sintashta culture and dating to 1920-1745 cal BC. The faunal sample was studied with regard to standard traits and markers of pathology, rather recently adopted in Russian archaeozoological studies. The results are relevant not only to herd composition and age at slaughter but also to the animals' state of health. The analysis of pathologies provides information about the herders' skills and the housing of domestic ungulates. Ethnographic data relating to the modern grazing management system in the same area and information received from herdsmen were widely used. This makes it possible to assess the carrying capacity of the land and to arrive at a more accurate reconstruction of the pastoral economy. Markers of osteophagy among the domestic ungulates are analyzed and the phenomenon is discussed in the context of settlement archaeology. The study showed that animal husbandry was the predominant subsistence strategy. Markers of animal pathology indicate a high level of herding skills. The cattle were used as draught animals. Osteophagy attests to places where animals were kept. The predominant system was homestead herding, all or most animals being likely kept within the settlement throughout the year. –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–∞—à—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–µ –∏ –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è 1920-1745 –≥–≥. –¥–æ –Ω.—ç. –ü—Ä–∏ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–æ–≤ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –∫–∞–∫ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–∑–æ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏–∫–∏, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π –¥–ª—è —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç –ø–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑. –¢–∞–∫–æ–π –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è–µ—Ç –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤—å—è —Å–∫–æ—Ç–∞, –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ –∑–∞–±–∏—Ç—ã—Ö –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö, –Ω–æ –∏ –æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–∏ –∏—Ö –∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—å—è. –ò–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–π –¥–∞–µ—Ç –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–≤—ã–∫–æ–≤ –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω–∏—Ö –∫–æ–ø—ã—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö. –í —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–ª–µ–∫–∞—é—Ç—Å—è —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–∑–æ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ - —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –Ω–∞–±–ª—é–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–æ–π –≤—ã–ø–∞—Å–∞ –∏ –æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∞ –ø–∞—Å—Ç—É—Ö–æ–≤ –≤ —Ç–æ–π –∂–µ –º–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –ø–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫. –≠—Ç–æ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è–µ—Ç –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ –≤–º–µ—â–∞—é—â–∏—Ö –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è—Ö –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–∞ –∏ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—é —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ–π. –í —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–µ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ—Å—Ç–µ–æ—Ñ–∞–≥–∏—è —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω–∏—Ö –∫–æ–ø—ã—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–∞ –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–∞ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ —è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–µ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏. –ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–æ, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª–∞ –¥–æ–º–∏–Ω–∏—Ä—É—é—â—É—é —Ä–æ–ª—å –≤ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–µ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–µ–æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –ø–∞—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –¥–∞—é—Ç –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –æ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–º —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞–≤—ã–∫–æ–≤ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–≥–∞—Ç–æ–≥–æ —Å–∫–æ—Ç–∞ –¥–ª—è —Ñ–∏–∑–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã. –°–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–µ–æ—Ñ–∞–≥–∏–∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–∏ –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω–∏—Ö –∫–æ–ø—ã—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è—é—Ç –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö. –§–æ—Ä–º–∞ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–∏–¥–æ–º–Ω–∞—è —Å –≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–Ω—ã–º –∫—Ä—É–≥–ª–æ–≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω—ã–º —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –∏–ª–∏ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤—å—è –Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏. | ['rassadnikov'] | ",['rassadnikov'],3
40,"Assessing the reliability of pRIA for identifying ancient proteins from archaeological contexts | The use of immunological techniques for identifying the origin of proteins and inferring foodstuffs exploited by prehistoric occupations has been conducted for several decades. Cases of experimental laboratory and archaeological studies have shown the potential of these techniques for reliable results. However, very few of these case studies employ archaeological sites that have excellent preservation and high-resolution spatial contexts between identifiable faunal remains, features, and stone tools. We present an assessment of the identification reliability of one immunological technique, protein radioimmunoassay (pRIA), using faunal remains and stone tools from two sites from arctic and subarctic contexts. The results of this research indicate that, even in contexts with excellent preservation, the identifications produced by the pRIA technique are subject to misidentification and cross-reactions due to diagenetic alteration of proteins We propose a higher minimum reaction value (percent binding of labeled antibody) that mitigates these effects, and renders the pRIA results more reliable for ancient, poorly preserved organic remains.

41,"Assessments of the current state of the peatlands prospective areas for their wise use in Tomsk region | Peat is a promising raw material for a variety of economic sectors and also it is characterized by large supplies within our country. Currently, however, peat is extracted only in the regions of the European territory of Russia, for Western Siberia is a future prospect. Therefore the purpose of this work is to assess the present state of the promising areas for peat deposits development of the Western Siberia (for example of the Tomsk region) and to choose ways of their further use. The paper contains studying fund materials and analyzing the current state of peat resources by conducting field descriptions of eight drained and prepared to extraction peat deposits, sampling and analyzing peat ash content, moisture content, degree of decomposition, botanical composition of the peat. According to the results of comparative analysis of fund materials and field descriptions decrease of humidity in peat deposits at 2-23% on almost all sampling points is observed, as well as a slight increase in the ash content of the peat at 1-11%, and in some cases, the degree of decomposition of the upper horizons of the peat deposits on 6-27% over the last 30-40 years under the influence of drying. Peat deposit of investigated formations is characterized by high heterogeneity and patchiness in the territories and, as a result, there is a discrepancy in kinds and types of peat and peat deposits thickness within the sampling sites in comparison with the fund materials. Thus, the development of peat deposits in the long term requires more detailed studies. In addition, during the development of peat deposits it is necessary to conduct clearing and reconstruction of drainage channels, the reduction of tree and shrub vegetation, to pave the roads to peat deposits, and within it. –¢–æ—Ä—Ñ - –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–µ —Å—ã—Ä—å–µ –¥–ª—è —Ä—è–¥–∞ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞—Å–ª–µ–π —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏–∫–∏ –∏ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö –Ω–∞—à–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–º–∏ –∑–∞–ø–∞—Å–∞–º–∏. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–æ–±—ã—á–∞ –≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–∞ –µ–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. –¶–µ–ª—å –Ω–∞—à–µ–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã - –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–∞ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–ª—è –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–≤ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏ (–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä–µ –¢–æ–º—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏) –∏ –æ–±–æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏—Ö–¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–≥–æ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. –í —Ä–∞–º–∫–∞—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω—ã —Ñ–æ–Ω–¥–æ–≤—ã–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω—ã –ø–æ–ª–µ–≤—ã–µ –æ–±—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ—Å—å–º–∏ –æ—Å—É—à–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –ø–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∫ –¥–æ–±—ã—á–µ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π —Å –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–æ–º –∏ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–º –ø—Ä–æ–± —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ–∞ –Ω–∞ –∑–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å, –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å, —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω—å —Ä–∞–∑–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤. –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —Å–Ω–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–ª–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–æ–π –∑–∞–ª–µ–∂–∏ –Ω–∞ 2-23% –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –≤–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ö –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞—Ö –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–±, –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∑–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ–∞ –Ω–∞ 1-11%, –∏ –≤ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–ª—É—á–∞—è—Ö —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–∏—Ö –≥–æ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ –∑–∞–ª–µ–∂–∏ –Ω–∞ 6-27% –∑–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–µ 30-40 –ª–µ—Ç –ø–æ–¥ –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ–º –æ—Å—É—à–µ–Ω–∏—è. –¢–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∞—è –∑–∞–ª–µ–∂—å –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ–º—ã—Ö –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–π –Ω–µ–æ–¥–Ω–æ—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∏ –º–æ–∑–∞–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –ø–æ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è–º, –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ —á–µ–≥–æ –∑–∞—á–∞—Å—Ç—É—é –æ—Ç–º–µ—á–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –∏ —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≤ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ–∞, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –º–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∑–∞–ª–µ–∂–∏ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–±. –í —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–µ –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏. –ö—Ä–æ–º–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –ø—Ä–∏ –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—á–∏—Å—Ç–∫—É –∏ —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—é –æ—Å—É—à–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≤, —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π –∏ –∫—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–æ–π —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –æ–±–æ—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥ –∫–∞–∫ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–µ–≥–∞—é—â–µ–π –∫ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—é —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –≤ –µ–≥–æ –æ–∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è—Ö. | ['belenko', 'gashkova', 'kharanzhevskaya', 'maloletko', 'sinyutkina'] | ","['belenko', 'gashkova', 'kharanzhevskaya', 'maloletko', 'sinyutkina']",3
42,"Assessment of the Extirpated Maritimes Walrus Using Morphological and Ancient DNA Analysis | Species biogeography is a result of complex events and factors associated with climate change, ecological interactions, anthropogenic impacts, physical geography, and evolution. To understand the contemporary biogeography of a species, it is necessary to understand its history. Specimens from areas of localized extinction are important, as extirpation of species from these areas may represent the loss of unique adaptations and a distinctive evolutionary trajectory. The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) has a discontinuous circumpolar distribution in the arctic and subarctic that once included the southeastern Canadian Maritimes region. However, exploitation of the Maritimes population during the 16th-18th centuries led to extirpation, and the species has not inhabited areas south of 55 degrees N for similar to 250 years. We examined genetic and morphological characteristics of specimens from the Maritimes, Atlantic (O. r. rosmarus) and Pacific (O. r. divergens) populations to test the hypothesis that the first group was distinctive. Analysis of Atlantic and Maritimes specimens indicated that most skull and mandibular measurements were significantly different between the Maritimes and Atlantic groups and discriminant analysis of principal components confirmed them as distinctive groups, with complete isolation of skull features. The Maritimes walrus appear to have been larger animals, with larger and more robust tusks, skulls and mandibles. The mtDNA control region haplotypes identified in Maritimes specimens were unique to the region and a greater average number of nucleotide differences were found between the regions (Atlantic and Maritimes) than within either group. Levels of diversity (h and p) were lower in the Maritimes, consistent with other studies of species at range margins. Our data suggest that the Maritimes walrus was a morphologically and genetically distinctive group that was on a different evolutionary path from other walrus found in the north Atlantic. | ['frasier', 'lucas', 'mcleod'] | ","['frasier', 'lucas', 'mcleod']",1
43,"Species assignment in Pupilla (Gastropoda: Pulmonata: Pupillidae): integration of DNA-sequence data and conchology | Using the Pupilla faunas of Europe, North America, the Altai region of central Asia and eastern Asia, we consider whether the existing taxonomy based primarily on shell apertural characteristics correlates with relationships established on the basis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA-sequence data. We obtained DNA sequence from nuclear ITS1 and ITS2 and mitochondrial COI and CytB from 80 specimens across 22 putative Pupilla taxa. The sequence data were analysed using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, Bayesian and neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree reconstruction, as well as base-pair substitution and insertion-deletion analysis. Revised species-level concepts were generated by identifying reciprocally monophyletic clades that exhibited unique conchological features. These analyses document that, although many previously described taxa have biological merit, the highly plastic nature of shell apertural features makes them unreliable indicators of species identity in several independent lineages. However, shell surface sculpture and architecture appear to provide more reliable diagnoses. Because of the traditional reliance of species-level taxonomy in Pupilla on plastic apertural features, too many species-level entities have been described in Europe and the Altai. Also, because taxonomically useful shell sculpture features have tended to be ignored, too few species have been described in eastern Asia and North America.

These specimens comprise an Ice Age genetic museum, and the DNA contained within them provide a means to observe evolutionary processes within populations over geologically significant time scales. Phylogenetic analyses can identify the taxonomic positions of extinct species and provide estimates of speciation dates. Geographic and temporal divisions apparent in the genetic data can be related to ecological change, human impacts, and possible landscape mosaics in Beringia. The application of ancient DNA techniques to traditional paleontological studies provides a new perspective to long-standing questions regarding the paleoenvironment and diversity of Late Pleistocene Beringia. | ['cooper', 'shapiro'] | ","['cooper', 'shapiro']",1

48,"Bioarchaeological Evidence for Social Maturation in the Mortuary Ritual of Ipiutak and Tigara Hunter-Gatherers: Lifespan Perspectives on the Emergence of Personhood at Point Hope, Alaska | Identity is a concept that shifts over the lifespan in association with relational interactions. This study documents and interprets the cultural systems influencing shifts in identity during maturation in hunter-gatherers from Point Hope, Alaska through archaeological mortuary practices. Grave goods, body position, body orientation, and burial depth (underground versus surface) were recorded for Ipiutak (1500-1100 BP) and Tigara (800-400 BP) cultures. Age was estimated using tooth formation. No age differences in burial depth were found, likely reflecting environmental constraints. Changes in body orientation, body position, and grave-good allocation were found between three and four years with another increase in grave-good allocation after age six. A larger age range of individuals without grave goods was found at Tigara. Changes in bodily orientation and position likely reflect beliefs surrounding the soul. The initial presence of animal implements may represent gifting of amulets, while increases in these items at later ages indicate continued maturation. Differences in the age ranges of individuals without animal implements between the two sites may reflect stronger delineations of social prestige at Ipiutak. These findings hint at the complex relational pathways associated with the formation of identity in prehistoric hunter-gatherer communities. | ['justice', 'temple'] | ","['justice', 'temple']",1
49,"Biodiversity on oceanic islands: A palaeoecological assessment | Islands are bounded ecosystems and serve as excellent laboratories for assessing changes in Biodiversity. Some oceanic islands, such as Madagascar, Bermuda and notably the islands in the Pacific (e.g. Hawaii), are home to unique forms of endemic plants and animals that have evolved in isolation over millions of years. The palaeoecological record indicates that such islands are characterized by waves of extinctions concomitant with colonization by humans. By way of contrast, the biota of the islands of the north Atlantic (Greenland, Iceland and Faroe) do not follow the expected pattern and the few extinctions recorded are very localized. This is not a result of the scale of human impact, which is as great as on other islands, but relates to the virtual lack of endemics. The dearth of endemic forms and the disharmonic nature of these island communities indicates a youthful biota and the operation of severe filters and sweepstakes during colonisation over the last 10,000 years. This paper draws upon an extensive invertebrate fossil record to contrast and examine these spatial and temporal patterns in island Biodiversity. | ['sadler'] | ",['sadler'],4
50,"Biogeographical evidence for the grass (Poaceae) species of Pleistocene Beringian lowlands | Late Pleistocene Beringia had herb-dominated vegetation with abundant grasses (Poaceae), and it was inhabited by an impressive assemblage of large grazing mammals. This paper reconstructs the list of most probable late Pleistocene Beringian lowland grass species from biogeographical evidence. Late Pleistocene eolian sediments and buried soils indicate that large areas of the Beringian lowlands had nutrient-rich, silty soils that occurred over ice-rich permafrost but were generally not waterlogged. A list of likely grasses was compiled from all species that have been recorded on similar fine-grained, mesic-to-dry lowland soils (i.e., presumed refugia) and are distributed at least sporadically across the whole region today. Grasses from 13 genera met these criteria, including most of the taxa that have been identified as late Pleistocene fossils from the study area. Most of these grasses are high-latitude species of genera that are also common in temperate latitudes (e.g., Elymus, Festuca, and Poa). This diverse group of plants has a wide range of adaptations today, suggesting that grasses would have been available to occupy a variety of habitats through Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Among these grasses are a number of highly productive forage species. | ['swanson'] | ",['swanson'],4
51,"Biogeography of North American highlands | North American highland habitats harbor exceptional species diversity, as well as high endemism in several distinct biomes. These include the cloud forest biome, subalpine biome and alpine biome found at high elevations in tropical and temperate mountains. Understanding the distribution of biodiversity in highland habitats, as well as the origin of endemic species, provides general insight into the evolutionary processes that generate new species. Major highland areas stretch from the Arctic Circle to the tropical southern border of Mexico, in a complex of old and young mountains. However, these highland areas are isolated from one another, and while highland species appear to be closely related across mountains, distinct endemic species are often found. Geological and paleoecological evidence suggests that past glacial climate fluctuations increased the connectivity of highland habitats, facilitating the movement of highland species during cool and wet climate episodes. Genetic studies of different plant and animal species have shown that the evolution of highland species has been rapid, with the distributional shifts from past climate change facilitating allopatric and peripatric speciation. Furthermore, in some rare cases, evolutionary divergence across steep ecological gradients found on mountain slopes has led to parapatric or sympatric speciation, with some lineages exhibiting adaptive radiation into novel ecological niches. Due to the wealth of biodiversity in these habitats, and the additional importance of highlands for the ecosystem services they provide to human communities, there is considerable concern about ongoing habitat destruction and climate change impacts on North American highlands. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

His family came from Lorraine in France and emigrated to Russia in the 18th Century. As director of the Kiev zoological Museum, Sarleman' coordinated the ornithological research. He himself published 325 works, including more than 250 with ornithological content. His most important works were the Zoogeography of the Ukraine (Sarleman' 1937a) and the first Avifauna for the whole of the Ukraine (Sarleman' 1938b). He also concerned himself with the historic-cultural changes in the landscape and fauna (Sarleman' 1938a), and was herpetologist, entomologist and mammologist.

53,"Biological Legacies: Direct early ecosystem recovery and food web reorganization after a volcanic eruption in Alaska | Attempts to understand how communities assemble following a disturbance are challenged by the difficulty of determining the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes. Biological legacies, which result from organisms that survive a disturbance, can favour deterministic processes in community assembly and improve predictions of successional trajectories. Recently disturbed ecosystems are often so rapidly colonized by propagules that the role of biological legacies is obscured. We studied biological legacies on a remote volcanic island in Alaska following a devastating eruption where the role of colonization from adjacent communities was minimized. The role of biological legacies in the near shore environment was not clear, because although some kelp survived, they were presumably overwhelmed by the many vagile propagules in a marine environment. The legacy concept was most applicable to terrestrial invertebrates and plants that survived in remnants of buried soil that were exposed by post-eruption erosion. If the legacy concept is extended to include ex situ survival by transient organisms, then it was also applicable to the island's thousands of seabirds, because the seabirds survived the eruption by leaving the island and have begun to return and rebuild their nests as local conditions improve. Our multi-trophic examination of biological legacies in a successional context suggests that the relative importance of biological legacies varies with the degree of destruction, the availability of colonizing propagules, the spatial and temporal scales under consideration, and species interactions. Understanding the role of biological legacies in community assembly following disturbances can help elucidate the relative importance of colonists versus survivors, the role of priority effects among the colonists, convergence versus divergence of successional trajectories, the influence of spatial heterogeneity, and the role of island biogeographical concepts. | ['degange', 'jewett', 'michaelson', 'sikes', 'talbot', 'talbot', 'walker', 'wang', 'williams'] | ","['degange', 'jewett', 'michaelson', 'sikes', 'talbot', 'talbot', 'walker', 'wang', 'williams']",4

Clethrionomys, Microtus, Lemmus and forms of the Dicrostonychini are present throughout the sequence which is also punctuated by 2 appearances of Phenacomys. Evolutionary changes can be recognized within the Dicrostonyx lineage, the fossils of which are analyzed in terms of morphotypes defined by Agadjanian and von Koenigswald (1977). Vole fossils bearing similarities to M. paroperarius are labeled ""Microtus sp.

The Yukon sequence is arranged in terms of intervals defined by Hopkins (1982), and possible correlations with Alaskan and Siberian sediments and faunas are discussed. The Beringian microtine record is incomplete, poorly dated, and composed of samples that are often very small.

58,"Birch bark in the funeral rite of the Yakuts: a case-study of the Uchugei-Yuryakh burial (15<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup> cc.) | The Uchugei-Yuryakh birch-bark burial, radiocarbon dated to 1480-1640 cal AD, was discovered in the southern part of the Tuymaada valley, located in the basin of the Middle Lena River, one of the largest rivers in North-Eastern Siberia. This region is traditionally regarded as the area where the most important events of the Yakut history were taking place over many centuries, and as the area associated with the formation of the Yakut ethnic culture. The purpose of this article is to introduce into scientific discourse the results of the study of the Uchugei-Yuryakh birch-bark burial and to analyze traditions of the burials using birch bark among the Yakuts in the 15<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> centuries, according to archaeological, ethnographic, and folklore data. The research objectives are as follows: to determine the level of knowledge of the problem; to identify peculiarities of the grave goods and morphological features of the Uchugei-Yuryakh burial; to identify types of birch-bark burial chambers of the Yakuts on the basis of available data; to trace back their genesis and to determine their semantics, according to the sacral nature of birch bark in the ritual-worldview practice; and to correlate the features of the Yakut burials with archaeological materials from the regions adjacent to Yakutia. Descriptive and historical-comparative methods, as well as scientific methods such as radiocarbon dating of the bones of the deceased, chemical analysis of bead material, botanical analysis of plant material from the burial site were employed in the course of research. A characteristic feature of this burial is the absence of a coffin and the use of birch-bark sheets to form the interior of the grave, which correlates with the legends about the Khoro tribe, who practiced burial in birch-bark sheaths. There are four types of burials identified on the basis of a detailed analysis of the combination of elements of the currently known birch-bark burial structures: 1) in a birch bark sheath consisting of birch-bark sheets placed above and below the buried body; 2) in a birch bark pouch, the sides of which were reinforced by wooden planks set on edge; 3) in a rectangular birch bark sheet, in which the body of the deceased was wrapped to form a case or a cylinder; 4) in a birch-bark sheath sewn in the form of a boat. Analysis of the features of the burial (atypical ‚Äúfacedown‚Äù position of the deceased, scanty set of items of the accompanying goods) revealed a special social status of the buried man. The birch-bark sheets laid above and below the deceased in the considered burial, apparently, imitate the shape of the birch-bark basket tyuktyuye . This suggests the ideas of purification of the soul of the deceased after their death and its rebirth. Birch bark was used in the funeral rites of the nomadic societies of South-Eastern and Western Siberia in the Middle Ages. It is suggested that the tradition of using birch bark in Yakut burials either corresponds with the Samoyed-Yenisei component, indirectly adopted from the medieval population of the Lake Baikal area, or emerged due to direct contacts with the Tungus-Samoyed tribes of the Lower Tunguska. –†–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –±–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—ã –≤ –ø–æ–≥—Ä–µ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –æ–±—Ä—è–¥–µ —è–∫—É—Ç–æ–≤. –í –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ, —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ, —Ñ–æ–ª—å–∫–ª–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã, –≤ —Ç–æ–º —á–∏—Å–ª–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –ø–æ–ª–µ–≤—ã—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤. –ü—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥—è—Ç—Å—è –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —Ç–∏–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –ø–æ–≥—Ä–µ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–∞–º–µ—Ä –∏–∑ –±–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—ã, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–∞ –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ç—å –∏—Ö –≥–µ–Ω–µ–∑–∏—Å –∏ –≤—ã—è–≤–∏—Ç—å —Å–µ–º–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–∫—É –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥—è –∏–∑ —Å–∞–∫—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –±–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—ã –≤ —Ä–∏—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–µ —è–∫—É—Ç–æ–≤. | ['bravina', 'petrov', 'solovyova', 'syrovatskiy'] | ","['bravina', 'petrov', 'solovyova', 'syrovatskiy']",0

60,"Birds in the medieval culture and economy of the East Slavs in the 10-13th centuries AD | The paper is devoted to a re-examination of the bird remains from the numerous East Slavic settlements (10-13th centuries AD). Species diversity suggests that medieval people in the Eastern Europe used birds for food, falconry, in ritual and, possibly, for aviary specimens and pets. Furthermore, bird feathers were used for preparing arrows. The most popular bird of prey was goshawk. Primary game birds were ducks, geese, swans, common crane and corvids along with black grouse and capercaillie in forest zones. The archaeological data present evidence for the use of wild birds (e.g., hooded crow) in funeral ceremonies for the first time. The majority of the identified birds have not changed their distribution, but in recent times some of these taxa have become rarer. Red-breasted goose is now extant in the area but its remains were found in the medieval layers, although this species could have been an occasional visitor in the Ukraine. Archaeological data and historical sources prove that white stork has lived in the territory of Ukraine since the Middle Ages or even earlier. The most common domestic poultry for the East Slavs was chicken. Domestic ducks and geese were much rarer. Historical documents were also consulted in this study and these also contribute to our understanding of the role of birds in the life of the East Slavs. | ['gorobets', 'kovalchuk'] | ","['gorobets', 'kovalchuk']",4
61,"The birds of St. Matthew Island, Bering Sea | St. Matthew Island (60degree 24' N, 172degree 42' W) and its small nearby satellites, Hall Island and Pinnacle Rock, are isolated in the northcentral Bering Sea. This infrequently visited location occupies a geographic position with a deep Bering Land Bridge history and is in an area of interdigitation of the Old World, New World, and Beringian avifaunas. It is known for its three Beringian endemics, a bird (McKay's Bunting, Plectrophenax hyperboreus), a small mammal, and a plant. This level of endemism is striking for a high-latitude island. The only previous summary of the avifauna of St. Matthew island (Hanna 1917) included 37 species. Our report considers more than 125 species and synthesizes data on presence and absence, abundance, and phenology. Because visits have been infrequent and concentrated during summer, our understanding of migration in this region remains poor, but the area is clearly affected by both the Old and New world migration systems. There is sufficient evidence to show that some profound changes among the island's breeding birds have occurred during the past century. In particular, the breeding range of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) has been extended north to include St. Matthew, a change that is correlated with a northward shift in the extent of sea ice (Maslanik et al. 1996). King and Common eiders (Somateria spectabilis and S. mollissima) also have shown substantial changes in summer abundance. Other changes in the summer avifauna (e.g., among shorebirds) may reflect the dynamics of edge-of-range phenomena. Because of its central position in a region undergoing profound climate change and its demonstrated track record in showing avifaunal shifts, St. Matthew Island may represent an important bellwether for monitoring the biological effects of further climate change in the northern Bering Sea. | ['causey', 'gibson', 'hoberg', 'lawhead', 'martin', 'sowls', 'winker'] | ","['causey', 'gibson', 'hoberg', 'lawhead', 'martin', 'sowls', 'winker']",4

64,"Bowhead whale bones and Thule Eskimo subsistence-settlement patterns in the central Canadian Arctic | Bowhead whale bones in prehistoric Thule Eskimo contexts have been examined since 1975 in the central Canadian Arctic (Arctic Ocean). Approximately 10,500 bones, representing almost 1000 animals, have been counted on the shores of six adjacent islands. Comparisons of Thule-derived bowhead samples with live Beaufort Sea samples and Early Holocene samples indicate that Thule Eskimo hunters selected yearlings and two- to three-year-old subadults, to the almost complete exclusion of calves and adults. Almost all bowheads found at Thule sites measure 7-10 m in length, estimated by regression analyses based on Alaskan bowhead skeletons of known size. Archaeological bowhead bones represent several stages of past hunting and processing behavior, including selective hunting, beach flensing and meat/blubber caching, winter house construction, and bone re-use from house ruins. The availability and abundance of bowheads were primary determinants of Thule subsistence-settlement patterns in this region. Archaeological whale bones are a nonrenewable cultural resource of the New World Arctic that deserve study and protection. | ['mccartney', 'savelle'] | ","['mccartney', 'savelle']",0
65,"Part 2. Bryophytes | Bryophytes were mentioned for the first time in the Svalbard literature in 1675. The early bryological history up to 1875 is thoroughly reviewed, and the important later papers are presented. AD known papers and books with reports of bryophytes from Svalbard have been scanned for taxonomic and geographical information. In all, 563 bryophyte species (current names excluding synonyms) have been considered. Of these, 190 have been shown or critically considered to be erroneous, leaving a total of 373 accepted bryophytes (85 hepatics and 288 mosses in 137 genera). One hundred and fifty (26 hepatics and 124 mosses) are accepted from Bjornoya, and five of these are not known from the rest of Svalbard. Short or sometimes more extensive comments are made on 315 accepted and ail rejected species; the comments usually include all reported localities with literature references, as well as numerous unreported localities based on own herbarium material. Six species are reported from Svalbard for the first time, and Plagiothecium svalbardense is described as new. One hundred and one valid bryophyte names (29 species, 3 subspecies, 58 varieties and 11 forms) have been based on type material from Svalbard, and 18 of these are basionyms of accepted species (Appendix 1). Two exsiccates have appeared, viz. Musci Spetsbergenses Exsiccati (Berggren 1875, with 220 numbered specimens) and Bryophyta Svalbardensia exsiccata (Bednarek-Ochyra et al. 1987, with 80 numbers). Numerical and alphabetical lists, including some revisions, are given to both (Appendix 2).

69,"A century of conservation: The ongoing recovery of svalbard reindeer | Several caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) populations have experienced recent population declines, often attributed to anthropogenic stressors such as harvesting, landscape fragmentation, and climate change. Svalbard reindeer (R. t. platyrhynchus), the wild reindeer subspecies endemic to the high-Arctic Svalbard archipelago, was protected in 1925, after most subpopulations had been eradicated by harvest. Although direct pressure from harvest has ceased, indirect anthropogenic stressors from environmental changes have increased in this climate change hot spot. An assessment of the current distribution and abundance is therefore urgently needed. We combined distance sampling (300 km transects, n = 489 reindeer groups) and total counts (1,350 km(2), n = 1,349 groups) to estimate the Svalbard reindeer distribution and abundance across its entire range, which we compared with historical data from the literature and radiocarbon-dated bones. Reindeer have now recolonized nearly all non-glaciated land (i.e., areas occupied prior to human presence), and their spatial variation in abundance reflects vegetation productivity. Independent of vegetation productivity, however, recently recolonized areas have lower reindeer densities than areas not subject to past extirpation. This suggests that recovery from past overharvesting is still in progress. These incompletely recovered areas are potential targets for increased monitoring frequency and maintaining strict conservation to follow the Svalbard management goal (i.e., virtually untouched wilderness areas). Because of such ongoing recolonization, possibly combined with vegetation greening effects of recent warming, our status estimate of Svalbard reindeer abundance (22,435 [95% CI = 21,452-23,425]) is more than twice a previous estimate based on opportunistic counts. Thus, although our study demonstrates the successful outcome of strict harvesting control implemented a century ago, current and future population trajectories are likely shaped by climate change.

70,"Cereal cultivation as a correlate of high social status in medieval Iceland | Utilising a multi-profile palynological approach and a rapid scanning technique, this paper examines whether or not cereal cultivation is representative of a medieval Icelandic farmstead's social status; first as a correlate by confirming that cereals were grown in association with the archaeological features characteristic of high status and second, as an indicator in its own right through comparison with other datasets from inferred lower status farms in the same valley. The results suggest that medieval cereal cultivation in Mosfellsdalur was confined to the landholding of the Mosfell Estate. This is probably a direct consequence of the locale being settled early during Iceland's colonisation and thereby allowing settlers there to secure the prime location in the valley for agriculture. The later abandonment of cereal cultivation on the Estate also appears to be linked to social circumstances in Mosfellsdalur c. ad 1200. An evaluation of other pollen studies and historical sources intimates a transition in cereal cultivation from inland toward coastal (and perhaps geothermal) sites in the mid-13th century, probably as a consequence of the onset of the Little Ice Age. These sites may also be linked with high status institutions. Despite this effort to adapt to altered climate conditions, cereal cultivation in Iceland is believed to have been completely abandoned by ad 1500. Overall, the temporal and spatial dynamics of cereal cultivation are shown to be complex, subject to both societal and environmental changes. | ['byock', 'edward', 'erlendsson', 'gisladottir', 'riddell', 'zori'] | ","['byock', 'edward', 'erlendsson', 'gisladottir', 'riddell', 'zori']",1
71,"Cereal cultivation from the Iron Age to historical times: evidence from inland and coastal settlements in northernmost Fennoscandia | For several decades researchers have debated when cereal cultivation was introduced to northernmost Europe. Most previous studies have concentrated on sites along the coast or close to major rivers; these are areas well-suited to agriculture and represent routes for people and knowledge transfer, but omit other vast areas suitable for cultivation and sedentary settlement. Here, we present strong evidence of permanent cultivation from ad 480 onwards at a settlement located at the 64th parallel North in northern Sweden, currently situated 30 km inland from the Gulf of Bothnia. This predates the beginning of permanent cultivation at sites along the present coastline mentioned here and in results from previous studies of places at approximately the same latitude. Our results are based on continuous finds of cereal pollen grains at certain sites, selected on the basis of archaeological records, old maps, plus past and present elevations above sea level. We highlight the importance of taking factors into account such as access to waterways, communication routes and coast displacement following land uplift when choosing study sites in order to pinpoint early cultivation and sedentary settlements. We suggest that these results have implications for attempts to resolve the question of the history of early agriculture in other parts of northern Fennoscandia. | ['bergman', 'hornberg', 'josefsson', 'liedgren'] | ","['bergman', 'hornberg', 'josefsson', 'liedgren']",1
72,"A charcoal-rich horizon at O69, Greenland: evidence for vegetation burning during the Norse landnam? | It is often assumed that the colonisation of Greenland by Norse settlers in c. A.D. 985 had a sudden and dramatic effect on the environment, involving substantial vegetation clearance and environmental degradation. Consequently, it has been argued that charcoal-rich horizons, visible in many sections in Greenland, represent the initial burning of the vegetation by Norse farmers to create land suitable for agriculture. In this study a charcoal-rich layer, visible in a modern drainage ditch beside the Norse farm of 069, was analysed using archaeobotany, sedimentary analysis and radiocarbon dating to test the date and formation processes of the horizon. It is demonstrated that the charcoal-rich layer at 069 was not derived from in situ vegetation burning in the 10th century and concluded that the layer was probably formed by the addition of midden material to the infields around 069 in the 13th and 14th centuries cal AD, perhaps as part of a soil amendment strategy. It is argued that caution must be exercised when interpreting charcoal-rich horizons as time-specific chronological markers in palaeoenvironmental sequences in Greenland. (C) 2013 The Authors.

73,"Charred remains of grains and seeds from the medieval high-status farm site of Reykholt in western Iceland | Iceland was settled, primarily by peoples from Norway and the northern British Isles, in the 9th and 10th centuries. The first settlers brought with them from their homelands an agricultural system based on animal husbandry, of which cereal cultivation was an element and also with inputs from fishing, hunting and gathering of wild plants. There are strong indications that barley was cultivated during the first centuries in some parts of the country and that cultivation was at least attempted in other areas. However, Iceland is near the climatic limits of the barley-growing zone, and it is open to discussion how reliable a food source locally grown barley would have been. This paper discusses a seed assemblage of cultivated barley and archetypical weeds of cereal crops dated to between the 10th and 12th centuries AD obtained during archaeological excavations at the high status farm of Reykholt in western Iceland. | ['gudmundsson', 'hillman', 'sveinbjarnardottir'] | ","['gudmundsson', 'hillman', 'sveinbjarnardottir']",4
74,"Chloroplast DNA diversity in Calluna vulgaris (heather) populations in Europe | Variation in the chloroplast genome of Calluna vulgaris (heather), the dominant species of northwest European heath communities, was analysed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLPs) and microsatellites. No length polymorphisms were detected in the 100-200 base pair (bp) fragments amplified by the conserved microsatellite primers, and sequencing revealed that the repeat regions were interrupted relative to the corresponding sequence in Nicotiana tabacum. In contrast, PCR-RFLP analysis revealed high levels of haplotype diversity within populations (hS = 0.443, hT = 0.842), as well as substantial differentiation between populations (GST = 0.473). Diversity and differentiation were higher in southern Europe than in northern Europe. Interpreted in the light of data from allozyme studies and pollen core records, the results suggest that the main glacial refugia for C. vulgaris were located in southwest Europe, including northern Spain, the Pyrenees and the Massif Central region of France. There is also evidence for diffuse survival of the species at more northerly latitudes. | ['ennos', 'rendell'] | ","['ennos', 'rendell']",1

76,"The colonization of Ireland: A human ecology perspective | Human migration throughout northern Europe following the Last Glacial Maximum is an ideal situation to investigate human colonization and adaptation in new landscapes. This is particularly so in Ireland, which possesses a distinctly compressed archaeological record compared to the rest of Europe. While various periods of Paleolithic occupations are well-documented throughout Europe, including Britain, the initial colonization of Ireland appears to be delayed until the Early Holocene. An assessment of archaeological and paleoenvironmental data suggests that inhospitable environmental conditions, spe-cifically the absence of mature woodland ecosystems, substantially delayed the human colonization of Ireland. Once Mesolithic peoples reached Ireland, the absence of familiar fauna led them to quickly modify existing technologies. These local adaptions are reflected in the discontinuation of composite microlith technologies that characterize the rest of the European Mesolithic record. Within 1000 years of colonization, Mesolithic hunter-gatherers developed a uniquely Irish macrolith-based technology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. | ['tune'] | ",['tune'],4
77,"Colonizing Seascapes: Comparative Perspectives on the Development of Maritime Relations in Scandinavia and Patagonia | The lowering of global sea level during the Pleistocene by more than 100 m and subsequent inundation of coastal areas constitutes a problem in terms of general research on early maritime-oriented societies. However, post-glacial isostatic rise in glaciated regions has produced raised shorelines of Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene age, e.g., in Scandinavia, Patagonia, and North America. As these regions contain the oldest preserved coastal areas, they are imperative for the understanding of the development of maritime hunter-gatherers. The extensive Norwegian coastline appears to have been colonized in the course of the few hundred years around 9500 cal B.C. An overwhelming majority of Early Holocene sites are found in the fiord/skerry coastal landscape, indicating that marine resources were vital in the subsistence pattern of people occupying the region. The lithic tradition is clearly linked to specialized megafauna hunters in the continental plains (the Ahrensburgian complex of northwestern Europe), but the facts about and dynamics of the development of the marine subsistence pattern are unclear. This paper focuses on this problem-with comparative perspectives towards the emergence of maritime foragers in Patagonia. | ['bjerck'] | ",['bjerck'],4

Their study is based on comparative materials of European Russia. Accounting for archaeological finds and museum exhibits allows the author to develop a typology of the combs with horse head, as well as to determine the chronology of their existence. The shape of the product, on the basis of which three types are distinguished is considered as the leading sign. According to the author, it can be considered proven that the combs with horse head beyond the Urals appeared with the arrival of the Russian population. Based on the typology performed, it can be assumed that in the 16th - 19th centuries there were two penetrating streams of the combs with horse head in Western Siberia. The first stream occurred in the 16th - 17th centuries, when combs of the first and second types appeared here. This penetration can be conventionally called the ¬´North Russian¬ª. The second penetrating stream which was characterized by the third type of the comb-pendants took place to the 19th century. The author believes that according to a number of signs, the second stream of penetration could be a consequence of the Volga region influence. ¬© 2020 Academy of Sciences of Tatarstan, A.Kh.

80,"The Commander Islands: The tragedy of Bering and Steller's arctic foxes | The Captain-Commander Vitus Bering stranded on Bering Island outside the coast of Kamchatka in 1741, on the return from his voyage to Alaska. Bering himself died on the island, but more than half of the crew survived, including the naturalist and physician Georg Steller. The ship-wrecked men faced the enemies of scurvy, hunger and cold - and arctic foxes Alopex lagopus. The foxes invaded their camp and molested them cunningly, to such an extent that the men not only killed a large number but also tortured many foxes. The foxes stole food, dragged away with all sorts of items, and mutilated the dead. The tame nature of these foxes probably resulted from long isolation without any contact with humans, a similar behaviour has also been reported from other isolated islands (e.g. Jan Mayen and Greenland). Since the discovery of the Commander Islands, the Aleutians and Alaska, numerous hunting expeditions set out from both Russia and America and returned with thousands of pelts of arctic foxes, sea otter, fur seals and sea lions. The Steller sea cow was exterminated in a few years, and the sea otter only narrowly escaped extermination. The arctic fox survived on the Commander Islands and was extensively hunted until recently. The blue foxes there are still tame and cunning, but now less so in winter than in summer. Since 1993, the two tiny islands have been protected as a Nature Reserve. Foxes still thrive on Bering Island, but the foxes on Mednyi Island have suffered from an alarmingly high mortality and reduction in population size. A reason for this may be ear mange introduced by dogs, to which the foxes appear to be much susceptive. The foxes on the two Commander Islands possibly belong to two isolated subspecies, and it would be tragic if they were to be exterminated. On Mednyi Island the foxes live in large family groups of up to 6 grown-up individuals defending a common territory, even today when the territory, even today when reduced. Morphological adaptations may possibly include large size or weight, but reduced height, giving them a less elegant motion. | ['frafjord', 'kruchenkova'] | ","['frafjord', 'kruchenkova']",4
81,"Comparing fill and floor: A taphonomic framework for understanding depositional histories in a semi-subterranean house in north-west Alaska | Collapsed semi-subterranean dwelling features are often excellent sources for well-preserved faunal, artefactual, and architectural material in the Arctic. However, collapsed structures may be reused after house abandonment as storage areas, hunting blinds, refuse areas, or other resource facilities. Despite their reuse and possibly different occupation period, artefacts and faunal material from the fill are often employed, uncritically, to interpret the original house occupation. Within a Thule Inuit house depression, I employ an analytical framework as a heuristic device to compare the social nature of the various faunal deposits and the processes that affected them. Analyses show that the taphonomic processes alter the fill more extensively and intensively than the underlying floor. The floor shows little post-depositional disturbance and is evidence for a cold-season occupation. By contrast, the fill is a palimpsest of multiple occupations, some possibly related to the house occupation. Archaeologists need to differentiate fill from floor contexts when talking about the original occupation because the taphonomy of the two contexts indicate each is a distinct set of assemblages with differing operative processes. | ['norman'] | ",['norman'],1

Results of this comparison suggest that heathland shrubs were an important fodder resource for caprines in both Iceland and Greenland while apophytes (""weedy taxa"") were part of the cattle fodder in Greenland. Further, the results indicate that mucking out of cattle barns to provide fertilizer was likely practiced at the GUS site in the Western Norse settlement of Greenland. | ['ross', 'zutter'] | ","['ross', 'zutter']",4

85,"Compound-specific amino acid Œ¥15N values in archaeological shell: Assessing diagenetic integrity and potential for isotopic baseline reconstruction | Rationale: Reconstructing stable isotope (SI) ratios at the base of paleo-food webs is often challenging. For coastal systems, the SI ratios of organic matter in archeological shell represents a possible solution, providing a direct record of primary consumer SI ratios in the littoral zone. However, shell is often porous, with organic compounds susceptible to diagenetic alteration or contamination. If molecular isotopic information is well preserved, compound-specific amino acid isotope analysis (CSI-AA) has the potential to provide direct proxies for baseline SI ratios, bypassing many contamination issues, and to allow assessment of the diagenetic state. Methods: We collected shell from both archeological middens and nearby littoral zones in coastal Alaska, and used a simple organic extraction approach based on decalcification with sequential weak HCl additions to liberate organic material. We measured CSI-AA patterns, molar AA distributions, and the CSI-AA degradation parameter (Œ£V), in the context of bulk SI ratios in fossil shell, modern shell, and soft tissue from five common taxa (urchin, limpet, mussel, periwinkle, chiton). Results: CSI-AA patterns in both soft tissue and shell were consistent with primary consumers, and were indistinguishable in most modern and fossil shell pairs, showing that amino acid Œ¥15N values can be well preserved in archeological shell. AA molar distributions were also similar, although most fossil shell was enriched in Asx and Gly. Comparison between CSI-AA results from modern specimens confirmed that the source AA group (tracking isotopic baselines) are transferred without substantial modification into the shell record. In contrast, the Trophic AA group had elevated Œ¥15N values in shell versus soft tissue for all taxa examined, suggesting that a correction factor will be required for any CSI-AA proxies using these AAs. Conclusions: Overall, this new data indicates that the CSI-AA analysis of fossil shell represents a promising new approach to determining isotopic baselines in coastal paleo-ecosystems.

86,"Concerning the antiquity and origin of reindeer breeding | ACCORDING to existing archaeological data the domestication of the reindeer in the north of Eurasia and America preceded that of the horse. However, no reindeer remains have been found in the palaeo-and neolithic strata. Hence it is impossible to determine accurately the period during which reindeer breeding arose, but it is obvious that, in the north, the reindeer replaced the dog as a transport animal. Anthropological and ethnographical evidence indicates that the reindeer was domesticated by the hunting and not by the settled agricultural tribes. The view that reindeer breeding first arose in a single centre (the Altai-Sayan Plateau) is untenable. The author considers that it arose at various times in several centres. The fact that, among different tribes in Northern Siberia, the reindeer is variously used as a mount, as a draught animal, or as a source of meat supply in identical environments supports this contention. | ['levin', 'zolotarev'] | ","['levin', 'zolotarev']",1
87,"Congruence or concordance in archaeobotany: Assessing micro- and macro-botanical data sets from Icelandic middens | Archaeological farm middens dating from the Viking Age to early modern times are found throughout the North Atlantic region and contribute information regarding past ecological and economic conditions. Archaeobotanical investigations of two Icelandic farm midden sites are interpreted for plant-use trends in this northern pastoral economic system. Macro-botanical (i.e., seeds, leaves) and micro-botanical (i.e., pollen) remains are compared in order to assess the degree of congruence between these differing data sets. The background signature of macro- and micro-botanical variability in Icelandic pastoral practices is established through the analysis of present-day farmyard contexts for the assessment of differing archaeobotanical remains. Results indicate micro- and macro-botanical remains from Icelandic archaeological sites are not congruent since plants and plant parts are differentially collected and utilized by humans and these patterns of plant-use will effect whether or not micro-or macro-remnants are incorporated into the archaeological record. | ['zutter'] | ",['zutter'],1
88,"Consensus dating of mammoth remains from Wrangel Island | Previous results from remains of tusks, teeth and bones collected from Wrangel Island (Vartanyan et al. 1995) had given results in the range 3730 BP to 20,000 BP and the authors had concluded that 'mammoths inhabited Wrangel Island for as long as 6000 yr after the estimated extinction on the Siberian continent'. There still remained the question of the earliest date for such remains. Further, the authors had noted such samples may present some difficulty in dating and therefore duplicate samples had been measured in a second laboratory with satisfactory results. The replicate dating of important or controversial samples in more than one laboratory is well-established (e.g., Turin Shroud) and in this paper, we present results for 5 mammoth samples dated by 6 laboratories. Such interlaboratory comparisons provide an independent means of verification of laboratory comparability, and give added confidence in the results, particularly when applied to more controversial samples. A further objective of the work has been to evaluate the material for inclusion in any large-scale interlaboratory comparison, such comparisons having in the past formed part of laboratory quality assurance protocols. The design and organization of a laboratory intercomparison requires homogeneous samples in sufficient quantity to satisfy participants, and so in principle, a single mammoth tusk would meet these criteria. Samples such as the mammoth tusk have been used in previous intercomparisons: e.g., in the last large-scale international intercomparison (Gulliksen and Scott 1995), whalebone was one of the materials distributed. One of the key advantages of such material is that a single sample (a mammoth tusk) can be resampled for analysis by multiple labs and thus does not require bulk homogenization. Therefore, as part of a preselection process for a future intercomparison, five samples from separate mammoth tusks were collected from Wrangel Island in 1995 in sufficient quantity to allow multiple dating. The aim was to identify five separate samples of young age, sample up to 1 kg from each tusk and mark the location so that after preliminary dating, samples could be retrieved as required in the future. Six laboratories received samples for dating. The paper will discuss the results from the laboratories, present consensus values, and make recommendations concerning use of these samples in a future laboratory intercomparison. | ['arslanov', 'cook', 'gulliksen', 'harkness', 'kankainen', 'scott', 'vartanyan', 'zaitseva'] | ","['arslanov', 'cook', 'gulliksen', 'harkness', 'kankainen', 'scott', 'vartanyan', 'zaitseva']",4

90,"A Context-Appropriate Approach to Marine 14C Calibration: Œîr and Bayesian Framework for the Nuvuk Cemetery, Point Barrow, Alaska | This study provides an assessment of the temporal changes in ŒîR, which is the local deviation from the global surface water marine reservoir effect (MRE), in the Point Barrow area of the Alaskan Arctic, a coastal archaeological area that has experienced severe erosion accelerated by global warming. A total of 26 samples were submitted for radiocarbon (14C) dating from eight secure Thule (AD 1000-1750) archaeological contexts, and specifically from archaeological features with paired processed seal and caribou bones that had been frozen in situ. This new approach towards ŒîR estimation provides a best-fit local correction for the 14C dating of human populations by focusing on the marine mammal (seals) predominantly consumed by the Thule (Coltrain et al. 2016). The weighted-mean ŒîR value on these pairs is 450 ¬± 84 yr, which is about 50 years less than the weighted-mean (506 ¬± 69 yr) for the Point Barrow area calculated through 14C measurements from four known-age bivalves collected in AD 1913 (McNeely et al. 2006). The effects of using this new ŒîR value for calibration was assessed through the Bayesian chronological modeling of 54 14C measurements from samples of human skeletons interred in the Nuvuk cemetery at Point Barrow, the largest ancient cemetery in northwest Alaska and traditionally thought to date to the Thule and earlier Birnirk (AD 500-1000) periods. ¬© 2019 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona. | ['derek', 'hamilton', 'jensen', 'krus', 'sayle'] | ","['derek', 'hamilton', 'jensen', 'krus', 'sayle']",4
91,"A continuous record of environmental change in Chukotka during the last 350 thousand years | The comprehensive study of the upper 1283 cm of sediment from Lake El'gygytgyn, which formed nearly 4 million years ago following a meteorite impact in northern Chukotka, yielded the first continuous record of extreme changes in Beringian climate and vegetation from the middle Middle Pleistocene to Recent time (marine isotope stage equivalent of 1-7 and the upper part of isotope stage 8). During this period, the climate was warmer than at present between 8600 and 10700 <sup>14</sup>C years BP and during the Late Pleistocene interglaciation (isotope substage 5e, 116-128 thousand years ago). In 2003, the German-Russian-USA international expedition continued studying sediments of Lake El'gygytgyn to obtain new evidence of the change in the vegetation cover in the Middle Pleistocene and the first information on the Middle Pleistocene interglaciation (isotope stage 9, 297-347 thousand years ago). Pollen spectra characterizing the Middle Pleistocene interglaciation are similar to spectra of the early stage of the Middle Pleistocene interglaciation and the climatic optimum in the Pleistocene to Holocene transitional period. The climatic history of Lake El'gygytgyn is the basis for stratigraphic reconstructions and correlations in the eastern sector of the Arctic. These data also expand understanding of climatic changes within the international projects ""Pole-Equator-Pole Paleoclimate Project"", ""Past Global Changes Project"", and others. –ü—Ä–∏ –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–Ω–æ–º –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–≥–æ 1283-—Å–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–º–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ —Å–ª–æ—è –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –æ–∑. –≠–ª—å–≥—ã–≥—ã—Ç–≥—ã–Ω, –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–≤—à–µ–≥–æ—Å—è –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 4 –º–ª–Ω –ª–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥ –ø—Ä–∏ –ø–∞–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –º–µ—Ç–µ–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–µ –ß—É–∫–æ—Ç–∫–∏, –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–µ—Ä—ã–≤–Ω–∞—è –ª–µ—Ç–æ–ø–∏—Å—å —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–∫ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–æ–≤ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ë–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–≥–∏–∏ –æ—Ç —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—ã —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ –ø–ª–µ–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –¥–æ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ—Ç–æ–ø–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–∏ 1-7 –∏ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω—è—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –∏–∑–æ—Ç–æ–ø–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–∏ 8). –í —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç –±—ã–ª —Ç–µ–ø–ª–µ–µ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ 8600-10700 –ª. –Ω.

96,"Crustacea (Branchiopoda) among Organic Remains from Mammoth Hair | The purpose of this study is to analyze the taxonomic composition of the branchiopod crustaceans (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) from the assemblage of animal and plant remains recovered from fossil mammoth hair found in the Allaikha River basin, Sakha Republic, Russian Federation. We studied the hair structure. AMS radiocarbon dating of both the hair itself and the remains demonstrated their different ages. We found different animal and plant remains in the hair taphocoenosis. The most diverse and numerous remains belong to branchiopod crustaceans: resting eggs and distal portions of the mandibles of Anostraca, distal portions of the mandibles of Notostraca, filtering limbs of some Anostraca or Daphniidae, ephippia of Daphnia (Daphnia) curvirostris, Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) atkinsoni, and D.

The reasons for the extinction of Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) in northeastern Eurasia require additional special study. We also emphasize the need for further studies of the morphology of ephippia, resting eggs, and mandibles of recent Branchiopoda, which would be essential for adequate identification of Pleistocene remains. | ['chernova', 'gololobova', 'izyumova', 'kirillova', 'kotov', 'neretina', 'shidlovskiy', 'trofimova', 'zanina', 'zharov', 'zinovyev'] | ","['chernova', 'gololobova', 'izyumova', 'kirillova', 'kotov', 'neretina', 'shidlovskiy', 'trofimova', 'zanina', 'zharov', 'zinovyev']",4

In this regard, the diagnostic characters and geographical ranges of two potentially invasive Asian buprestid species: the quarantine apple tree pest,Agrilus maliMatsumura, and the poplar pestA. fleischeriObenberger are studied and analyzed. Based on the examination of museum collections and literature sources, the diagnostic characters to distinguish both species from their congeners are discussed, the comprehensive databases of records of the exact collecting sites are compiled, and detailed maps of their ranges are generated.

Outbreak sites ofA. maliin Xinjiang most likely represent the newly forming invasion areas; their proximity to the wild apple stands in the Kazakh part of the Tien Shan is a direct threat to Kazakhstan and adjacent countries. Sites damaged byA. fleischeriin Liaoning are situated within its native range; the outbreaks were likely triggered by the switch from indigenous to introduced poplars. The results of the study will facilitate the correct identification and monitoring of the pests in case of their findings in new areas. Our goal is to analyze the known geographical ranges and diagnostic features of two potentially invasive Asian buprestid species: the quarantine apple tree pest,Agrilus maliMatsumura, and the poplar pestA. fleischeriObenberger. Based on the examination of museum collections and literature sources, we compiled comprehensive databases of records of the exact collecting sites for both species and generated detailed maps of their ranges. There are 51 documented localities forA. maliin the Russian Far East and East Siberia, Mongolia, China, and the Korean peninsula, and there are 53 documented localities forA. fleischeriin the Far East and Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and Japan. No evidence of the presence ofA. maliin Japan was found. Outbreak sites ofA. maliin Xinjiang in the 2000s most likely represent the newly forming invasion areas; their proximity to the wild apple stands in the Kazakh part of the Tien Shan is a direct threat to Kazakhstan and adjacent countries. Sites damaged byA. fleischeriin Liaoning are situated within its native range; the outbreaks were likely triggered by the switch from indigenous to introduced poplars.

101,"Dating of Russian hunting stations in south spitsbergen using dendrochronological and radiocarbon analyses | Excavations conducted in 1982-1987 by the Polish archaeological expedition of Jagiellonian University in the S√∏rkappland and Hornsund fjord regions of Spitsbergen encompassed the three Pomor hunting stations of Bj√∏rnbeinflyene, Palffyodden, and Sch√∂nningholmane, and included relics from the landing site on the T√∏rrflya coast used by the Pomors. The wood recovered during the excavations, originating from wooden dwellings, monumental crosses, and a shipwreck, was subjected to dendrochronological analysis. In total, 26 samples were examined, which allowed for the following chronologies to be developed: SPITS_A3 (larch, 9 samples, 208 yr); SPITS_B1 (pine, 5 samples, 222 yr); and SPITS_C1 (spruce, 2 samples, 142 yr). The dendrochronological dating obtained for the spruce sequence was established as AD 1769-1910. The chronological position of the remaining sequences was established by means of wiggle-matching. The results suggest that the youngest rings of the larch sequence cannot be older than AD 1745, and the youngest rings of the pine sequence date within the period of AD 1697-1805 or 1837-1869. Absolute dates obtained for the wood from the huts from the northern part of S√∏rkappland are consistent with the chronological framework established based on historical data. Thus, the hypothesis positing pre-Barents chronology of the Russian promysl in the investigated area could not be confirmed. ¬© 2016 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona. | ['chochorowski', 'kr', 'ƒñpiec'] | ","['chochorowski', 'kr', 'ƒñpiec']",4
102,"Decline and Extermination of an Arctic Wolf Population in East Greenland, 1899-1939 | The decline and extermination of an arctic wolf population in East Greenland between 1899 and 1939 were investigated through analysis of 40 years of archival data, which contained records of 252 sightings of wolves or their tracks. Prior to the start of exploitation by Europeans, this small, isolated wolf population probably consisted of about 38 wolves during an average year. Of 112 wolves sighted in early winter, 31.3% were lone wolves, 23.2% were in pairs, and the rest were in larger groups. Mean pack size was 3.3 wolves, and packs of more than four wolves were rare. The population was concentrated in the central part of its range, making it vulnerable to exploitation by Danish and Norwegian commercial hunters, who exterminated the population. Poison was the primary agent of destruction. There was no evidence that other proposed causes of the decline were influential. This study provided the first evidence of an arctic wolf population that was eradicated and highlights the vulnerability of small, isolated wolf populations to excessive harvest. Wolves in the High Arctic may be particularly vulnerable because of their exceptionally low densities, smaller pack sizes, lower pup production, infrequent reproduction, and insular or disjunct distributions. | ['marquard', 'petersen'] | ","['marquard', 'petersen']",1
103,"Dendrochronological Studies of Wood at Historically Significant Sites of the Arctic | Studies of wood in the Arctic were carried out on Vaygach Island, Hooker Island (FranzJoseph Land) and Novaya Zemlya. During the expedition ‚ÄúArctic Floating University -2013‚Äù, wood samples (cores) were taken from the buildings in key areas of the Arctic islands. Conforming to the wood samples we constructed tree-ring series and obtained floating chronologies, which were linked to dendroscales of standing trees with known year of each annual ring formation. Crossdating of floating chronologies was performed as follows. Dendroscale and floating chronology were overlapped and the synchronicity coefficient was calculated, then the dendroscale was shifted for a year and the coefficient was calculated again; the procedure was repeated until all possible options were checked. Visual similarity was assessed and the annual rings of floating chronology were dated based on the results with the maximum synchronicity coefficient, and the object was dated by the outermost ring. The year of formation of each annual ring of the buildings logs was determined by the dendrochronological method, resulting in assumption of the time of their construction, taking into account that it occurred a year or two after the tree felling. All the studied objects were located in areas with preserved history of their creation, which is highly important for confirming the objectivity of the obtained results. The dates of the buildings were determined as follows: Vaigach Island, 1945; Hooker Island (Franz Josef Land), 1936; the former bathhouse on Cape Zhelaniya (Novaya Zemlya), 1935; timber from the pillbox, 1938; the lighthouse, 1952; the frame on the coast of Ledyanaya Gavan‚Äô Bay (Novaya Zemlya), 1938; a relatively modern building on the coast of the bay, 1991. Interesting to note that according to the obtained historical records the Lighthouse was built in year 1954, while dating by annual rings shows that the logs were in 1952 and they were probably imported in advance. The years for the construction research based on the use of the dendrochronological method opens up great opportunities at determining the age of unnamed wooden in the Arctic. –ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã –≤ –ê—Ä–∫—Ç–∏–∫–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –Ω–∞ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ö –í–∞–π–≥–∞—á, –ì—É–∫–∫–µ—Ä–∞ (–ó–µ–º–ª—è –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∞-–ò–æ—Å–∏—Ñ–∞) –∏ –ù–æ–≤–æ–π –ó–µ–º–ª–µ. –í —Ö–æ–¥–µ —ç–∫—Å–ø–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–∏ ¬´–ê—Ä–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–ª–∞–≤—É—á–∏–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç - 2013¬ª –±—ã–ª–∏ –≤–∑—è—Ç—ã –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü—ã –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã (–∫–µ—Ä–Ω—ã) –∏–∑ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞ –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤—ã—Ö —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞—Ö –∞—Ä–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–æ–≤. –ü–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–∞–º –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏–ª–∏ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ-–∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–µ–≤—ã–µ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏ –∏ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª–∏ ¬´–ø–ª–∞–≤–∞—é—â–∏–µ —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏¬ª, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ ¬´–ø—Ä–∏–≤—è–∑—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏¬ª –∫ –¥–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ—à–∫–∞–ª–∞–º —Ä–∞—Å—Ç—É—â–∏—Ö –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ —Å –∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–º –≥–æ–¥–æ–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞. –ü–µ—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø–ª–∞–≤–∞—é—â–∏—Ö —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–π –æ—Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–ª—è–ª–∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º. –î–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ—à–∫–∞–ª—É –∏ –ø–ª–∞–≤–∞—é—â—É—é —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—é –Ω–∞–∫–ª–∞–¥—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥ –Ω–∞ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏ –∫–æ—ç—Ñ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç —Å–∏–Ω—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –∑–∞—Ç–µ–º —Å–¥–≤–∏–≥–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ 1 –≥–æ–¥ –∏ —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏, –∏ —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–¥–≤–∏–≥–∞–ª–∏ –∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–±–∏—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –≤—Å–µ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∞—Ä–∏–∞–Ω—Ç—ã. –ü–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–º —Å –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ—ç—Ñ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º —Å–∏–Ω—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏ –≤–∏–∑—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å—Ö–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞ –ø–ª–∞–≤–∞—é—â–µ–π —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏, –∞ –ø–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–º—É –Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–Ω–æ–º—É –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü—É –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç. –î–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–æ–º –±—ã–ª –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω –≥–æ–¥ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞ –±—Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–π, —á—Ç–æ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏–ª–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∏—Ö –≤–æ–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞—è, —á—Ç–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –≥–æ–¥-–¥–≤–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ä—É–±–∫–∏ –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–∞. –í—Å–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç—ã —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ö —Å —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–≤—à–µ–π—Å—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–µ–π –∏—Ö —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è, —á—Ç–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö. –í —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã –¥–∞—Ç—ã —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞: –Ω–∞ –æ-–≤–µ –í–∞–π–≥–∞—á —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä—É—é—Ç—Å—è 1945 –≥., –Ω–∞ –æ-–≤–µ –ì—É–∫–∫–µ—Ä–∞ (–ó–µ–º–ª—è –§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü–∞-–ò–æ—Å–∏—Ñ–∞) - –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∏ 1936 –≥., –±—ã–≤—à–∞—è –±–∞–Ω—è –Ω–∞ –º. –ñ–µ–ª–∞–Ω–∏—è (–ù–æ–≤–∞—è –ó–µ–º–ª—è) - 1935 –≥., —Å—Ä—É–± –¥–∑–æ—Ç–∞ (—Ç–∞–º –∂–µ) - 1938 –≥., –º–∞—è–∫ (—Ç–∞–º –∂–µ) - 1952 –≥., —Å—Ä—É–± –Ω–∞ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥—É –±—É—Ö. –õ–µ–¥—è–Ω–∞—è –ì–∞–≤–∞–Ω—å (–ù–æ–≤–∞—è –ó–µ–º–ª—è) - 1938 –≥., –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ ¬´—Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ¬ª —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ (—Ç–∞–º –∂–µ) –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è 1991 –≥. –î–∞—Ç–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –º–∞—è–∫–∞ –∏–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ - 1954 –≥., –∞ –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ–ª—å—Ü–∞–º –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –±—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∞ —Å—Ä—É–±–ª–µ–Ω—ã –≤ 1952 –≥. –∏, –≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–Ω–æ, –∑–∞–≤–µ–∑–µ–Ω—ã –∑–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–µ. –ü—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ –¥–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∞ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞ –±–µ–∑—ã–º—è–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—è–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –ê—Ä–∫—Ç–∏–∫–µ. | ['byzova', 'feklistov', 'pashkevich', 'sazanova', 'sobolev'] | ","['byzova', 'feklistov', 'pashkevich', 'sazanova', 'sobolev']",3

105,"Description of a new species in the genus Bythotrephes Leydig, 1860 (Crustacea: Cladocera: Onychopoda), supplements to selected species, and concluding remarks on the genus | A new species of the genus Bvthotrephes is described based on material collected in the mountain lakes of Tyva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia). The representatives of the new species are especially close to those of B. longimanus having long tl I, straight caudal process, and only two pairs of claws on postabdomen and caudal process, respectively. At the same time, the new species is, on average, smaller with shorter caudal process and fairly long apical setae of second endopodital segment of the thoracic limbs of first pair (t11). Supplemental data on morphology, taxonomy, and geographic distribution of other species of the genus, e.g., B. arcticus, B. cederstrOmil, B. brevimanus, and B. lilheborgi, are presented. For B. cederstromil, in particular, females of first generation hatched from resting eggs are described for the first time. Classification of the genus is discussed and an updated key for species and a hybrid form is presented. The highest species richness of the genus, observed within the Scandinavian Peninsula and in the north of European Russia, may indicate the central region of primly speciation which generally coincides with the region of the last Quaternary maximum glaciation. The isolated occurrence of three species, B. longimanus, B. transcaucasicus, and B. centralasiaticus sp. nov. on the southern border of the genus' range, in pre-Alpine and mountain lakes of Europe. Transcaucasia, and Southern Siberia (Tyva) and isolated localities of B. arcticus in Northern Kazakhstan, could also be due to the effect of glaciation(s). Regarding the origin of the genus Bythotrephes, it is hypothesized that it occurred in pre -Pleistocene time in the ancient Ponto-Caspian basin, experiencing large-scale transgressions, where the intensive radiation of ancestral Onychopoda probably took place. | ['korovchinsky'] | ",['korovchinsky'],4
106,"Detecting the medieval cod trade: a new method and first results | This paper explores the potential of stable isotope analysis to identify the approximate region of catch of cod by analysing bones from medieval settlements in northern and western Europe. It measures the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of cod bone collagen from medieval control samples collected from sites around Arctic Norway, the North Sea, the Kattegat and the Baltic Sea. These data were considered likely to differ by region due to, for example, variation in the length of the food chain, water temperature and salinity. We find that geographical structuring is indeed evident, making it possible to identify bones from cod caught in distant waters. These results provide a new methodology for studying the growth of long-range trade in dried cod and the related expansion of fishing effort-important aspects of the development of commercialisation in medieval Europe. As a first test of the method, we analyse three collections of cod bones tentatively interpreted as imported dried fish based on a priori zooarchaeological criteria. The results tentatively suggest that cod were being transported or traded over very long distances since the end of the first millennium AD. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

108,"Development and application of a lichenometric dating curve, Brooks Range, Alaska | Searches of bouldery Holocene moraines fronting small cirque glaciers in the arctic and alpine terrain of the central Brooks Range reveal patterns of selected lichen species consistent on the basis of maximum thallus diameters. These patterns show close parallelism to ridges marking successive ice-marginal positions. They have been mapped along with lichen trimline and density data as isophyses or graphed as frequency distributions to yield relative ages and modes of movement for over 50 glaciers. Absolute ages have been derived through development of a lichen growth curve based largely on the commonly used species Rhizocarpon geographicum s.l., and the fast-growing Alectoria minuscula/pubescens. We have computed surface ice velocity by measuring lichens along 1200 m of a supraglacial boulder train. A regional synthesis of data suggests a complex glacial chronology involving seven periods of expansion during the past 4500 yr BP. -from Authors | ['calkin', 'elli'] | ","['calkin', 'elli']",0
109,Development of bogs in a coast-inland transect in northern Norway | Bio- and litho-stratigraphy of eight ombrotrophic bogs and one fen in a 76 km long transect from coast to the interior of the district of Troms were studied. The general mode of development of a bog was from an initial carr or swamp forest via a more or less open Cyperaceae-Amblystegiaceae fen to an open Ericaceae-Sphagnum bog with hummocks and hollows. The most marked litho- and biostratigraphical changes concentrated about 2750 14C-years BP (2855 cal. years BP). Transition to ombrotrophic environments normally occurred with some time lag after a climatically induced lithostratigraphical change. This lithostratigraphical transition most frequently occurred during the time interval 3355-2760 BP. The oldest date of the transition was 4465 BP and the youngest (interpolated) date 2400 BP. | ['vorren'] | ,['vorren'],1

113,"Diet and Habitat of Mountain Woodland Caribou Inferred from Dung Preserved in 5000-year-old Alpine Ice in the Selwyn Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada | Alpine ice patches are unique repositories of cryogenically preserved archaeological artefacts and biological specimens. Recent melting of ice in the Selwyn Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada, has exposed layers of dung accumulated during seasonal use of ice patches by mountain woodland caribou of the ancestral Redstone population over the past ca. 5250 years. Although attempts to isolate the DNA of known caribou parasites were unsuccessful, the dung has yielded numerous well-preserved and diverse plant remains and palynomorphs. Plant remains preserved in dung suggest that the ancestral Redstone caribou population foraged on a variety of lichens (30%), bryophytes and lycopods (26.7%), shrubs (21.6%), grasses (10.5%), sedges (7.8%), and forbs (3.4%) during summer use of alpine ice. Dung palynomorph assemblages depict a mosaic of plant communities growing in the caribou's summer habitat, including downslope boreal components and upslope floristically diverse herbaceous communities. Pollen and spore content of dung is only broadly similar to late Holocene assemblages preserved in lake sediments and peat in the study region, and differences are likely due to the influence of local vegetation and animal forage behaviour. The 5000-year legacy of summer use of alpine ice patches by mountain woodland caribou suggests that these small, long-lived features may be important for the health of caribou populations in the Selwyn/Mackenzie Mountain range. | ['adamczewski', 'andrew', 'bowyer', 'galloway', 'kutz', 'mackay', 'meulendyk', 'moorman', 'schock'] | ","['adamczewski', 'andrew', 'bowyer', 'galloway', 'kutz', 'mackay', 'meulendyk', 'moorman', 'schock']",4
114,"Dietary evenness, prey choice, and human-environment interactions | Although measures of evenness of archaeological faunas are increasingly used in zooarchaeological analyses, the widely accepted hypothesis that increasing evenness should indicate increasing dietary breadth has not been tested. In this paper, I examine three factors that can contribute to changing evenness values-changing encounter rates with high-ranked prey types, changing diet breadth, and similarity between the return rates of the highest-ranked resources-and discuss ways of controlling the latter two factors. I then test the ""evenness hypothesis"" using ethnographic data collected by Smith (E.A. Smith, Evolutionary Ecology and the Analysis of Human Foraging Behavior: An Inuit Example from the East Coast of Hudson Bay, Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University, 1980, E.A. Smith, Inujjamiut Foraging Strategies: Evolutionary Ecology of an Arctic Hunting Economy, Aldine de Gruyter, Hawthorne, NY, 1991) in Inukjuak, northern Canada. Although the results support the evenness hypothesis, they also show that the nature of archaeological data may make evenness measures difficult to use accurately. Evenness can be used to understand changing prehistoric encounter rates with prey, but many conditions must be met for it to do so. | ['jones'] | ",['jones'],4
115,"Dietary plasticity and the extinction of the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) | The decline of passenger pigeons (Ectopistes migratorius) during the late nineteenth century continues to draw substantial public and scientific attention as perhaps the most (in-)famous extinction event in North America's recent history. While humans undeniably caused the extinction, the relative importance of indirect (habitat destruction) versus direct (overhunting) impacts has remained a mystery, in part, due to a lack of scientific evidence for critical aspects of the species' dietary ecology. One key factor in explaining why passenger pigeons went extinct is that their highly specialized diet and foraging strategy, focusing on mast (tree nuts), were no longer feasible as the forested habitats that they depended on became depleted by deforestation. We used stable isotope ([delta]13C and [delta]15N, n = 94) and ancient DNA (n = 9) analyses of archaeological specimens to demonstrate that, during the later Holocene, passenger pigeons had a substantial degree of dietary plasticity (including some individuals specializing in consumption of agricultural crops) that could have allowed them to take advantage of other food opportunities when mast became scarce. Dietary variation is not linked with either biological age (juveniles versus adults) or haplogroup. These results suggest that habitat destruction was less important for the passenger pigeon's extinction than the impacts of hunting and trapping and highlight the tremendous potential of the archaeological record for exploring the factors that led to this species' extinction.

Indirect lines of evidence, such as lipid isotopic ratios of pottery residues, faunal mortality profiles, and lactase persistence allele frequencies, provide a partial picture of this process; however, in order to understand how, where, and when humans consumed milk products, it is necessary to link evidence of consumption directly to individuals and their dairy livestock. Here we report the first direct evidence of milk consumption, the whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), preserved in human dental calculus from the Bronze Age (ca. 3000 BCE) to the present day. Using protein tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that BLG is a species-specific biomarker of dairy consumption, and we identify individuals consuming cattle, sheep, and goat milk products in the archaeological record. We then apply this method to human dental calculus from Greenland's medieval Norse colonies, and report a decline of this biomarker leading up to the abandonment of the Norse Greenland colonies in the 15th century CE. | ['arneborg', 'bouwman', 'canci', 'cappellini', 'charlton', 'christensen', 'collins', 'craig', 'fiddyment', 'fischer', 'fotakis', 'gilbert', 'hendy', 'liebert', 'lynnerup', 'mackie', 'montalva', 'olsen', 'ruehli', 'speller', 'swallow', 'trachsel', 'warinner'] | ","['arneborg', 'bouwman', 'canci', 'cappellini', 'charlton', 'christensen', 'collins', 'craig', 'fiddyment', 'fischer', 'fotakis', 'gilbert', 'hendy', 'liebert', 'lynnerup', 'mackie', 'montalva', 'olsen', 'ruehli', 'speller', 'swallow', 'trachsel', 'warinner']",4
117,"Disappearance of Icelandic Walruses Coincided with Norse Settlement | There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the impacts of human arrival in new ""pristine"" environments, including terrestrial habitat alterations and species extinctions. However, the effects of marine resource utilization prior to industrialized whaling, sealing, and fishing have largely remained understudied. The expansion of the Norse across the North Atlantic offers a rare opportunity to study the effects of human arrival and early exploitation of marine resources. Today, there is no local population of walruses on Iceland, however, skeletal remains, place names, and written sources suggest that walruses existed, and were hunted by the Norse during the Settlement and Commonwealth periods (870-1262 AD). This study investigates the timing, geographic distribution, and genetic identity of walruses in Iceland by combining historical information, place names, radiocarbon dating, and genomic analyses. The results support a genetically distinct, local population of walruses that went extinct shortly after Norse settlement. The high value of walrus products such as ivory on international markets likely led to intense hunting pressure, which-potentially exacerbated by a warming climate and volcanism-resulted in the extinction of walrus on Iceland. We show that commercial hunting, economic incentives, and trade networks as early as the Viking Age were of sufficient scale and intensity to result in significant, irreversible ecological impacts on the marine environment. This is to one of the earliest examples of local extinction of a marine species following human arrival, during the very beginning of commercial marine exploitation. | ['einarsson', 'fernandez', 'coll', 'jordan', 'keighley', 'malmquist', 'olsen', 'palsson', 'petersen'] | ","['einarsson', 'fernandez', 'coll', 'jordan', 'keighley', 'malmquist', 'olsen', 'palsson', 'petersen']",1
118,"The Dispersal of Woody Plants Their Migration Potentialities and Bio Geographic Interpretation of the Events of the Quaternary | On the basis of the estimated data on the migration potentialities of woody plants, a conclusion was made on the low rates of the distribution of woody, particulary broad-leaved species, whereas the supposition on the repeated far-distant migrations of the vegetation during the relatively short interglacial and postglacial periods proved to be erroneous. The calculations were carried out according to the formula: W = S/A, in which S is the most effective distance of species dispersal, and A is the least period of generation succession. Apparently, the paleogeographical situation in the Quaternary differs from what is commonly believed. Gradual (without catastrophies) vegetational changes seem to have been caused by sea transgressions and temperature fall resulting from the subarctic and montane glaciations. Evidently, only similar situations could favor the preservation of refuges of forest vegetation with the Tertiary relicts and endemic plant species on the territory from Volyno-Podoliya [USSR] up to Scandinavia inclusive. | ['udra'] | ",['udra'],1
119,"Distal cryptotephra found in a Viking boathouse: the potential for tephrochronology in reconstructing the Iron Age in Norway | Distal tephra deposits from Icelandic volcanic eruptions have been found in Norway and can be used to precisely date a variety of sedimentary environments. Tephrochronology has not yet been applied to archaeological investigations in Norway because tephra are generally not found as visible layers, but are present as very low concentrations of glass shards (i.e. cryptotephra). In this study, we present results from the analysis of cryptotephras found in an Iron Age boathouse in northern Norway. The boathouse was associated with the chieftain center at Borg on Vestvagoy in the Lofoten Islands. In 2003, a trench was excavated and the stratigraphy of the boathouse was described. Radiocarbon ages from cultural deposits show that it was constructed in the Early Iron Age c. AD 540-660 and the main period of use was at the end of the Iron Age between c. AD 1030 and AD 1270. Volcanic glass shards were isolated from sediment samples collected above and below the cultural deposit representing the main period of use. Electron microprobe analysis of the glass shards showed that the lower sample resembles the AD 860 Layer B tephra and the upper sample resembles tephra erupted from the Hekla volcanic system between AD 1104 and AD 1300. These tephrochronologic dates agree with the radiocarbon-derived dates and possibly further constrain the boathouse's main period of use to c. AD 1030-1104. Our results demonstrate the value of using tephrochronology for archaeological studies in Norway and the potential for finding cryptotephra from other large explosive volcanic eruptions during the Iron Age.

121,"Distribution of the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) in an urban environment using environmental DNA | The boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) is at risk of extinction in parts of its range in Canada. Our objectives were to quantify the influence of local and landscape characteristics on the occurrence of the species in wetlands in southern Qu√©bec. We hypothesized that site occupancy depends on local characteristics and landscape characteristics contributing to site connectivity. We developed an environmental DNA (eDNA) method to detect the species and compared the detection probability of this method to traditional call surveys. We collected water samples from a total of 180 sites (90 in 2017, 110 in 2018), whereas we surveyed a subset of 63 sites using both eDNA and call surveys in 2018. Site occupancy varied across years, but was higher in sites where the species had been previously detected during the last 12¬†years by other studies. Site occupancy did not vary with other local and landscape characteristics, in part due to an apparent decrease in the number of sites occupied by the species since the last 12¬†years. Detection probability via eDNA (0.81; 95% CI: [0.31; 0.98]) did not differ from that of call surveys (0.62; 95% CI: [0.25; 0.89]). To identify the optimal sampling period for the boreal chorus frog, future studies should estimate the detection probability of eDNA during the breeding season and the larval development period of the species. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

122,"Holocene Distributions and Extinctions of Ungulates in Northern Eurasia | The paper examines the previously published and original information on Holocene distributions and extinctions of the ungulates in northern Eurasia, with emphasis on the region lying within the Russian Federation. Our analysis of faunal and radiocarbon data on the wild horse (Equus ferus Boddaert), the European ass (Equus hydruntinus Regalia), the giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus Blumenbach), the steppe bison (Bison priscus Bojanus), the musk ox (Ovibos moschatus Zimmermann) and the auroch (Bos primigenius Bojanus) allows for changes in the species ranges to be traced throughout the Holocene. Extinction processes are shown to have had spatial and temporal differences. The spread of closed forest in the beginning of the Holocene led to local extinctions or significant range declines of the wild horse and the steppe bison. Regional extinctions of the wild horse eventually resulted in range disruptions. Since the Neolithic period, the wild horse distribution was mostly restricted to the Eurasian steppe and forested steppe zones, although isolated horse populations survived in Arctic Siberia until 2 kyr BP. Changes in vegetation and the destruction of suitable habitats led to range fragmentations and local extirpations of the giant deer and the European ass. Both these species became extinct in the area during the Neolithic period. The Holocene distribution of the musk ox was restricted to the Arctic region. The extinction of the wild horse and the auroch occurred during the historical era and was caused by direct and indirect human activities such as hunting and agriculture. | ['devjashin', 'gasilin', 'kosintsev', 'plasteeva'] | ","['devjashin', 'gasilin', 'kosintsev', 'plasteeva']",1
123,"Distribution and Frequency of Snow-Avalanche Debris Transfer in the Distal Part of Colluvial Cones in Central North Iceland | This paper emphasizes the importance of studying diffuse rock debris accumulation in the far distal part of colluvial cones with the aim of defining the spatial distribution and frequency of extreme snow avalanches. These deposits are located at some distance from the slope and have rarely been described in the literature. The field based methods used in this study confirm the snow-avalanche origin of these deposits by (i) characterizing the distribution of the deposits along the colluvial cones and to their furthest extent, some way from the foot of the slope, and (ii) clearly defining the orientation of the long axis of the furthest and largest boulders as parallel with the main cone axis. A relative age of the deposits is obtained by assessing the vegetation cover of the boulder surfaces and by measuring the rock hardness using a Schmidt hammer. The study concludes that there were frequent extreme snow avalanches which have occurred since the Little Ice Age, and that they have decreased in magnitude during the past decade. | ['decaulne', 'saemundsson'] | ","['decaulne', 'saemundsson']",1

129,"Dmanissi Man (Homo Georgicus), 1.810.000 years ago | Excavation carried out since 1991 at the open-air site of Dmanissi, Georgia, have yielded four craniums, three mandibles, about 15 postcranial remains and a dozen isolated teeth. These remains correspond to at least four individuals, two adults and two adolescents. They were excavated from a precise stratigraphic, palaeontological and archaeological context above a basalt flow dated by K/Ar between 1.8 and 1.9 ¬± 0.01¬†Ma in a volcanic ash layer dated by 40Ar/39Ar to 1.80 ¬± 0.05¬†Ma. The interest of these discoveries is fourfold: -¬†(1) the dates obtained by diverse radiochronometric methods and by palaeomagnetism demonstrate, for the first time, that Man was present at the gates of Europe, in Transcaucasia at a much earlier period than that established by the classical scenario; -¬†(2) faunal and pollens analyses have revealed that the environment was close to a savannah type, but much richer in water resources than the African environment. It was a temperate climate, with a mosaic of different landscapes due to the geomorphological diversity of the region, made up of valleys, lakes and the nearby mountains of the Great and Small Caucasus; -¬†(3) the settlement of this human group could have been a direct consequence of a more humid environment, which followed a generalised aridification of the East of Georgia at the end of the Pliocene and which attracted fauna from both the East of the Eurasian continent and the North of the African continent; -¬†(4) the morphofunctional aspects of these humans are close to those of Homo habilis and to those of the most archaic Homo erectus, which were the only species known in Africa up until now. Ascribed to a new species, Homo georgicus, small in size measuring 1.5¬†m with a cranial capacity of 600 to 700¬†cm3 (half of modern man's capacity), they represent the ancestors of a long European or Eurasian lineage. Two new concepts can be retained: -¬†the exodus from Africa took place earlier than previously thought, dating back to at least 1.8¬†Myr ago. It was carried out by Homo georgicus, a group close to Homo habilis; -¬†it is no longer valid to base explanations of Man's migratory capacity in terms of cranial development. Homo georgicus, with a small brain volume, already had the faculty to adapt to a more favourable environment for his survival. To cite this article: M.-A.¬†de¬†Lumley, D.¬†Lordkipanidze, C.¬†R.

130,"DNA from fossils: The past and the future | The recovery of DNA from archaeological and palaeontological remains has intrigued scientists for many years. The DNA molecule is a relatively weak molecule compared with other biomacromolecules in tissues, but the sequence of its bases holds insights into questions that cannot be resolved by standard palaeontological methods. Recent advances in the field, such as the recovery of DNA sequences from coprolites found in the southwestern USA, as well as from the Neanderthal-type specimen, have shed new light on populations that are now extinct. A better understanding of how DNA is preserved in fossils, as well as the use of novel agents that can release the DNA from archaeological and palaeontological materials, will likely lead to new successes in the field. The analysis of ancient DNA may provide new clues about human evolution and answer questions, for example, relating to the diversity of the Neanderthals and the mammoths. | ['poinar'] | ",['poinar'],4
131,"Further documentation supporting the former existence of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in northern Quebec-Labrador | The discovery in 1976 of a grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) skull in an 18th-century Labrador Inuit midden effectively ended speculation about the former existence of the species in the barrenlands of northern Quebec and Labrador. We analyzed a photograph of a bear skull taken in 1910 at an Innu camp in the Labrador interior (east of the George River), which appears to be that of a grizzly bear. Coupled with previously unpublished historical accounts by Lucien Turner (Smithsonian naturalist in northern Quebec, 1881-83) and William Duncan Strong (anthropologist in Labrador, 1928-29), Innu oral history accounts, and archaeological evidence, this photograph further substantiates the theory that a small number of grizzly bears were present in the Quebec-Labrador peninsula and survived into the 20th century. | ['loring', 'spy'] | ","['loring', 'spy']",0
132,"Dog Remains from a Paleoeskimo Settlement in West Greenland | In 1982, a large number of well preserved bones were excavated at the Eskimo site of Qaja, Jakobshavn Icefjord, West Greenland (Meldgaard 1983). Based on the implements found, the main part of the deposit was formed during Sarqaq time. According to C-14 datings, this period at Qaja started in 1975 B.C. and continued to 925 B.C. A sample of some 15,000 bones from this period is discussed in this paper. A preliminary hand sorting and examination of the bones were carried out at the site in order to ascertain the total number of bones as well as the primary species exploited. From the list of species present, it appears that the settlement population depended most heavily upon seals. The 18 bones of dog (Canis familiaris) are the first proof of this animal's existence in Paleoeskimo times, which carries the dog back another 3000 years in time. | ['mohl'] | ",['mohl'],0
133,"Dorset Pre-Inuit and Beothuk foodways in Newfoundland, ca. AD 500-1829 | Archaeological research on the Canadian island of Newfoundland increasingly demonstrates that the island's subarctic climate and paucity of terrestrial food resources did not restrict past Pre-Inuit (Dorset) and Native American (Beothuk) hunter-gatherer populations to a single subsistence pattern. This study first sought to characterize hunter-gatherer diets over the past 1500 years; and second, to assess the impact of European colonization on Beothuk lifeways by comparing the bone chemistry of Beothuk skeletal remains before and after the intensification of European settlement in the early 18th century. We employed radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio analysis of bulk bone collagen from both Dorset (n = 9) and Beothuk (n = 13) cultures, including a naturally mummified 17th century Beothuk individual. Carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of 108 faunal samples from Dorset and Beothuk archaeological sites around the island were used as a dietary baseline for the humans. We combined our results with previously published isotope data and radiocarbon dates from Dorset (n = 12) and Beothuk (n = 18) individuals and conducted a palaeodietary analysis using Bayesian modelling, cluster analysis and comparative statistical tests. Dorset diets featured more marine protein than those of the Beothuk, and the diets of Beothuk after the 18th century featured less high trophic level marine protein than those of individuals pre-dating the 18th century. Despite inhabiting the same island, Dorset and Beothuk cultures employed markedly different dietary strategies, consistent with interpretations of other archaeological data. Significantly, European colonization had a profound effect on Beothuk lifeways, as in response to the increasing European presence on the coast, the Beothuk relied more extensively on the limited resources of the island's boreal forests and rivers. | ['duggan', 'fuller', 'grime', 'harris', 'marciniak', 'marshall', 'poinar', 'southon'] | ","['duggan', 'fuller', 'grime', 'harris', 'marciniak', 'marshall', 'poinar', 'southon']",1
134,"Holocene driftwood incursion to southwestern Victoria Island, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and its significance to paleoceanography and archaeology | Holocene driftwood is found on postglacial raised beaches of Wollaston Peninsula, Victoria Island. The highest driftwood appears on the 12- to 13-m beach, which formed about 4000 yr B.P., and is common on beaches 12-6 m in elevation. The earliest Paleoeskimo dwelling features also occur on the 12- to 13-m beach. Wood increases on the 5- to 6-m beach, which formed about 2000 yr B.P., and is abundant below that level. Thus, zonation of wood suggests the following hypotheses: (1) that the coastal Mackenzie Current, the source of modern driftwood, did not operate before 4000 yr B.P. and lacked its present vigor or persistence until 2000 yr B.P.; and (2) that the apparent sudden influx of driftwood at 4000 yr B.P. may have provided a fuel resource and (or) may have been related to conditions that enabled first peopling. Radiocarbon ages indicate that (1) the first wood arrived about 4700 yr B.P.; (2) little wood arrived from 4700-2000 yr B.P.; and (3) influx of wood was episodic after 2000 yr B.P. Much of the wood that arrived after 1100 yr B.P. was redistributed by people and scattered on higher beaches. Explanation of the evident correlation between highest wood and highest dwelling features must await archaeological studies. | ['dyke', 'savelle'] | ","['dyke', 'savelle']",4
135,"Holocene dwarf mammoths from Wrangle Islands in the Siberian Arctic | The cause of extinction of the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius (Blumenbach), is still debated. A major environmental change at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, hunting by early man, or both together are among the main explanations that have been suggested. But hardly anyone has doubted that mammoths had become extinct everywhere by around 9,500 years before present (BP). We report here new discoveries on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean that force this view to be revised. Along with normal-sized mammoth fossils dating to the end of the Pleistocene, numerous teeth of dwarf mammoth dated 7,000-4,000 yr BP have been found there. The island is thought to have become separated from the mainland by 12,000 yr BP. Survival of a mammoth population may be explained by local topography and climatic features, which permitted relictual preservaiton of communities of steppe plants. We interpret the dwarfing of the Wrangle mammoths as a result of the insularity effect, combined with a response to the general trend towards unfavourable environment in the Holocene. | ['garutt', 'sher', 'vartanyan'] | ","['garutt', 'sher', 'vartanyan']",4
136,"Dynamics of Fish Catches in Ancient Aleuts on Adak Island (Aleutian Islands, Alaska) in the Middle and Late Holocene | The results of identifying the fish remains from two archaeological sites on Adak Island (Aleutian Islands, Alaska) are represented. The main objectives were to determine the main fish groups in catches of ancient Aleuts and temporal dynamics of their relative abundance and individual size. Settlers of an ancient settlement on the Clam Lagoon coast (archaeological site ADK-171, circa 6500 cal. years BP) caught greenlings (Hexagrammos sp.) and small-scale gadids, mainly saffron cod (Eleginus gracils). Owing to changes in the substrate of the Clam Lagoon, the share of flatfish in catches became higher. No dynamics in the shares of greenlings and saffron cods were observed. Ancient Aleuts from the settlement in the Sweeper Cove (1400-200 cal. years BP) also caught greenlings and gadids, mainly large Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus). During this period, the shares of Pacific cod in the catches significantly decreased; on the contrary, those of greenlings increased. A relative abundance of Pacific cod in the Sweeper Cove region grew also during the period studied, and the relative abundance of greenlings was reduced. All changes in shares and relative abundance coincided with the main climatic shifts in the North Pacific region. The intense fishing of greenlings affected the local greenling population during the existence of the settlement in the Sweeper Cove region. | ['krylovich', 'savinetsky', 'savinetsky'] | ","['krylovich', 'savinetsky', 'savinetsky']",4
137,"Early Holocene Dog Bones from the Zhokhov Site (East Siberian Arctic) and the Question of the Reliability of Identification of Early <i>Canis familiaris</i> from Archaeological Excavations | Excavations of the Zhokhov site yielded small, but significant collection of canid bone remains (MNI=13) dating from the early Holocene. To clarify the characteristics of their cranial morphology we compared them with recent wolf skulls from the eastern Siberia. We conclude that the canid remains from the Zhokhov site belong to a well-shaped breed of Canis familiaris that existed in Arctic Siberia ca. 8000 <sup>14 </sup>C bp and was widely used by people as hunting and draught dogs. Presence of dog teams in the culture of Zhokhov hunters is a firmly established fact. The morphological study of fossil dog remains from the Zhokhov site shows that there is a reliable and universal criterion to distinguish between wolf and primitive (wolf-like) dogs. The difference is easy to find through comparison of two proportional indices of the dog/wolf skull. The first of these indices is a ratio between the skull height at postorbital constriction and the basal length of the skull, and the second is a ratio between the snout height at Pm<sup>1</sup>-Pm<sup>2</sup> and the basal skull length. It can be hypothesized that dog teams might have been used in Siberia as early as 15,000 years ago. The evolution of Canis familiaris seems to have included the following stages: 1) natural selection through feeding behavior in a specific ecological niche formed as a result of human activity; 2) artificial selection for domesticability (tolerance to human beings, etc.); 3) controlled selection aimed at shaping the breeds possessing diverse qualities answering specific cultural and economic needs and functions. –í —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ —Ä–∞—Å–∫–æ–ø–æ–∫ –Ω–∞ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ –ñ–æ—Ö–æ–≤–∞ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è, –Ω–æ –≤—ã—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è –∫–æ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤ —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∏ —Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–µ–≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞ (MNI=13). –î–ª—è –≤—ã—è—Å–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–æ—Ä—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —á–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–≤ –∂–æ—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ–±–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–æ –∏—Ö —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å —Ä–µ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç–Ω—ã–º–∏ —á–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∞–º–∏ –≤–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏. –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –ñ–æ—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∫–µ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 8000 <sup>14</sup>–° –ª.–Ω. –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –≤–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ —Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–≤—à–∞—è—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –≤–∏–¥ –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—è—è —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞, –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–≤—à–∞—è—Å—è –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏ –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–µ –∏ –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ —Ç—è–≥–ª–æ–≤–æ–π —Å–∏–ª—ã. –ù–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–µ –≤ —ç—Ç–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–µ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–æ–π —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã —É–ø—Ä—è–∂–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ç–≤—ë—Ä–¥–æ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ–º. –ù–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —Å–æ–±–∞–∫ –∏–∑ –ñ–æ—Ö–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∫–∏ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–¥—ë–∂–Ω—ã–º –∏ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–µ–º –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —á–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–≤ –≤–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤ –∏ —Å–æ–±–∞–∫ –≤–æ–ª–∫–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–≤—É—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–ø–æ—Ä—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–Ω–¥–µ–∫—Å–æ–≤ (–∏–Ω–¥–µ–∫—Å–∞ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π –¥–ª–∏–Ω–µ –≤—ã—Å–æ—Ç—ã —á–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∞ –≤ –∫—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –∏–Ω–¥–µ–∫—Å–∞ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫ –Ω–µ–π –∂–µ –≤—ã—Å–æ—Ç—ã –º–æ—Ä–¥—ã –Ω–∞ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ Pm<sup>1</sup>-Pm<sup>2</sup>). –í—ã–¥–≤–∏–≥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ–º –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –µ–∑–¥–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Å–æ–±–∞–∫ –≤ –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 15000 –ª.–Ω. –≠–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è <i>Canis familiaris</i> –æ—Ç –æ–±—â–µ–≥–æ —Å —Å–µ—Ä—ã–º –≤–æ–ª–∫–æ–º –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞–ª–∞, –ø–æ-–≤–∏–¥–∏–º–æ–º—É, –≤ —Ç—Ä–∏ —ç—Ç–∞–ø–∞, –∏ –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞–ª–∞ –≤ —Å–µ–±—è —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–µ —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–∏: 1) –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –ø–∏—â–µ–≤–æ–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –Ω–∏—à–∏, —Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≤ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞; 2) –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä –ø–æ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∫ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—é; 3) –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å–µ–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è —Å —Ü–µ–ª—å—é —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥, –Ω–∞–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–º –Ω–∞–±–æ—Ä–æ–º –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤, –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º—ã—Ö –¥–ª—è –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏—Ö —Å —Ç–æ–π –∏–ª–∏ –∏–Ω–æ–π —Ü–µ–ª—å—é –≤ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ. | ['kasparov', 'pitulko'] | ","['kasparov', 'pitulko']",3
138,"An Early Inupiaq Occupation: Observations on a Thule House From Cape Espenberg, Alaska | This paper describes and interprets a well-preserved early Thule semi-subterranean dwelling from Cape Espenberg, Alaska. The house architecture is similar in many respects to other early Thule dwellings with a sub-rectangular main room, long sunken entrance tunnel, and associated kitchen area. However, the presence of narrow side benches and associated flooring differences adds significantly to the variability present in Thule house form. Radiocarbon dates indicate occupations spanning 1300 to 1450 cal CE. Wood analysis suggests that the house underwent at least one rebuilding episode, which seems to have extended the house occupation into the early 15th century. People acquired mostly small seals for their subsistence, but supplemented their diets in the spring and fall with migrating birds, fish, terrestrial mammals, and other marine mammals. This house represents a fairly typical early Thule coastal winter occupation, but careful excavation of a well-preserved house reveals interesting details in house form, wood use, and subsistence patterns. | ['alix', 'friesen', 'mason', 'norman', 'orourke'] | ","['alix', 'friesen', 'mason', 'norman', 'orourke']",4

141,"The ecological role and geography of reindeer (rangifer tarandus) in Northern Eurasia | The reindeer is a ruminant of the family Cervidae with a circumpolar distribution that has been a key component of Eurasian high latitude ecosystems for at least 2 million years. Interactions with humans date from the late Pleistocene onward and wild and semi-domestic animals continue to be highly valued by aboriginal and non-native peoples for a diversity of purposes. As a widespread and dominant ungulate across many tundra and taiga regions, the reindeer exerts a number of important controls on ecosystem structure and function. Animals, both free-ranging and herded, move seasonally between summer, winter and transitional spring/autumn habitats or 'pastures'. Their effects on vegetation and soils vary greatly in space and time depending on factors such as altitude/exposure, snow depth, substrate, moisture, prevailing vegetation type and, most importantly, animal density. At present, the number of Old World reindeer is somewhat less than 2.5 million. The most productive semi-domestic herds occur in Fennoscandia and the Nenets regions of northwest Russia straddling the Ural Mountains. Management systems differ within and among countries and regions. Given the diverse suite of factors involved, changes in vegetation associated with grazing and trampling can be remarkably heterogeneous spatially yet remain to a large extent predictable. Potential threats facing reindeer populations of Eurasia include rapid land use change, climate change and ongoing institutional conflicts. ¬© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. | ['forbes', 'kumpula'] | ","['forbes', 'kumpula']",1
142,"Economic activity of the Berezov posad population in the 17th-18th centuries (on the basis of osteological materials from excavation site No. 2) | Berezov is one of the first Russian towns in the north of Western Siberia (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area). This article is aimed at describing the household structure, the commercial activities of the population inhabiting the posad of the town on the basis of animal bone remains, as well as at determining the degree of integration of the Russian and native population in the region. The study was carried out using the osteological collection (approximately 12,000 items) obtained during the excavations on the site in 2008-2018. Having compared the materials belonging to different construction layers, we identified three chronological periods covering the time from the mid-17th (the moment this site was built) up to late 18th centuries. When describing bone remains, species composition, skeleton element, as well as the degree of fragmentation, were determined. The age structure of domestic animals was described. During the period under review, as the urban economy was developing, foraging activities decreased in the town of Berezov, whereas production increased. Cattle and reindeer played a dominant role in the diet of the posad population. Starting from the end of the 17th century and later in the 18th century, the raising of predominantly beef cattle was gradually giving place to the raising of dairy cattle. Simultaneously, the region was witnessing a rapid development of large-scale reindeer herding, with the involvement of the Russian population of northern towns in this process. Thus, the lack of domestic meat was compensated for by domestic reindeer meat. The population of the posad kept a small number of pigs, sheep, horses and hens. Dogs were used for hunting and transportation. Game hunting (especially wild geese, ducks and capercaillies), as well as fishing, played an important role in the economy of the population. The population fished mostly large species of fish (sturgeon, pike, nelma) and hunted for elks, hares, as well as fur-bearing animals. The analysis of archaeozoological materials, as well as archaeological data, revealed that mixed Russian and original population resided in the posad of Berezov in the 17th-18th centuries. The economy of the population was typical for Russian towns, exhibiting local natural characteristics and involving the use of all available commercial resources, as well as active cooperation with the original population of the region. –ò–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–æ 11 869 –µ–¥. –∫–æ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –º–ª–µ–∫–æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—é—â–∏—Ö, –ø—Ç–∏—Ü –∏ —Ä—ã–± –∏–∑ —Ä–∞—Å–∫–æ–ø–æ–∫ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –ë–µ—Ä–µ–∑–æ–≤–∞ (–•–∞–Ω—Ç—ã-–ú–∞–Ω—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–º–Ω—ã–π –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥). –ù–∞–∏–±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–ª—è –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –∏–º–µ–ª–∏ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω—ã–π —Ä–æ–≥–∞—Ç—ã–π —Å–∫–æ—Ç –∏ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –æ–ª–µ–Ω—å. –í –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–º –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–æ–¥–∏–ª–∏ —Å–≤–∏–Ω–µ–π, –ª–æ—à–∞–¥–µ–π –∏ –∫—É—Ä. –í —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö —Ü–µ–ª—è—Ö –∏ –Ω–∞ –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ —Å–æ–±–∞–∫. –í–∞–∂–Ω—É—é —Ä–æ–ª—å –≤ —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª–∏ –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ç–∏—Ü, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ —Ä—ã–±–æ–ª–æ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –º–µ–Ω—å—à—É—é - –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∑–≤–µ—Ä–µ–π. –°–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥ –æ –ø—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≤ –ø–æ—Å–∞–¥–µ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ –ë–µ—Ä–µ–∑–æ–≤–∞ –∫–∞–∫ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –∞–±–æ—Ä–∏–≥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. | ['bachura', 'gimranov', 'lobanova', 'martynovich', 'vizgalov'] | ","['bachura', 'gimranov', 'lobanova', 'martynovich', 'vizgalov']",1
143,"Economic utility of the ringed seal (Phoca hispida): Implications for arctic archaeology | This paper presents a ringed seal meat utility index which has implications for analysing archaeofauna from the Arctic. Ethnographical sources indicate that ringed seals are usually transported whole from kill sites to residential sites, indicating that intra- and inter-household activities such as food sharing mechanisms may play a more significant role in conditioning butchering variability and assemblage composition than transport from hunting locations. Qualitative variables such as food preference are also partly responsible for the selection of parts for consumption and subsequent discard. Comparison of a preliminary ranked scale of the ""taste"" preference of ringed seal meat to the meat utility index yields ambiguous results. However, in this study preference is provisionally correlated with phocid seal bone mineral density. The meat weight index, preference ranks, and bone density data are then applied to archaeofauna from the eastern Canadian arctic and Greenland. Results support previous research demonstrating that the absence of taphonomic information such as weathering and carnivore destruction restricts the interpretive strength of utility data. The results also suggest that ethnoarchaeology can contribute further information on butchering, distribution and consumption that can be used in conjunction with, and to help create, models for carcass utility. | ['diab'] | ",['diab'],1

145,"An efficient and reliable DNA-based sex identification method for archaeological Pacific salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) remains | Pacific salmonid (Oncorhynchus spp.) remains are routinely recovered from archaeological sites in northwestern North America but typically lack sexually dimorphic features, precluding the sex identification of these remains through morphological approaches. Consequently, little is known about the deep history of the sex-selective salmonid fishing strategies practiced by some of the region's Indigenous peoples. Here, we present a DNA-based method for the sex identification of archaeological Pacific salmonid remains that integrates two PCR assays that each co-amplify fragments of the sexually dimorphic on the Y chromosome (sdY) gene and an internal positive control (Clockla or D-loop). The first assay co-amplifies a 95 bp fragment of sdY and a 108 bp fragment of the autosomal Clockla gene, whereas the second assay co-amplifies the same sdY fragment and a 249 bp fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop region. This method's reliability, sensitivity, and efficiency, were evaluated by applying it to 72 modern Pacific salmonids from five species and 75 archaeological remains from six Pacific salmonids. The sex identities assigned to each of the modern samples were concordant with their known phenotypic sex, highlighting the method's reliability. Applications of the method to dilutions of modern DNA samples indicate it can correctly identify the sex of samples with as little as [approximately]39 pg of total genomic DNA. The successful sex identification of 70 of the 75 (93%) archaeological samples further demonstrates the method's sensitivity. The method's reliance on two co-amplifications that preferentially amplify sdY helps validate the sex identities assigned to samples and reduce erroneous identifications caused by allelic dropout and contamination. Furthermore, by sequencing the D-loop fragment used as a positive control, species-level and sex identifications can be simultaneously assigned to samples. Overall, our results indicate the DNA-based method reported in this study is a sensitive and reliable sex identification method for ancient salmonid remains. | ['butler', 'cannon', 'devlin', 'royle', 'sakhrani', 'speller', 'yang'] | ","['butler', 'cannon', 'devlin', 'royle', 'sakhrani', 'speller', 'yang']",1

147,"The Empty Quarter? Identifying the Mesolithic of Interior Finnmark, North Norway | Archaeological research in northern Finland has identified a Mesolithic inland occupation extending back to 8500-8000 cal. B.C. Until recently adjacent areas of interior north Norway only revealed evidence for a late Mesolithic occupation post-dating 6000 cal. B.C. This discrepancy can be attributed to lack of research, typologically ambiguous assemblages, lack of radiocarbon dating, and neglect of paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Reassessment of previously collected materials, new AMS dates, and recent fieldwork indicate a Mesolithic occupation of interior Finnmark County by at least 7300 cal. B.C. and considerable late Mesolithic activity 5500-5000 cal. B.C. Current interpretations positing coast-inland cultural dichotomies are problematic given the sparse data from inner Finnmark, a limited understanding of functional variation, and the possible presence of three Mesolithic techno-cultural traditions. | ['hood'] | ",['hood'],1

150,"New environmental metabarcodes for analysing soil DNA: potential for studying past and present ecosystems. (Special Issue: Environmental DNA.) | Metabarcoding approaches use total and typically degraded DNA from environmental samples to analyse biotic assemblages and can potentially be carried out for any kinds of organisms in an ecosystem. These analyses rely on specific markers, here called metabarcodes, which should be optimized for taxonomic resolution, minimal bias in amplification of the target organism group and short sequence length. Using bioinformatic tools, we developed metabarcodes for several groups of organisms: fungi, bryophytes, enchytraeids, beetles and birds. The ability of these metabarcodes to amplify the target groups was systematically evaluated by (i) in silico PCRs using all standard sequences in the EMBL public database as templates, (ii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from surface soil samples from a site in Varanger, northern Norway and (iii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from permanently frozen sediment samples of late-Pleistocene age (~16000-50000 years BP) from two Siberian sites, Duvanny Yar and Main River. Comparison of the results from the in silico PCR with those obtained in vitro showed that the in silico approach offered a reliable estimate of the suitability of a marker. All target groups were detected in the environmental DNA, but we found large variation in the level of detection among the groups and between modern and ancient samples. Success rates for the Pleistocene samples were highest for fungal DNA, whereas bryophyte, beetle and bird sequences could also be retrieved, but to a much lesser degree. The metabarcoding approach has considerable potential for biodiversity screening of modern samples and also as a palaeoecological tool. | ['bellemain', 'boessenkool', 'brathen', 'brochmann', 'coissac', 'edward', 'epp', 'erseus', 'esposito', 'gusarov', 'haile', 'hassel', 'johnsen', 'kauserud', 'riaz', 'stenoien', 'taberlet', 'willerslev', 'yoccoz'] | ","['bellemain', 'boessenkool', 'brathen', 'brochmann', 'coissac', 'edward', 'epp', 'erseus', 'esposito', 'gusarov', 'haile', 'hassel', 'johnsen', 'kauserud', 'riaz', 'stenoien', 'taberlet', 'willerslev', 'yoccoz']",4

The article examines research initiatives focused on reindeer husbandry within the natural sciences during the first half of the 20th century, discussing the motives for these studies as well as why they did not lead to the establishment of a scientific field. It then turns to the development after World War II, analyzing why reindeer husbandry research was established so quickly, and how the field developed up until 1970, both nationally within Sweden and as a Nordic cooperation. | ['lantto'] | ",['lantto'],4
152,"Ethno Archaeological Perspectives on an Athapaskan Moose Alces-Alces-Andersoni Kill | A recent development in anthropology involves examination of living human populations to better understand the formation processes that create archaeological remains. An ethnologist and an archaeologist collaborated in the observation and analysis of procurement, butchering and distribution of moose among a group of contemporary Athapaskan (Chipewyan) Indians in northwestern Saskatchewan [Canada] in 1977. Subtleties in the behavior of one particular hunting party illustrate the complexity and variability of skeletal and anatomic spatial distributions accompany various stages in processing, distributing and consuming a moose (A. alces andersoni). Variables such as seasonality, proximity for a major settlement, transportation technology, sexual division of labor and ideational factors heavily influence the formation of archaeo-faunal remains within several components of a regional settlement system. | ['brumbach', 'jarvenpa'] | ","['brumbach', 'jarvenpa']",4
153,"Ethnohistoric documents as analogical tools: A case study from northwest Alaska | Archaeologists endeavour to reconstruct technological, environmental, social, cultural, and even ideological aspects of past groups and individuals using the fragmented material past. Many, if not all, of these analyses rely on analogy. Archaeologists have used the direct historical approach extensively in the Arctic to develop more nuanced understandings of the prehistoric Inuit. In many cases, the direct historical approach is not truly direct; archaeologists often assume that secondary activities, such as those that occur contemporaneously with initial deposition but that are not described in the ethnographic record such as cleaning and post-depositional processes such as weathering, alter the archaeological patterns and inhibit direct comparison to ethnohistoric sources. In this study, I analyse the relationship between the archaeological record and documentary sources to establish which patterns and activities are visible in the archaeofaunal record. I test expectations based on the documentary record, ethnoarchaeological studies, and taphonomic processes against the faunal assemblage from an early Thule Inuit semi-subterranean dwelling at Cape Espenberg, Alaska. Despite expected disturbances from contemporary activities and post-depositional processes, the faunal assemblage closely resembles expectations of primary household activities described in ethnohistoric accounts relating to consumption, preparation, and storage of subsistence resources. Only a few expectations based on secondary activities are supported. Further work is needed to test these results throughout the Arctic and across time. However, these results suggest that archaeologists can use the direct historical approach, and related ethnographic analogies, directly to interpret archaeofaunal patterning in Thule semi-subterranean houses and middens. | ['norman'] | ",['norman'],1
154,"Evaluating Contemporaneity and Post-Mortem Age of Malacological Remains Using Sclerochronology and Dendrochronology* | Sclerochronology and dendrochronology are based on series of incremental skeletal and cambial growths that have been correctly aligned in time via cross-dating (i.e., incremental dating through synchronization of the growth variability on a visual and statistical basis). Here we report a study of the shell increments of two anthropogenic death assemblages of freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) originating from Finnish Lapland. First, we cross-dated a new sclerochronology from an assemblage of river pearl mussel shells with unknown post-mortem age. Second, this chronology was cross-dated with the previously published sclerochronology of the same species and geographical source. Third, the composite of the two sclerochronologies was compared to dendrochronologies from Lapland. Temporal association of the two types of chronologies was markedly high, as confirmed by t-values of 7.1 and 8.9, which are well above the acceptable limit of 3.5. Our study demonstrates the potential of sclerochronological and dendrochronological materials and techniques in assessing the contemporaneity (i.e., temporal overlap) and post-mortem age of archaeomalacological deposits. In the palaeontological context, these results also show the wider possibility of dating shells with a large number of annual increments from natural deposits. | ['helama', 'nielsen', 'valovirta'] | ","['helama', 'nielsen', 'valovirta']",4
155,"Evidence for geographic variation in the diets of late Pleistocene and early Holocene Bison in North America, and differences from the diets of recent Bison | During the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, Bison was widely dispersed across North America and occupied most regions not covered by ice sheets. A dietary study on Bison paleopopulations from Alaska, New Mexico, Florida, and Texas was performed using two methods that relate dental wear patterns to diet, mesowear analysis and microwear analysis. These data were compared to a mixed sample of extant Bison from the North American central plains, extant wood Bison from Alberta (Canada) and a variety of other modem ungulates. Mesowear relates macroscopic molar facet shape to levels of dietary abrasion. The mesowear signature observed on fossil Bison differs significantly from the hyper-abrasive grazing diet of extant Bison. Tooth microwear examines wear on the surface of enamel at a microscopic scale. The microwear signal of fossil samples resembles to modem Bison, but the fossil samples show a greater diversity of features, suggesting that fossil Bison populations regularly consumed food items that are texturally inconsistent with the short-grass diet typical of modern plains Bison. Mesowear and microwear signals of fossil Bison samples most closely resemble a variety of typical mixed feeding ungulates, all with diets that are substantially less abrasive than what is typical for modem plains Bison. Furthermore, statistical tests suggest significant differences between the microwear signatures of the fossil samples, thus revealing geographic variability in Pleistocene Bison diets. This study reveals that fossils are of value in developing an understanding of the dietary breadth and ecological versatility of species that, in recent times, are rare, endangered, and occupy only a small remnant of their former ranges.

156,"Evidence for Mesolithic agriculture in and around Central Europe? | A critical assessment of the data recently put forward in favour of a 'Mesolithic agriculture' for Central and Northern Europe is presented. The archaeobotanical record is quite clear: hundreds of excavations of early Neolithic sites, whether from Linearbandkeramik or Trichterbecher (funnel beaker) settlements have produced remains of cultivated plants in large numbers. In contrast to this, all Mesolithic sites excavated so far have not revealed even one macroscopic find of crop plants. The 'Mesolithic agriculture' as assumed by several authors, is based solely on single pre-Neolithic pollen grains of the Cerealia-type that occur in pollen diagrams. It is shown that absolute distinction of pollen from wild grasses and cereals is impossible. There is a certain overlapping of both types that must not be neglected. Because of the large pollen sums in modern pollen diagrams, even very scarce grains of Cerealia-type pollen are encountered. Most of these single pre-Neolithic grains must derive from native wild grasses, while others come by long-distance transport etc. Another important feature is the scattered occurrence of Cerealia-type pollen grains from the early Holocene (or even Pleistocene) to the start of the Neolithic. They do not occur in synchronous phases and even in neighbouring sites they do not agree in age. As long as there are no well-dated macro-remains of crop plants of pre-Neolithic age, there is no evidence of Mesolithic agriculture. | ['behre'] | ",['behre'],4
157,"Evidence for the Recent Existence of Mammoths and Mastodons: Implications for Creation and Evolution | Most evolutionists believe the wooly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) was extirpated from mainland Eurasia and North America approximately 10,000 years ago, with the last individuals surviving on Wrangel Island until 3,700 years ago. Similarly, the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) is believed to have gone extinct circa 10,000 years ago. This paper examines the hard data conflicting with these interpretations, including an Egyptian painting of a dwarf mammoth, surviving mastodon intestinal bacteria, sedimentary ancient DNA, and datable artifacts portraying proboscideans. This evidence suggests that mammoths and mastodons survived much later than evolutionists believe, perhaps as late as 800 years ago. It is concluded that the evolutionists' estimates for the extinction dates of mammoths and mastodons are in error, which not only affects their timescale but also creates problems for their hypotheses on the causes of the end-Pleistocene extinction event. | ['marie'] | ",['marie'],1
158,"Evolution of Mammalian Diversity in the Late Pleistocene-Middle Holocene of the Mountainous Regions of Northern Eurasia: Between Two Interglacials | For the first time, reconstruction was carried out and a comparative analysis of the evolution of the parameters of biological diversity (species richness, entropy, dominance index, measure of organization, etc.) of mammalian complexes of six mountain regions of Eurasia in the Late Pleistocene-Holocene was performed. It was shown that their reactions to the MIS 5e and MIS 1 interglacial conditions were fundamentally different, which does not allow us to make direct extrapolations in predicting the reaction of modern fauna to future climate changes. Mountain fauna in MIS 3 and the first half of MIS 2 combined high biological diversity with high resistance. Maintenance of the relative homeostasis of species richness was probably facilitated by the high functional redundancy of the communities, combined with the high ecological diversity of mountain biotopes. | ['markova', 'puzachenko'] | ","['markova', 'puzachenko']",1
159,"Evolution of Subsistence in the Kachemak Tradition - Evaluating the North Pacific Maritime Stability Model | Archaeologists working in the greater Pacific Eskimo/Aleut region of the North Pacific have tended to view culture change occurring in that region against a backdrop of static environments and stable resource exploitation patterns. More recent work in the region, however, has suggested that long-term environmental change did occur, and that exploitation strategies increasingly focused on specialization on higher-yield prey, particularly large sea mammals such as sea lions or porpoises. in a number of areas, ranging from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet, there is increasing evidence that, because of the combined effect of technological efficiency and population growth, coastal populations were impacting the resource base on which they depended. In some areas, such as the Aleutians or Kodiak Island, resource diversity was sufficient to buffer the populations, and intensification occurred in the harvesting of storable resources such as salmon. In the Cook Inlet region, where such resource buffers may have been less effective , overexploitation of large sea mammal resources may have contributed to the demise of the Kachemak Eskimo tradition. | ['yesner'] | ",['yesner'],4
160,"Evolution of the vegetation cover of Peter the Great Bay western coast in the Late Pleistocene-Holocene | The biostratigraphic division of the bottom sediments of the Karasie and Utinoe Lakes by using palynological analysis and radiocarbon dating was made. It allowed us to understand in detail the evolution of the vegetation cover of Peter the Great Bay western coast in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. New evidences of repeated and significant environmental changes over the past 35000 years, corresponding to marine isotope stages (MIS) 3-1, have been established. Recent materials are the basis for paleogeographic reconstructions and correlation of the events within the Quaternary period of the extreme south of the Russian Far East with other Eurasian regions. The results of research showed that the evolution of the vegetation cover in MIS 3 (Q<sub>III</sub><sup>3</sup>) occurred under interglacial conditions. The palinoflora characterizes a short-term warming. The last cold epoch of the Late Pleistocene in MIS 2 (Q<sub>III</sub><sup>4</sup>) was marked by extensive development of vegetation, typical of the North Boreal zone A rapid expansion of deciduous forests happened at the Late Pleistocene and Holocene (Q<sub>III</sub><sup>4</sup>-Q<sub>IV</sub><sup>2</sup>) boundary. Late Glacial vegetation formations completely disappeared by that time. In the range from seven to five thousand years ago polydominant forests of oak, hornbeam and walnut were widespread. The final optimal Holocene (Q<sub>IV</sub><sup>2</sup>-Q<sub>IV</sub><sup>3</sup>) phase was marked by the series of climatic changes. The shrub communities of alder and birch appear again in the composition of the vegetation. In the Late Holocene there is an increase in the structure of plant formations of broadleaf plants and pines. The end of the Late Holocene was marked by a wide development of pine forests. –ü—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –±–∏–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —Ä–∞—Å—á–ª–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π –æ–∑–µ—Ä –ö–∞—Ä–∞—Å—å–µ –∏ –£—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–µ –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∞–º–∏ –ø–∞–ª–∏–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –∏ —Ä–∞–¥–∏–æ—É–≥–ª–µ—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è, –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏–ª–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–± —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–±–µ—Ä–µ–∂—å—è –∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–∞ –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–∞ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–º –ø–ª–µ–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–µ –∏ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–µ. –ë—ã–ª–∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –Ω–æ–≤—ã–µ —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–µ–æ–¥–Ω–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ä–µ–¥—ã –∑–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–µ 35000 –ª., —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–µ –º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–º –∏–∑–æ—Ç–æ–ø–Ω—ã–º —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏—è–º (–ú–ò–°) 3-1. –ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π –¥–ª—è –ø–∞–ª–µ–æ–≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ä–µ–∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏–π –∏ –∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–ª—è—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏–π –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ –∫–≤–∞—Ä—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –∫—Ä–∞–π–Ω–µ–≥–æ —é–≥–∞ –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≥–æ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Å –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º–∏ —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–∞–º–∏ –ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–∏. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –≤ –ú–ò–° 3 (Q<sub>III</sub><sup>3</sup>) –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞ –≤ –º–µ–∂–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö. –ü–∞–ª–∏–Ω–æ—Ñ–ª–æ—Ä–∞ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑—É–µ—Ç –∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ. –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω—è—è —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∞ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ –ø–ª–µ–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –≤ –ú–ò–° 2 (Q<sub>III</sub><sup>4</sup>) –æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞—Å—å —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–∏–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ–º —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –¥–ª—è —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–±–æ—Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∑–æ–Ω—ã. –ù–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ –ø–ª–µ–π—Å—Ç–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –∏ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–∞ –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—è —ç–∫—Å–ø–∞–Ω—Å–∏—è —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤. –ü–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∏—Å—á–µ–∑–ª–∏ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤—ã–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏. –í –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤–∞–ª–µ 7000-5000 —Ç—ã—Å. –ª.–Ω. –æ—Ç–º–µ—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–ª–∏–¥–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤ –∏–∑ –¥—É–±–∞, –≥—Ä–∞–±–∞ –∏ –æ—Ä–µ—Ö–∞. –ó–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–ø—Ç–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Ñ–∞–∑—ã –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ (Q<sub>IV</sub><sup>2</sup>-Q<sub>IV</sub><sup>3</sup>) —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å —Å–µ—Ä–∏—è–º–∏ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π. –í —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤–Ω–æ–≤—å —Ñ–∏–∫—Å–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –∏–∑ –±–µ—Ä–µ–∑—ã –∏ –æ–ª—å—Ö–∏. –í –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–º –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–π —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏ —Å–æ—Å–µ–Ω. –ö–æ–Ω–µ—Ü –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–ª—Å—è —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–∏–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ–º —Å–æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤.

161,"Evolutionary history and palaeoecology of brown bear in North-East Siberia re-examined using ancient DNA and stable isotopes from skeletal remains | Over 60% of the modern distribution range of brown bears falls within Russia, yet palaeoecological data from the region remain scarce. Complete modern Russian brown bear mitogenomes are abundant in the published literature, yet examples of their ancient counterparts are absent. Similarly, there is only limited stable isotopic data of prehistoric brown bears from the region. We used ancient DNA and stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes retrieved from five PleistoceneYakutian brown bears (one Middle Pleistocene and four Late Pleistocene), to elucidate the evolutionary history and palaeoecology of the species in the region. We were able to reconstruct the complete mitogenome of one of the Late Pleistocene specimens, but we were unable to assign it to any of the previously published brown bear mitogenome clades. A subsequent analysis of published mtDNA control region sequences, which included sequences of extinct clades from other geographic regions, assigned the ancientYakutian bear to the extinct Glade 3c; a Glade previously identified from Late Quaternary specimens from Eastern Beringia and Northern Spain. Our analyses of stable isotopes showed relatively high delta N-15 values in the PleistoceneYakutian brown bears, suggesting a more carnivorous diet than contemporary brown bears from Eastern Beringia. | ['baryshnikov', 'bocherens', 'boeskorov', 'garcia', 'vazquez', 'lorenzen', 'rey', 'iglesia', 'szpak', 'treadaway', 'van', 'der', 'plicht'] | ","['baryshnikov', 'bocherens', 'boeskorov', 'garcia', 'vazquez', 'lorenzen', 'rey', 'iglesia', 'szpak', 'treadaway', 'van', 'der', 'plicht']",4

Sapozhnikov in the Ob Bay (1919) | The organization and research activities of Kotelnikov's Northern expedition to the gulf of Ob-Taz as well as those of the expedition of the Siberian Research Institute headed by Professor V. Sapozhnikov are reconstructed in the article on the basis of archive materials, documentary publications and periodicals. The Government of Kolchak was known to be activity seeking supply channels through which foreign powers might render them military and economic aid. To this end, the Committee of the Northern Sea Route was established in April 1919. The maim purpose of the committee was organization and regulation of export of Siberian raw materials and manufactured goods, import of foreign goods by the Northern Sea Route as well as looking out measures of improving the route. The Siberian Research Institute established in Tomsk in 1919 was also interested in the study of the region. The researchers of the Institute were granted an opportunity of organizing an expedition to the northern regions to do the botanical, geographical and magnetic survey of the region adjacent to the Ob Bay. During the Northern Expedition D. Kotelnikov managed to make land marking and erect navigation signs on both banks of the gulf of Ob-Taz from the bar of the Ob River to White Island as well as collect materials for sailing directions and sailing management in these regions. One of the aims of the expedition was to meet ships from Arkhangelsk delivering valuable ""military cargo"" such as officers, engineers, mechanics, agriculturists the Government of Kolchak was in need of. V. Sapozhnikov's expeditions succeeded in carrying out the study of meadow species composition in the lower reaches of the Ob and Irtysh region; exploring tundra vegetation as far as latitude N 70¬∞; obtaining information concerning husbandry and agriculture development on the territory from Samarovo to Obdorsk; gathering a rich botanical collection, zoological and tundra soil samples. Besides they clarified the topographical data of the Taz Bay and made recommendations regarding the possibility of building a port in the Nakhodka Bay. One of the researchers of the Institute, S. Shubin, did magnetic research. It is emphasized that D. Kotelnikov's and V. Sapozhnikov's expeditions to the Ob Bay during the Civil War made a notable contribution to the study of Northern Siberia.

NgVh-1 is a habitation site located west of the Trail River, about 25 km south of the Beaufort Sea. The presence of foetal and neonate caribou and of medullary bone in some ptarmigan remains indicates that the site was occupied from late May until late June. Activities related to bone-processing, tool manufacture, and skin-working were shown to have been carried out at the site. Analysis of the faunal material has demonstrated that 21 species were present, of which caribou and ptarmigan were the most important. The site also has abundant debris associated with objects made from antler and, to a lesser degree, with those made from bone. -English summary | ['nagy'] | ",['nagy'],4
164,"Exploratory Models of Intersite Variability in Mid to Late Holocene Central Alaska | Interrelated aspects of technology, site structure, and subsistence patterns in central Alaska are synthesized using a comprehensive database of radiocarbon-dated components. Microblade technology is examined with respect to broad patterns of technology, settlement, and subsistence. Striking changes in the archaeological record during the Late Holocene (similar to 1000 cal BP), including the loss of microblades, are explored through three general models: technological and economic change within existing populations, population replacement or assimilation, and taphonomic bias. The evidence most strongly supports the first: a shift from multiseasonal large mammal hunting strategies with associated high residential mobility to exploitation of seasonally overabundant resources (caribou, fish) and increased logistical mobility and reliance on storage. | ['potter'] | ",['potter'],1
165,"Exploring meat processing in the past: Insights from the Nunamiut people | Improving our knowledge of subsistence strategies and food processing techniques of past societies is of prime interest for better understanding human cultures as well as multiple aspects of human evolution. Beyond the simple matter of food itself, a substantial portion of socio-economic behavior is expressed in what, how, when, and with whom we eat. Over the last few decades, diverse methodologies for the analysis and interpretation of cut marks have progressively provided new insights for past butchery practices. For example, a recent study of the production of antelope biltong in South Africa concluded that the drying of meat generates high frequencies of longitudinal cut marks. This paper presents a cut mark analysis of faunal remains recovered by Lewis Binford from 8 campsites occupied by Nunamiut groups from the end of 19(th) to middle of the 20(th) century in the area around Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska. The preparation of meat-primarily from caribou (Rangifer tarandus)-varied at these sites according to the season of occupation and was, depending on the site, either immediately consumed, processed after being stored in ice-cellars, or dried and stored. These faunal assemblages therefore provide a unique opportunity to explore the material traces of different meat preparation and preservation techniques in order to identify whether specific patterns can be identified and subsequently used to explore subsistence practices in the past. Binford's Nunamiut faunal assemblages, which were produced by individuals using traditional techniques and methods, were analyzed in order to 1) further test the hypothesis that meat drying produces high frequencies of longitudinal cut marks, 2) explore the common assumption that skilled butchers leave smaller numbers of cut marks on bones compared to less experienced individuals, and 3) test whether cut mark patterns vary as a function of the processing techniques employed. The introduction of a %cutL index represents a quicker alternative to geo-referencing cut marks on bones when exploring meat processing techniques and methods and can easily be integrated in zooarchaeological analyses. While the results obtained support processing techniques linked to meat drying to leave high numbers of longitudinal cut marks, they are inconsistent with cut mark frequencies varying as a function of the butcher's skill and experience. Analyzing cut mark patterns is therefore a reliable means for exploring food processing by past human societies and, by extension, their methods for safeguarding against unfavorable seasonal variations in both the abundance and condition of prey species. Identifying food storage in the archaeological record equally provides a unique window on to the social dynamics and potential inequalities of past societies. | ['soulier'] | ",['soulier'],1
166,"Exploring unknown life stages of Arctic Tanytarsini (Diptera: Chironomidae) with DNA barcoding | We present the first results from a project on Spitsbergen and Bear Island where the ultimate goal is to provide genetic and morphological identification keys to all species. Five Tanytarsini species have been recorded from Svalbard. By sequencing partial COI gene sequences, we have associated larvae of all of these, and describe the hitherto undescribed larval stages of Microspectra insignilobus Kieffer, M. radialis Goetghebuer and Tanytarsus heliomesonyctios Langton. We also present keys to larva, pupa and imagines of all Tanytarsini species found on Svalbard and discuss larval morphology in relationship to characters preserved in subfossil material. Of particular interest is the mandible and mentum of T. heliomsonyctios which show close resemblance to the tentatively associated larvae of Corynocera oliveri Lindeberg. An overview over Tanytarsus species with ""lugens-type"" larvae is given and the phylogenetic value of mandibular accessory teeth is briefly discussed. | ['ekrem', 'stur'] | ","['ekrem', 'stur']",0
167,"The extinction of woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) and straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus) in Europe | Together with several other megafaunal species in Northern Eurasia, Mammuthus primigenius and Palaeoloxodon antiquus became extinct in the Last Glacial-Interglacial cycle, but they had very different ecologies, times of extinction and `last stands' in different regions. The dramatic contraction in mammoth range ca. 12 kyr (uncalibrated C-14 chronology), after which known populations were confined to Northern Siberia (mainly Taymyr and Wrangel Island), correlates well with the extensive spread of trees in the Allerod phase of the Late Glacial Interstadial. The return of open steppe-tundra in the Younger Dryas cold phase, ca. 10.6-10 kyr, saw a limited re-expansion into NE Europe, followed by retraction and apparent extinction of mainland populations, which can be correlated with the marked loss of open habitats in the early Holocene. In contrast, at the end of the Last Interglacial, the retreat of P. antiquus to S. Europe, where it may have survived to ca. 50-34 kyr, can be linked to the loss of woodland habitats elsewhere. Although in both species, climate acting through vegetational changes evidently drove these range shifts, environmental change alone appears insufficient to account for extinctions. However, the possible role of human hunters is also still unclear. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved. | ['stuart'] | ",['stuart'],1
168,"Faunal exploitation, subsistence practices and Pleistocene extinctions in Paleolithic Siberia | The vast territory of Northern Asia attracted the attention of the students of prehistory for a long time. This area is of crucial importance for the study of Pleistocene extinctions. The paper summarises the available data from 29 Middle and 321 Upper Paleolithic faunal assemblages (only large mammals are included in the analysis) arranged in chronological and geographical order. Subsistence activities of the Middle Paleolithic were based on hunting of ungulates, mostly horse, wild goat, bison, deer, wild ass. It should be added that Okladnikov Cave witnessed also a prominent role of bird hunting and fishing. Meanwhile it is unlikely that specialised hunting took place and we need additional information to reconstruct subsistence behaviour. The Upper Paleolithic inhabitants of Siberia relied heavily on bison, reindeer and horse hunting, while the role of mammoth and woolly rhinoceros (except the Eastern Trans-Baikal) decreased. Different adaptations to periglacial steppe, forest-steppe, forest and mountain environments could be discerned. The end of the Pleistocene witnessed changes in subsistence behaviour as evidenced by an increasing role of fishing and gathering. | ['vasilev'] | ",['vasilev'],4

170,"Models of faunal processing and economy in Early Holocene interior Alaska | This study represents the first detailed published analysis of a relatively large archaeologically derived faunal assemblage in eastern Beringia for the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene. The faunal remains, dated to 10,100 cal. BP, are well preserved and have highly resolved spatial association with lithics and hearth features. Factors in the formation of the assemblage are assessed through analyses of weathering, presence/absence of carnivore damage, fragmentation patterns, bone density, and economic utility. Taphonomic analyses indicate that human transport and processing decisions were the major agents responsible for assemblage formation. A spatial model of wapiti and bison carcass processing at this site is proposed detailing faunal trajectories from the kill sites, introduction on site in a central staging area to peripheral marrow extraction areas associated with hearths and lithic items. Data from mortality profiles, spatial analysis, and economic analysis are used to interpret general economy and site function within this period in Interior Alaska. These data and intersite comparisons demonstrate that considerable economic variability existed during the Early Holocene, from broad spectrum foraging to efficient, specialized terrestrial large mammal hunting. | ['potter'] | ",['potter'],4
171,"An Analysis of Faunal Remains From A Denbigh Flint Complex Camp at Matcharak Lake, Alaska | The Matcharak Lake site, located in the Brooks Range, Alaska, represents the first faunal assemblage recovered from a Denbigh Flint Complex (early Arctic Small Tool tradition) locality anywhere in Arctic Alaska. Organic remains, which include numerous bone tools, are well preserved in the frozen tundra soil of this 3,900 year-old site. Over 81,000 faunal specimens were unearthed with the identified portion predominantly composed of caribou; however, Dall's sheep, small mammals, bird, and fish were also recovered. Seasonal indicators suggest the hunting and butchering events occurred in the fall and spring. The presence of migratory bird and Alaska marmot suggest people camped here in the summer as well. Empirical evidence for Paleoeskimo subsistence are limited to coastal sites in the eastern Arctic. Matcharak Lake provides the first substantial dataset for supporting subsistence models for inland Denbigh groups in Alaska. Caribou clearly dominate in terms of potential calories and resource materials for clothing and shelter. | ['tremayne'] | ",['tremayne'],0

173,"Fern rhizomes as fodder in Norway | Background: Although ferns are often known under collective names in Norway, e.g. blom, a substantial number of vernacular names for individual fern species are known, in particular for useful or poisonous taxa. In the past, the rhizomes (Norwegian: moldfor) of selected species were collected for fodder. Only scattered records of such use are available from southern Norway, and the tradition's core area is found in the two North Norwegian counties of Nordland and Troms, in accordance with the longer winters encountered in the north, frequently leading to fodder shortage in early spring. The tradition extends northeastwards into Finnmark, but is less well documented there. Although numerous sources mention the use of fern rhizomes for fodder, the fern species hiding behind the tradition are incompletely known. This paper aims at reviewing available data in terms of identifyng the species used for fodder, the history and geographical distribution of such use, and other relevant traditions, e.g. the timing and mode of collection, and the way the rhizomes were used. Methods: The study is based on data extracted from a variety of archival and literature sources; the latter retrived from my database of more than 7500 publications providing information on plant names and plant uses in Norway. Results: More than 200 individual records mention the use of fern rhizomes for fodder in Norway. Only a fraction of these, typically made by botanist recording data on plant uses, provides information on the identity of the species used. Based on these, Dryopteris filix-mas and Matteuccia struthiopteris stand out as the most important species serving as sources of fern rhizomes for fodder. Locally, Dryopteris expansa was the preferred species, and this taxon may to some extent be overlooked in the records so far available. With a few exceptions, Norwegian folk tradition singles out Athyrium filix-femina as a harmful and poisonous species, causing livestock to go blind and lame, but whether this is true or not, remains unknown; the symptoms are in fact documented elsewhere as a consequence of poisoning due to Dryopteris filix-mas. In coastal north Norway, fern rhizomes were regularly collected for fodder, both in late autumn and early spring, and used to remedy a recurrent shortage of fodder in late winter and spring. Locally, the tradition of collecting fern rhizomes lived on until the 1940's or 1950's. Although mainly a tradition of the ethnic Norwegians, it had also been adopted by the farmers belonging to the Finnish and Sami ethnic minorities. Conclusion: Fern rhizomes have a long tradition as an additional fodder for livestock in Norway. Preferred species were Matteuccia struthiopteris and Dryopteris filix-mas, locally also Dryopteris expansa. Athyrium filix-femina was considered to be poisonous, and usually avoided. | ['alm'] | ",['alm'],1

These have been interpreted as either taphonomically mixed or representative of communities that no longer exist. Accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates (n=60) on single bones of stratigraphically associated fossil micromammals from two American and two Russian sites document for the first time that currently allopatric mammals occurred together between 12,000 and 22,000 yr B.P. on two continents. The existence of mammal communities without modern analogs demonstrates that Northern Hemisphere biological communites are ephemeral and that many modern biomes are younger than 12 ka. Future climate change may result in new nonanalog communities. | ['graham', 'klippel', 'markova', 'semken', 'jr', 'smirnov', 'southon', 'stafford', 'jr'] | ","['graham', 'klippel', 'markova', 'semken', 'jr', 'smirnov', 'southon', 'stafford', 'jr']",1

Significant changes in technology can, however, be tracked around 6000 and 1000 cal B.P.(1) These seem to relate to changes in resource scheduling and land use strategies, shifts from residential to logistic mobility, and increased reliance on storage.

177,"First archaeogenetic results verify the mid-Holocene occurrence of Dalmatian pelican Pelecanus crispus far out of present range | The paper presents an evaluation of subfossil bird bones from archaeological and geological sites in Europe that shows that birds of the genus Pelecanus occurred far out of their present range between 7.4 and 5.0 ka BP in the Danish archipelago. Additionally, from other northwestern European regions mid-Holocene records of pelicans are known. However, due to morphological similarities there are difficulties in species identification. In this paper ancient DNA barcoding techniques were used to clarify the species assignment of one of these records for the first time. Our results show that the bone derives from Dalmatian pelican Pelecanus crispus, a species that today breeds in 15 colonies in the eastern Mediterranean. This species identification is especially remarkable since the Dalmatian pelican is known to be less migratory. We demonstrate that the appearance and disappearance of pelicans in northwestern Europe coincide with climate parameters, since all records fall within warm periods. This applies for the larger group of Danish records during the Holocene thermal maximum in northern Europe as well as for two more groups of records from central Europe and Britain dating to 1.9 and 0.8 ka ago. Recent ecological research on the Dalmatian pelican shows that the species seems to profit from the modern climate changes and is starting to expand its range. Our paper documents that under special circumstances short-distance migrant birds are also able to expand their ranges to areas far outside of the former distribution areas. Finally, the Dalmatian pelican is presented as an indicator species reflecting special climate conditions. The present study demonstrates not only the possibility to recover avian DNA from at least 7 ka old bones, but the relevance of such genetic analysis in combination with archaeological data, particularly if bones could not be assigned to species level by morphological features. In such cases, aDNA is shown as a valuable tool for the reconstruction of the avifauna of the past. | ['nikulina', 'schmoelcke'] | ","['nikulina', 'schmoelcke']",1
178,"First contribution of paleoparasitology to the study of coprolites from the Neolithic site Serteya II (NW Russia) | Paleoparasitological analysis was performed on a set of ten coprolites recovered during excavations of the Neolithic site Serteya II (NW Russia). Eggs of four gastrointestinal parasite taxa were identified, namely the fish tapeworm genus Diphyllobothrium, the giant kidney worm Dioctophyma renale, and two trematode taxa, including the liver lancet fluke genus Dicrocoelium. The diversity of parasites enables us to discuss the biological origin of the studied material, which can be attributed to carnivores, probably to canids. This is only the second record of ancient parasites in this part of the world for the Neolithic period and our results are consistent with those from the first study. They contribute to highlighting relationships between humans and animals, and show how environments and human activities can induce parasite transmission. | ['dolbunova', 'le', 'bailly', 'maicher', 'maigrot', 'mazurkevich'] | ","['dolbunova', 'le', 'bailly', 'maicher', 'maigrot', 'mazurkevich']",1
179,"First dendro-archaeological evidence of a completely excavated medieval settlement in the extreme north of Western Siberia | The Buchta Nakhodka settlement is the only archaeological site in the northern part of Western Siberia that has been fully excavated. This well-preserved settlement on Russia's Yamal Peninsula around 67 degrees N and 72 degrees E, however, has not yet been calendar dated, and the cultural identity of its inhabitants still remains unknown. Here we apply, for the first time, dendrochronological techniques to absolutely date 13 of the most important archaeological timbers from the Buchta Nakhodka settlement. Statistical robust cross-dating results place the construction into the second quarter of the 13th century. The Buchta Nakhodka settlement reveals no obvious connection with the modern, nomadic population of Yamal, the Nenets. Together with a careful literature review, this study indicates that the closest construction techniques and subsequent settlement forms can be found on Iceland and across northern Fennoscandia, where Sami people are building their houses in a similar way. Our combined archaeological, dendrochronological, ethnographical and (archaeo) zoological evidence suggests that the ancient inhabitants of Buchta Nakhodka were closely related to the Sihirtya people that were often mentioned in ancient Nenets folklore as legendary people who inhabited the Yamal Peninsula previously. In providing unique insights into the medieval settlement history of the northern part of Western Siberia, we hope to encourage further interdisciplinary research projects to be launched at Eurasia's high-northern latitudes. | ['buntgen', 'kardash', 'myglan', 'omurova', 'sidorova'] | ","['buntgen', 'kardash', 'myglan', 'omurova', 'sidorova']",4
180,"First expedition by L. G. ramensky and its importance in his creative bioGraphy | The paper follows the series of publications in ‚ÄúVegetation of Russia‚Äù devoted to L. G. Ramensky (Golub, 2013, 2014, 2017 a,b). It tells about the first field trip by Ramensky together with V. P. Savich in 1907 on the northwest of the St. Petersburg province, where they under the guidance by V. L. Komarov studied the vegetation of lakes and swamps. Undoubted interest in the biography by Ramensky is represented by his choice of the direction by which he moved into the field of phytocenology. We tried to search for the reasons that pushed him to the chosen path in the impressions and experience that he took out in the first expedition in his life One of the sources of information about this expedition was the Savich's archive at the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, that contains the photo album with the photographs taken in 1907. The second important source of the events of that summer were the letters (now stored in the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences) by Ramensky and Savich, which they sent to Komarov. Entering the St. Petersburg University in 1906, Ramensky began from the very first days to take part in the work of the student scientific botanical society. With a group of students, he made several excursions in St. Petersburg vicinity under the leadership by A. A. Elenkin, collecting mosses and lichens. Then together with Savich, he in the course of the whole year was engaged in their identifying. However, in 1907 they both went to another head, namely to V. L. Komarov, who began to supervise the student botanical society. Thanks to Komarov Ramensky and Savich get a business trip sponsored by the St. Petersburg Society of Naturalists to Gdov and Yamburg regions of the St. Petersburg province where they studied the flora and vegetation of the lakes and swamps The beginning of this expedition was not successful. The first point where they stopped was Ust-Narva in Estlandia, where Ramensky fell ill, that made further participation in field researches very problematic. Fortunately, he quickly recovered. Judging by the Komarov's photo on the cape Kolganpya on the Soykinskiy Peninsula in the Savich's album, he visited his pupils and made excursions along together with them. Ramensky and Savich reported the results of their first expedition at a meeting of the student scientific botanical society, as well as to the Imperial St. Petersburg Society of Naturalists. One of the reports, made by Ramensky on March 19, 1908, was entitled ‚ÄúOn the —Åomparative method of ecological investigation of plant communities‚Äù. The title of this report literally coincides with that which he made two years later at the 12th Congress of Russian Naturalists and Physicians. The idea of continuum in the plant cover was set forth in the published abstract (Ramensky, 1910). The question is legitimate: ‚ÄúWas it really enough the only field season to come to the idea so not ordinary for his time‚Äù? We have to admit that yes. Plant communities of lakes, swamps, especially coastalaquatic phytocenoseses are greatly appropriate for such conclusions. Especially obviously the changes in plant populations are seen when moving from the water edge of the lake up the slope of the shore, where soil moisture gradually decreases. However, this was not the only reason for a new look at the vegetation cover. In 1906-1907 Ramensky closely communicated with Elenkin, who developed the theory of ‚Äúmobile equilibrium‚Äù in the relationship of living organisms among themselves and with their environment. Later this theory became for Ramensky the basis from which he derived the main regularities of plant cover, including its continuum. Acquaintance to Elenkin's publications and, furthermore, conversations with him, could promote formation at Ramensky of view on vegetation, different from that of the geobotanists of that time. We beleive, Ramensky's physico-mathematical training, which he received while studying for two years at the Mining Institute, also contributed to a new view of the plant cover. Thus, it can be assu ed that a set of factors helped the second-year student of St. Petersburg University, with the only field season, to formulated a revolutionary idea that was not immediately accepted by phytocenologists, and in general by biologists. The first expedition determined the objects of Ramensky's research for a long time. Komarov appreciated his and Savich's work and took them in next 1908 to Kamchatka, where Ramensky continued the swamp and lake vegetation studying. In 1909-1911 he studied the water and coastal-aquatic vegetation of the St. Petersburg province and the neighboring Olonets one. Ramensky quickly became so authoritative expert in the field of studying of this vegetation that in 1909 he was involved in development of the all-Russian ‚ÄúProgram for botanical-geographical researches‚Äù, for which he wrote the chapter ‚ÄúWater and coastal vegetation‚Äù. When in 1911 Ramensky was invited to Voronezh province for ‚Äúnatural historical research‚Äù, he began his activity with the study of lake and swamp vegetation, gradually passing to the research of meadows. Later, Ramensky studied various types of vegetation. Nevertheless, the phytocoenoseses of hydromorphic landscapes, which he has faced in his first expedition, were forever the most interesting to him. ¬© 2018 Russian Academy of Sciences, V.L.

The remains of seven species of ostracods and three species of cladocerans were recovered from the bottom sediments of seven ponds in the region. The most abundant Arctocypris fuhrmanni Petkovski, Scharf and Keyser, 2016 was accompanied by the most widespread Candona rectangulata Alm, 1914, Limnocythere liporeticulata Delorme, 1968 and Tonnacypris glacialis (Sars, 1890) which are endemic to Arctic regions. New to the area Tonnacypris cf. mazepovae (Van der Meeren, Khand and Martens, 2009) was also encountered, being the first record of this species outside Northern Mongolia.

Significant differences in crustacean distribution occurred both between and within studied ponds presumably connected with the duration of active vegetation period and/or melt water delivery.

182,"First molecular and isotopic evidence of millet processing in prehistoric pottery vessels | Analysis of organic residues in pottery vessels has been successful in detecting a range of animal and plant products as indicators of food preparation and consumption in the past. However, the identification of plant remains, especially grain crops in pottery, has proved elusive. Extending the spectrum is highly desirable, not only to strengthen our understanding of the dispersal of crops from centres of domestication but also to determine modes of food processing, artefact function and the culinary significance of the crop. Here, we propose a new approach to identify millet in pottery vessels, a crop that spread throughout much of Eurasia during prehistory following its domestication, most likely in northern China. We report the successful identification of miliacin (olean-18-en-3 beta-ol methyl ether), a pentacyclic triterpene methyl ether that is enriched in grains of common/broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), in Bronze Age pottery vessels from the Korean Peninsula and northern Europe. The presence of millet is supported by enriched carbon stable isotope values of bulk charred organic matter sampled from pottery vessel surfaces and extracted n-alkanoic acids, consistent with a C-4 plant origin. These data represent the first identification of millet in archaeological ceramic vessels, providing a means to track the introduction, spread and consumption of this important crop. | ['barcons', 'craig', 'czebreszuk', 'eley', 'gorton', 'heron', 'kirleis', 'kneisel', 'lucquin', 'mueller', 'nishida', 'shoda', 'son'] | ","['barcons', 'craig', 'czebreszuk', 'eley', 'gorton', 'heron', 'kirleis', 'kneisel', 'lucquin', 'mueller', 'nishida', 'shoda', 'son']",1

Results show that prehistoric inhabitants occupied a stone-sorted polygon where retooling, game processing, and raw material procurement occurred mostly between 12,720 and at least 11,340 cal. yr B.P. We argue that once polygon formation ended, the stratigraphic context remained relatively intact. Further studies focused on the site's lithic and bone assemblages will help shape our understanding of the relationship between fluted point technology, microblades, and caribou hunting in northern Alaska. | ['buvit', 'hedman', 'kuehn', 'rasic'] | ","['buvit', 'hedman', 'kuehn', 'rasic']",1
185,"Forest ungulates found in holocene archaeological materials from the European northeast | The ungulate fauna present in Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Eneolithic Age sites of the Pechora and Vychegda Basins were considerable. These sites differed in archaeological culture and in the type of settlement they represented. Established sites included summer and winter camps, permanent settlements, and temporary campsites. In spite of many changes in natural conditions, moose (Alces alces) were utilized consistently throughout the early and middle Holocene. The significance of this trend for the economy was that it affected the ideology of the human population. | ['kosinskaya', 'volokitin'] | ","['kosinskaya', 'volokitin']",1
186,"Formation of a bird community on a new island, Surtsey, Iceland | The present paper summarizes bird observations from Surtsey, Iceland since the formation of the island in 1963 until 2008. Continuous observations were maintained in the early years of the island; in spring and autumn 1967[long dash]1971 and summers 1970[long dash]1973. Since then much of the bird observations are incidental by various scientists and bird watchers visiting the island for a limited period. Different aspects of the bird fauna are examined, the at-sea bird community, vagrants, migrant species, and winter birds, while emphasis is placed on the formation of the breeding bird community. With increasing numbers of breeding species and size of breeding populations as the years passed more structured census of the breeders was needed. Hence whole island censuses were organized in 1990 and 2003. Ringing has been carried out on five occasions. In total 91 bird species have been recorded on or offshore from the island. The first birds started breeding in 1970, Black Guillemot Cepphus grylle and Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis. A total of fourteen species have since bred on the island. Four species of large gulls breed (mostly in one colony); Great Black-backed Gull Larus marinus (bred first in 1974), Herring Gull Larus argentatus (1981), Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus ([approximately]1985), and Glaucous Gull Larus hyperboreus (1993). The colony, starting to form in 1984, has been particularly important for furthering the development of plant and invertebrate communities. Through the fertilizing agency complete vegetation cover is now found in the oldest part of the gull colony. This development has paved the way for terrestrial birds to start breeding; Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis (1996), Greylag Goose Anser anser ([approximately]2001) and Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis ([approximately]2003). Other breeding species are Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (1975) and White Wagtail Motacilla alba ([approximately]2003), but Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea (1975) has not bred since 1978. In 1990 the island had 316 breeding pairs of six species. In 2003 eleven species bred on the island with a total of about 850 breeding pairs. After 2003 two more species have started breeding, Common Puffin Fratercula arctica (2004) and Raven Corvus corax (2008). Surtsey Island was entered on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2008, not the least for the long history of research and monitoring of various aspects of the island's natural history. As the breeding bird fauna develops a structured bird monitoring program becomes the more important. Recommendations on how this should be carried out are presented in the paper. | ['petersen'] | ",['petersen'],4

The diversity of spruce phytocenoses developed on cryometamorphic humus-enriched gley soils brown soils and illuvial-humusiron podzols is shown. The results of the palynological analysis confi rm the fact that spruce has been growing from the middle of the Subatlantic period. They also characterize the main developmental stages of soils and vegetation in the territory studied. The maintenance of the spruce biogeocenosis during the Late Holocene may be related to the microclimatic conditions, properties of the parent rocks, and the location of this area at the lower accumulative part of the range slope. –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–∏ —É–Ω–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –µ–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –ü–æ–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ–º –£—Ä–∞–ª–µ. –ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–µ –µ–ª–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Ñ–∏—Ç–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–æ–∑–æ–≤, —Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞ –≥–ª–µ–µ–∑–µ–º–∞—Ö –∫—Ä–∏–æ–º–µ—Ç–∞–º–æ—Ä—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–æ-–≥—É–º—É—Å–æ–≤—ã—Ö, –±—É—Ä–æ–∑–µ–º–∞—Ö –∏ –ø–æ–¥–∑–æ–ª–∞—Ö –∏–ª–ª—é–≤–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ-–≥—É–º—É—Å–æ–≤–æ-–∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–∏—Å—Ç—ã—Ö. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –ø–∞–ª–∏–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞—é—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –µ–ª–∏, –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞—è —Å —Å–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏–Ω—ã —Å—É–±–∞—Ç–ª–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞, –∏ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∑—É—é—Ç –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ —ç—Ç–∞–ø—ã —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ—á–≤ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ–º–æ–π —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. –°–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –µ–ª–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –±–∏–æ–≥–µ–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–æ–∑–∞ –≤ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ –ü–æ–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ–º –£—Ä–∞–ª–µ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–æ —Å –º–∏–∫—Ä–æ–∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è–º–∏, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ —Å –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º–∏ –ø–æ—á–≤–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—É—é—â–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –∏ –≥–µ–æ–º–æ—Ä—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–∏—É—Ä–æ—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ–º–æ–≥–æ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞ –∫ –Ω–∏–∂–Ω–µ–π –∞–∫–∫—É–º—É–ª—è—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–∞.

188,"Fortified Settlement Chicha 1 - the Aboriginal Population and the Migrants - Traditional Economy and Adaptation to New Conditions | Chicha 1 settlement in the south of the Barabin forest-steppe (Western Siberia) is dated as the X-VIII centuries BC. Two isolated ethno-cultural groups synchronously coexisted in the territory of the hillfort - the autochthonous (the bearers of the Irmen culture) and the migrants from other territories - from the Northern Kazakhstan steppe (Berlik culture), and from the south-taiga and the forest-steppe Irtysh zones (Krasnoozersk culture). Large scale migrations of the population in the south of Western Siberia during this period were caused by the natural and climatic changes, particularly by the sharp cooling. A symbiosis of different culture bearers within the boundaries of one settlement might be explained with the differences in their economies. The fauna remains analysis demonstrated that the basis of economy of the population of peripheral parts of the settlement (the Berlik and the Krasnoozersk cultures) was the cow husbandry and, to a lesser extent, horse breeding, while hunting was not of a particular importance for this group. At the same time a significant contribution to the economy of the inhabitants of the lakeside part of the settlement (the Irmen culture) alongside with the breeding of horses, black cattle, sheep and goats, and hunting and sledge dogs was made by hunting for elk, wild horse, fur animals, waterfowl and fishing. –ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â–µ –ß–∏—á–∞-1 –Ω–∞ —é–≥–µ –ë–∞—Ä–∞–±–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ª–µ—Å–æ—Å—Ç–µ–ø–∏ (–ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–∞—è –°–∏–±–∏—Ä—å) –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è X-VIII –≤–≤. –¥–æ –Ω.—ç. –ù–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â–∞ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–æ—Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –¥–≤–µ –æ–±–æ—Å–æ–±–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —ç—Ç–Ω–æ–∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è - –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ö—Ç–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ (–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –∏—Ä–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã) –∏ –ø—Ä–∏—à–ª—ã—Ö –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ - –∏–∑ —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–π –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞ (–±–µ—Ä–ª–∏–∫—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞) –∏ –∏–∑ —é–∂–Ω–æ-—Ç–∞–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π –∏ –ª–µ—Å–æ—Å—Ç–µ–ø–Ω–æ–π –∑–æ–Ω –ü—Ä–∏–∏—Ä—Ç—ã—à—å—è (–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–æ–∑–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞). –ú–∞—Å—à—Ç–∞–±–Ω—ã–µ –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ —é–≥–µ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏ –≤ —ç—Ç–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ–±—É—Å–ª–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ-–∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏, –≤ —á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ä–µ–∑–∫–∏–º –ø–æ—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞. –°–∏–º–±–∏–æ–∑ –Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∏—Ö —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–∏—è–º–∏ –≤ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ-—Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —É–∫–ª–∞–¥–∞—Ö. –ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ —Ñ–∞—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–º —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç–∏–µ–º –æ–±–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –æ–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è (–±–µ—Ä–ª–∏–∫—Å–∫–∞—è –∏ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–æ–∑–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã) –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–æ—Ä–æ–≤, –≤ –º–µ–Ω—å—à–µ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ - –ª–æ—à–∞–¥–µ–π, –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–∞ –∂–µ –Ω–µ –∏–º–µ–ª–∞ —É –Ω–∏—Ö –∑–∞–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è. –û–±–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–æ–∑–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è (–∏—Ä–º–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞), –Ω–∞—Ä—è–¥—É —Å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –ª–æ—à–∞–¥–µ–π, –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏ –º–µ–ª–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–≥–∞—Ç–æ–≥–æ —Å–∫–æ—Ç–∞, –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω–∏—á—å–µ-–µ–∑–¥–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Å–æ–±–∞–∫, —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ —É–¥–µ–ª—è–ª–∏ –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –ª–æ—Å—è –∏ –¥–∏–∫—É—é –ª–æ—à–∞–¥—å, –ø—É—à–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–≤–µ—Ä–µ–π, –≤–æ–¥–æ–ø–ª–∞–≤–∞—é—â—É—é –ø—Ç–∏—Ü—É –∏ —Ä—ã–±–Ω–æ–π –ª–æ–≤–ª–µ. | ['molodin', 'vasiljev'] | ","['molodin', 'vasiljev']",3

192,"The Fox permafrost tunnel: A late Quaternary geologic record in central Alaska | The Fox permafrost tunnel, which penetrates 110 m into frozen sediments of Gold-stream valley, provides a continuous exposure of fossiliferous silt and alluvium above schistose bedrock. Deposition of fluvial gravel was followed by a long interval of loess accretion and permafrost aggradation that was punctuated by episodes of thaw and of gullying and redeposition of silt. Imbricated sandy gravel above the bedrock contains lenses of finer alluvium that contain wood fragments and some rooted stumps. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the gravel is older than 40 ka, but absence of mature soil and weathering profiles at its upper contact indicates that fluvial activity must have continued until shortly before loess accretion began at the tunnel site. Silt is the most widespread depositional unit in the tunnel. This deposit is of eolian origin (loess), but some has been redeposited by slope processes. The silt units contain abundant ground ice as pore filings, lenses, wedges, and buried pond ice. Loess accretion was interrupted by a period when little loess accumulated and when large ice wedges formed in the lower loess unit and subsequently were truncated by thaw. Loess began forming sometime before 40 ka and was rapidly accreting by 39 ka under xeric conditions with open vegetation. A sharply decreased rate of loess accretion associated with local erosion and thaw between about 36 and 30 ka is marked by anomalous cation concentration values, lenses of buried sod, fossils indicative of moist to wet substrates, and truncated ice wedges beneath small frozen ponds or streamlets that occupied ice-wedge troughs. A later episode of rapid loess influx under drier conditions began after 30 ka and coincided with glacial advances of late Wisconsin age in the adjoining Alaska Range. Large ice wedges also formed in the upper loess unit, but only their bases are exposed in the tunnel, and their history of development is uncertain. Fanlike deposits of poorly sorted debris near the tunnel portal formed between about 12.5 and 11 ka during deep erosion of loess slopes under moister conditions. The deposits locally form two subunits: the younger over- whelmed a stand of tall willows on the floor of Goldstream valley between about 11.3 and 11.1 ka; the older may have formed about 1,000 yr earlier. Stratigraphic records elsewhere in central Alaska indicate variable middle Wisconsin environments followed by colder and drier conditions that began between 30 and 25 ka and persisted until perhaps 12.5 ka. Widespread loess erosion and redeposition subsequently occurred under moister and probably warmer conditions. Renewed early Holocene loess deposition may have been widespread, but its exact environmental controls are uncertain. Our data challenge three generally accepted concepts of late Quaternary periglacial processes in central Alaska. We contend that (1) many ice-wedge systems may have formed under interstadial conditions rather than full-glacial conditions, (2) episodes of rapid loess influx may have been partly out of phase with episodes of glacier expansion, and (3) redeposition of loess by solifluction, sheetwash, and gully formation may have been episodic and required conditions moister than those under which the loess initially accreted. ¬© 1988 Geological Society of America. | ['craig', 'hamilton', 'sellmann'] | ","['craig', 'hamilton', 'sellmann']",1
193,"The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus L.) on the Kola Peninsula (Russia): silently disappearing in the mist of data deficiency? | The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus L.) population on the Kola Peninsula occupies an intermediate, and potentially connecting, position between foxes living on the Scandinavian Peninsula and populations further east in Russia, but very little is known about the status of this population. Here we summarize data from the literature, forgotten archival sources about research in the first half of the twentieth century, and the results of several independent expeditions undertaken over the past two decades. These materials include data on fur harvesting, incomplete monitoring data from official winter track counts of game animals, local knowledge, and our own observations. Our research revealed the extremely poor state of the Arctic fox population on the Kola Peninsula. According to our estimates, the current population is likely isolated and consists of no more than a few dozen adults. The fur return data, together with long-term data on small rodent abundance, suggest that irregular and fading out lemming cycles were a major driver of the Arctic fox population decline. The thorough research from the 1930s contrasts strongly with the lack of interest in studying and monitoring the population in recent decades, which is not even listed as a threatened species in the regional Red Data Book. In fact, the work performed here filled a more than a half-century gap in the study of the population and allowed us to determine the urgent need to resume research and immediately take active measures to protect and promote the recovery of the species in the region. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. | ['angerbj√∂rn', 'dal√©n', 'ehrich', 'panchenko', 'tirronen'] | ","['angerbj√∂rn', 'dal√©n', 'ehrich', 'panchenko', 'tirronen']",1

195,"To freeze or to dry: Seasonal variability in caribou processing and storage in the barrenlands of Northern Canada | This paper presents description and interpretation of 20 caribou bone assemblages from Inuit sites on the Kazan River in northern Canada. A diversity of features including caches, disposal areas, and surface scatters, are quantified in order to understand aspects of butchery, transport, and storage of caribou carcasses. Element distributions are compared to four published indices which quantify bone density, food utility, meat drying, and marrow, in order to understand which factors played important roles in decision-making by Inuit in the region. While several factors are identified as having affected these assemblages, by far the most important factor relates to the season during which the caribou were hunted. During warm seasons, the drying of meat dictated relatively complex division of the carcass for processing and storage. During colder seasons, on the other hand, rapid freezing of meat allowed for greater flexibility, which often simply meant that entire articulated carcasses were cached after skinning and gutting. | ['friesen', 'stewart'] | ","['friesen', 'stewart']",1
196,"Frozen Zoo: A collection of permafrost samples containing viable protists and their viruses | Background Permafrost, frozen ground cemented with ice, occupies about a quarter of the Earth's hard surface and reaches up to 1000 metres depth. Due to constant subzero temperatures, permafrost represents a unique record of past epochs, whenever it comes to accumulated methane, oxygen isotope ratio or stored mummies of animals. Permafrost is also a unique environment where cryptobiotic stages of different microorganisms are trapped and stored alive for up to hundreds of thousands of years. Several protist strains and two giant protist viruses isolated from permafrost cores have been already described. New information In this paper, we describe a collection of 35 amoeboid protist strains isolated from the samples of Holocene and Pleistocene permanently frozen sediments. These samples are stored at -18¬∞C in the Soil Cryology Lab, Pushchino, Russia and may be used for further studies and isolation attempts. The collection strains are maintained in liquid media and may be available upon request. The paper also presents a dataset which consists of a table describing the samples and their properties (termed ""Sampling events"") and a table describing the isolated strains (termed ""Occurrences"").

198,"Genetic diversity of historical Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) from Bjornoya and Haoya (Tusenoyane), Svalbard, Norway | Background: The population size of Atlantic walruses (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) is depleted relative to historical abundance levels. In Svalbard, centuries of over-exploitation brought the walrus herds to the verge of extinction, and such bottlenecks may have caused loss of genetic variation. To address this for Svalbard walruses, mitochondrial haplotypes of historical walruses from two major haul-out sites, Bjornoya and Haoya, within the Archipelago were explored using bone samples from animals killed during the peak period of harvesting. Results: Using ancient DNA methodologies, the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) gene, the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene, and the control region (CR) were targeted for 15 specimens from Bjornoya (of which five were entirely negative) and 9 specimens from Haoya (of which one was entirely negative). While ND1 and COI sequences were obtained for only a few samples, the CR delivered the most comprehensive data set, and the average genetic distance among historic Svalbard samples was 0.0028 (SD = 0.0023). Conclusions: The CR sequences from the historical samples appear to be nested among contemporary Atlantic walruses, and no distinct mitochondrial haplogroups were identified in the historical samples that may have been lost during the periods of extensive hunting. However, given the low sample size and poor phylogenetic resolution it cannot be excluded that such haplogroups existed. | ['aar', 'bachmann', 'kovacs', 'lindqvist', 'lydersen', 'roy', 'wiig'] | ","['aar', 'bachmann', 'kovacs', 'lindqvist', 'lydersen', 'roy', 'wiig']",4

Convergence in boreal and arctic cenoses leads to similarity in the morphology of karyologically remote forms. Genetic evidence has been obtained for the repeated existence of Beringian associations, exemplified by the distribution of the Palearctic genera Marmota, Citellus and Ochotona. Genetically confirmed cases of Beringian associations of mammals are also examined in stratigraphic succession. Cases of intracontinental disjunctions of ranges in Wisconsin (Ovis canadensis-Ovis dalli and Ochotona hyperborea) are studied. The directions of migrations were determined on the basis of genetic data. The gene frequency gradient is used to indicate the migration routes of Citellus parryi and C. undulatus. The genogeography of C. parryi transferrins is compared with the history of its range and distribution of fleas of the genus Oropsylla. -from Authors | ['lyapunova', 'vorontsov'] | ","['lyapunova', 'vorontsov']",1

203,"Geo-ethnoarchaeology in action | For over half of a century, ethnoarchaeology has served as an important analytical tool in the development of archaeological theory and the interpretation of human culture. In recent years, with the growth of geoarchaeology as a subdiscipline of archaeological research, scholars have begun to examine contemporary and recent contexts by applying analytical methods from the field of geosciences (e.g., soil micromorphology, mineralogical, elemental, phytolith and isotope analysis) in order to better understand site formation processes and depositional and post-depositional processes. First, this paper explores, as contributions to archaeological sciences, the concept of ethnoarchaeology in general and the emergence of geo-ethnoarchaeology in particular. Second, through examination and synthesis of several key case studies, this paper emphasizes the usefulness of a broad range of laboratory-based analytical methods in linking the archaeological record and human activity. Third, this paper brings together data from recent geo-ethnoarchaeological studies conducted in Africa, South and Central America, Europe and South and West Asia that analyze floor deposits, hearths, degradation of mud houses, use of space, use of plants, animal husbandry and cooking installations. A wealth of information is assembled here to form a reference framework crucial to any study of archaeological materials and sites and for the interpretation of archaeological site formation.

205,"Geologicheskoe III - the settlement of the Bronze Age (the materials of excavations I-III, V) | Introduction: since the 1980s in the archaeological study of the North of the Western Siberia an imbalance between the number of excavations and the publication of the obtained materials was fixed. It was determined by duration of preparation of new sources for the publication and the need of comprehension. The conducted research partly overcomes this identified gap. Objective: to publish Bronze the materials of the Bronze Age from the settlement Geologicheskoye III, one of the most fully studied the North of Western Siberia. It is situated in Sovetsky District of Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug - Yugra. The rivers Malaya Sosva, Tavda and Konda are located in this part of the Northern Sosva Upland. Research materials: are presented by the remnants of seven constructions of the Bronze Age, five of which are studied in this research work. Collection of ceramics of the Polymyat type, original molds, metal products, stone tools and animal bones are related to the dwellings. The article gives the characteristic of the found objects and findings; considers their analogs, allowing dating the researched complex. Results and novelty of the research: stratigraphic situations and distribution of the findings indicate about gradual building of the bank from its edge to the remotest part. The topography of the site and the content of the artifacts allow interpreting the settlement as a seasonal hunting camp of the taiga hunters and fishers. In addition to the main occupations the inhabitants of the settlement mined and processed stone raw material from local gravel; knew the simple techniques of metal casting in open molds; molded ceramics on technology of potters of the Southern Urals. Despite the remoteness from the main rivers Irtysh and Ob, the local population supported the multi-stage exchange of communication with the neighbors and received copper and bronze tools from them. On the other hand, a household utensil reflects the local specifics of the late Polymyat settlements. This is due to the strong influence of the Northern populations which left the Sartynya Culture of the Lower Ob Region River and the Arctic sites of Vary-Khadyta type. There is a possibility that they penetrated into the sources of the Konda River overcoming the watersheds. | ['koksharov'] | ",['koksharov'],4
206,"GIS-modeling of the Range Shifts of the Sub-fossil and Extant European Pond Turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Eastern Europe in Holocene | The study of the dynamics of the European pond turtle's Emys orbicularis range and distribution as an indicator of climate change in the past, present, and future is most relevant in connection with the protected status of this species in Europe. Based on our original finds, 25 archaeological sites yielding 1623 remains of 1504 individuals of subfossil pond turtles, current marginal distribution in Latvia, Ukraine, Russia, and literature data, we analyzed 437 records of Holocene turtles and 2847 current records of pond turtles. We identified areas that could serve as refugia for E. orbicularis, as a result of GIS modeling, while using 19 bioclimatic variables from the Worldclim and PaleoClim data bases. The data obtained confirm current hypotheses regarding the origin of more than 10 mtDNA lineages of E. orbicularis and the existence of multiple glacial refugia, and considerable Holocene home range dynamics. | ['nekrasova', 'pupins', 'tytar', 'yanish'] | ","['nekrasova', 'pupins', 'tytar', 'yanish']",1
207,"Glacial survival, post-glacial immigration, and a millennium of human impact: On search for a biogeography of Iceland | Northern Europe was capped by ice during Weichsel (Wurm), the maximum of which occurred approximately 18,000 years before present. When in the latter part of the 19(th) century the view of an all-devastating land ice (the tabula rasa hypothesis) was generally adopted by natural scientists, plant biogeographers used a simple model predicting a post-glacial, northwards re-migration of species in continental Europe. Occurrence and distribution of species were the prestige words when the flora and fauna elements of all area were described, and active and passive dispersal by wind, waves and migrating animals were considered. At the turn of the century observations of the distributions of certain plant species in the Scandinavian high mountains did not tally with the accepted tabula rasa and migration hypotheses. As the importance of long-distance dispersal was questioned as a general model to explain the occurrence of species, an alternative hypothesis was proposed that predicted the occurrence of sites (refuges) permitting glacial Survival of species (the refugium hypothesis). As Iceland has been covered by ice - the extent of which is under debate still - and its position in the middle of the Atlantic the occurrence of many species was difficult to explain without resting on the novel hypothesis. The controversy between the Scandinavian advocates of the two alternative hypotheses over time is reflected in the interpretations of field studies focussing oil the occurrence and distribution of the Icelandic biota.Man arrived in Iceland recently, i.e. at the end of the 9(th) century. His appearance and colonization implied that another means of dispersal and establishment of biota had to be considered: man was and,is a conveyor of species to and within the island. Moreover, lie settled, cultivated land, and he and his livestock, often freely grazing, transformed the landscape and affected abundance and distribution of species. To optimize the yield of his farm the farmer made and makes decisions oil a micro-level with bearing upon flora and fauna. But decisions that ultimately affect biota were and are also made on a macro-level e.g. by the Icelandic and foreign Governments (actions against soil erosion, trade barriers, price policy). The context in which decisions are made have to be regarded when we discuss the biogeography of Iceland. Rarely, it is possible to separate the impact of man from that of other agents and to evaluate his effects on the occurrence and distribution of species in most areas. Maybe Iceland is such an area where it would be possible, as man has affected the ecosystems during a rather short period and his doings can be followed in written sources. Such a study requires all integrated scientific approach and is not a matter of a single biologist but a team of skilled scholars and natural scientists. | ['rundgren'] | ",['rundgren'],1
208,"A global database on freshwater fish species occurrence in drainage basins | A growing interest is devoted to global-scale approaches in ecology and evolution that examine patterns and determinants of species diversity and the threats resulting from global change. These analyses obviously require global datasets of species distribution. Freshwater systems house a disproportionately high fraction of the global fish diversity considering the small proportion of the earth's surface that they occupy, and are one of the most threatened habitats on Earth. Here we provide complete species lists for 3119 drainage basins covering more than 80% of the Earth surface using 14953 fish species inhabiting permanently or occasionally freshwater systems. The database results from an extensive survey of native and non-native freshwater fish species distribution based on 1436 published papers, books, grey literature and web-based sources. Alone or in combination with further datasets on species biological and ecological characteristics and their evolutionary history, this database represents a highly valuable source of information for further studies on freshwater macroecology, macroevolution, biogeography and conservation. | ['beauchard', 'bigorne', 'blanchet', 'brosse', 'buisson', 'conti', 'cornu', 'dia', 'grenouillet', 'hugueny', 'jezequel', 'leprieur', 'oberdorff', 'tedesco'] | ","['beauchard', 'bigorne', 'blanchet', 'brosse', 'buisson', 'conti', 'cornu', 'dia', 'grenouillet', 'hugueny', 'jezequel', 'leprieur', 'oberdorff', 'tedesco']",4

The new taxon was previously cited in the literature as G. angustatum var. undulatum but this identification proved to be erroneous. Detailed morphology description of G. svalbardense based on light and scanning electron microscopy is presented in this paper and the morphological features of the taxon have been compared with similar species. Gomphonema svalbardense is characterized by its typical linear, almost naviculoid outline with undulating margins, with clearly inflated central part, asymmetric central area, lateral raphe with simple straight proximal endings and the weakly radiate striae. History, ecology and biogeography of the species, mainly based on literature data, have been included. | ['kopalova', 'pinseel', 'van', 'de', 'vijver'] | ","['kopalova', 'pinseel', 'van', 'de', 'vijver']",0
210,"The Great Bear Lake Its Place in History | Characteristics of the lake and environs, archaeology, ethnography and 19th-20th century history are presented. The lake, in N Canada, is the 8th largest and most northernly of the world's major lakes, and probably the least productive. The temperature of the water in the main part of the lake seldom rises above 4.degree. C. The various early inhabitants of the Great Bear Lake region appear collectively to have had their cultural origins in: the unglaciated south; Asia, migrating via the Bering Land Bridge (before its submersion) and the unglaciated regions of Alaska and the Yukon; and during certain periods, the true Arctic, as forerunners of the Eskimo. The local inhabitants tended to form a new grouping of lake-centered people to which the term Satudene, meaning ""bear water people"" has been applied. The tribes of the Satudene.sbd.the Hare, Mountain, Dogrib and Copper Indians.sbd.spoke dialects of the Athapascan family of languages which could be understood over wide areas. The Satudene were nomadic, and thus the establishment of permanent dwellings was precluded. Their fishing methods were varied, ranging from the use of hook and line to the building of stone weirs. The 1st known European establishment of Great Bear Lake was that constructed by Alexander McKenzie in 1799 for the North-West Fur Company. Up to the present time the lake waters are unpolluted and the fish stocks in much the same condition as 150 yr ago. However, changes are in the offing. Oil exploration is in progress in the basin, and the possibility is being examined of turning Great Bear Lake into a great reservoir to provide power for a generating station for electric power. | ['johnson'] | ",['johnson'],4
211,"The Arctic 'Great' Lakes of Canada and their fish faunas - An overview in the context of Arctic change | The present knowledge base and stressor status of 48 large (450 km(2) or greater in area) Arctic lakes in Canada are reviewed. The lakes occur from the southern territorial boundaries to the northern-most extent of land in the Archipelago, and range in area from 440-31,153 km(2). Productivities and species' complements established from proxy information indicate a declining trend from higher in the southwest Northwest Territories to lower in the northeast of Nunavut. Latitudinal and longitudinal variations in key present-day drivers (e.g., climate, surficial geology and associated nutrients) and historical factors (e.g., late Pleistocene peri-glacial processes) are likely responsible for these patterns. Despite their obvious significance in northern landscapes, knowledge is severely limited for all but a few of these lakes. Similarly, despite their remote locations, a wide range of stressors ranging from local in nature (e.g., industrial development) to pervasive and remotely driven (e.g., climate change) are very likely affecting the lakes and their associated fish faunas. Both the individual and cumulative effects of these stressors are nearly impossible to assess at present due to the dearth of knowledge. The risk of substantive effects occurring, however, is high. Comprehensive research in the near future is both desirable and required. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

213,"Heavy metal contamination in the Taimyr Peninsula, Siberian Arctic | The Taimyr Peninsula is directly north of the world's largest heavy metal smelting complex (Norilsk, Russia). Despite this proximity, there has been little research to examine the extent of contamination of the Taimyr Peninsula. We analyzed heavy metal concentrations in lichen (Cetraria cucullata), moss (Hylocomium splendens), soils, lake sediment, freshwater fish (Salvelinus alpinus, Lota lota and Coregonus spp.) and collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus) from 13 sites between 30 and 300 km from Norilsk. Element concentrations were low in both C. cucullata and H. splendens, although concentrations of Al, Fe, Cu, Ni and Pb were significantly higher than those in Arctic Alaska, probably due to natural differences in the geochemical environments. Inorganic surface soils had significantly higher concentrations of Cd, Zn, Pb and Mg than inorganic soils at depth, although a lake sediment core from the eastern Taimyr Peninsula indicated no recent enrichment by atmospherically transported elements. Tissue concentrations of heavy metals in fish and lemming were not elevated relative to other Arctic sites. Our results show that the impact of the Norilsk smelting complex is primarily localized rather than regional, and does not extend northward beyond 100 km. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

214,"Herpetofaunas from the ""overburden'' (Quaternary) of western Canada | Quaternary herpetofaunas from eight palaeontological localities in western Canada (British Columbia: Bear Flat; Alberta: Eagle Cave, January Cave, Rat's Nest Cave, Hand/Wintering Hills, Fletcher Site, Stampede Site and Little Fish Lake) are described in detail for the first time. Identifications of taxa from these localities include frogs (Rana sp., Bufo sp., and Anura indet.), salamanders (cf. Ambystoma sp.), and snakes (cf. Thamnophis sp. and cf. Pituophis sp.). Preglacial and postglacial herpetofaunas are distinctly separated by a boundary resulting from the advance and retreat of glacial ice across northern North America. The taxonomic records presented here represent a conservative, morphology-based approach to identification that resulted in less taxonomic resolution than is commonly found in literature on Quaternary herpetofaunas. Nonetheless, the resultant data set was useful for establishing a framework that is indicative of biogeographic stability in Quaternary reptiles and amphibians of western Canada. We hypothesise that the observed stability may be related to evolutionary adaptations (e.g. cold-tolerance) in specific lineages. | ['gardner', 'jass'] | ","['gardner', 'jass']",1
215,"Historical abundance and morphology of Didymosphenia species in Naknek Lake, Alaska | Since the 1980s, nuisance blooms of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt have been documented in sites that are warmer and more mesotrophic than historical records indicate. While the invasion of D. geminata in New Zealand is well documented, it is less clear whether nuisance blooms in North America are a new phenomenon. In order to test the hypothesis that D. geminata blooms have increased in recent years, we examined the historical record of this species in sediments of Naknek Lake, in Katmai National Park, Alaska. Chronological control was established by relating the presence of two ash layers to known volcanic eruptions. We identified two species of Didymosphenia within the sediment record: D. geminata and D. clavaherculis (Ehrenberg) Metzeltin et Lange-Bertalot. This is the first published record of D. clavaherculis in North America. We found no statistically significant change in the numerical presence of D. geminata or D. clavaherculis, as a group, in Naknek Lake between the years 1218 and 2003. While there has been no sudden, or recent, increase in abundance of Didymosphenia in Naknek Lake, morphological features of D. geminata populations in Naknek Lake are distinct compared to morphological features of D. geminata in streams containing nuisance blooms from sites in North America and New Zealand. Variance in the morphology of Didymosphenia cells may help determine relationships between distinct sub-populations and establish the history of habitat invasion. | ['finney', 'hermann', 'lane', 'pite', 'spaulding'] | ","['finney', 'hermann', 'lane', 'pite', 'spaulding']",0
216,"Historical Diversity of Cormorants and Shags from Amchitka Island Alaska | We studied the historical biodiversity of cormorants and shags in the central Aleutians by examining the presence and abundance of bones deposited in two large Aleut middens located on Amchitka Island, Alaska [USA]. The temporal range of discrete strata in these deposits was from Russian-era contact to about 2,650 years before present. We found six species in these middens: Pelagic, Red-faced, and Kenyon's Shags (Stictocarbo [Phalacrocorax] pelagicus, S. urile, S. kenyoni), Double-crested (Hypoleucus [Phalacrocorax] auritus), Japanese (Phalacrocorax capillatus) and Pallas's Cormorants (Compsohalieus [Phalacrocorax] perspicillatus), ranked in order of abundance. Historical patterns of abundance differed among species. Japanese and Pallas's Cormorants were most likely chance arrivals to the island; Double-crested Cormorants were not found post-contact and we hypothesize that Arctic Foxes may have extirpated them here; Pelagic and Red-faced Shags have remained in constant proportion over the years and abundances may relate to environmental or climatic change. Little is known about S. kenyoni. These results suggest that the diversity of the marine coastal avifauna has experienced dynamic change during the late Holocene and that the distributions of shags and cormorants in particular were different than now known. | ['lefevre', 'savinetskii', 'siegel', 'causey'] | ","['lefevre', 'savinetskii', 'siegel', 'causey']",4

218,"Historical ecology of late Holocene sea otters (Enhydra lutris) from northern British Columbia: Isotopic and zooarchaeological perspectives | We examined the isotopic composition (Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N) of sea otter (Enhydra lutris) bone collagen from ten late Holocene (ca. 5200 years BP-AD 1900) archaeological sites in northern British Columbia (BC), Canada. Because sea otters are now extinct from much of this region and have not fully recolonized their former range (e.g. Haida Gwaii and most of northern BC) these data represent an important first step towards better understanding sea otter foraging ecology in BC. The isotopic data suggest a diet composed primarily of benthic invertebrates, with a very low reliance on epibenthic fish. There is very low isotopic and thus inter-individual dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters during the late Holocene. Furthermore, zooarchaeological abundance data suggest that otters represented a widespread and significant focus of aboriginal hunting practices on the northern BC coast during the mid- to late-Holocene. The consistent reliance on a small number of low-trophic level prey and limited dietary variability in Holocene BC sea otters may reflect top-down impacts on otter populations by aboriginal peoples. As part of our assessment of sea otter diet, we review trophic discrimination factors (Œî13C and Œî15N) for bone collagen from published literature and find marked variability, with mean values of +3.7 ¬± 1.6 for Œî13C (n = 21) and +3.6 ¬± 1.3 for Œî15N (n = 15). ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. | ['gr√∂cke', 'mckechnie', 'orchard', 'szpak'] | ","['gr√∂cke', 'mckechnie', 'orchard', 'szpak']",1
219,"Historical and Geografic Factors of Intactness of the Primary Dark Coniferous Forests of Northern Ural | Searching for possible solutions to the problem of global climate change has led to rethinking of the role of undisturbed/primary/virgin forests, which have been subject only to natural disturbances for a long time. One of the priorities of the world environmental policy is the preservation of large unfragmented forests that perform ecosystem functions at the global level. However, to assess individual ecosystem functions, it is necessary to identify and thoroughly study the best preserved forest ecosystems, taking into account the history of traditional nature management. This article, based on historical and archival materials, describes in detail and localizes the main types of land use in the upper reaches of the Pechora River (Komi Republic) and identifies territories that have not been affected by economic activity over the past few centuries. Some areas were used by the indigenous population for hunting and as deer pastures. The extremely late date of settlement by Russian farmers and the a low population density led to the fact that only small plots (less than 0.2% of the area of the model basin) were transformed for agricultural needs. The lack of roads, developed markets and a sufficient amount of labor force constrained the growth of logging, and the creation of the Pechora-Ilych Nature Biosphere Reserve in 1930 stopped the further forest transformation. At present, the most transformed areas include light coniferous forests around former settlements, which have experienced repeated fires and reindeer grazing, as well as areas of overgrown farmland. The most powerful factors of forest transformation were anthropogenic fires that affected 8% of the area of the Upper Pechora river basin. The preserved intact forest ecosystems with a growing age of at least 600 years, located far from settlements and navigable rivers possess the greatest research value there. The results once again emphasize the role of historical information in understanding the modern forests dynamics and in assessing their conservation significance. –ü–æ–∏—Å–∫ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –≥–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª –∫ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–æ—Å–º—ã—Å–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é —Ä–æ–ª–∏ –Ω–µ–Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö/–ø–µ—Ä–≤–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö/–¥–µ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤, –¥–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –ø–æ–¥–≤–µ—Ä–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏—è–º. –û–¥–∏–Ω –∏–∑ –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–≤ –º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–æ–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∏ - —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–µ—Ñ—Ä–∞–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –º–∞—Å—Å–∏–≤–æ–≤, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è—é—â–∏—Ö —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–Ω—ã–µ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ –≥–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ –¥–ª—è –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–∏ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–π –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ –≤—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —Ç—â–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è –ª–µ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º —Å —É—á–µ—Ç–æ–º –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. –í —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–µ –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–æ–≤ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–æ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω—ã –∏ –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∏–¥—ã –∑–µ–º–ª–µ–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–æ–≤—å—è—Ö —Ä–µ–∫–∏ –ü–µ—á–æ—Ä—ã (—Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ö–æ–º–∏) –∏ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∑–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω—É—Ç—ã —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∑–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–π. –û—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∏ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –∫–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –¥–ª—è –æ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã –∏ –≤—ã–ø–∞—Å–∞ –æ–ª–µ–Ω–µ–π. –ö—Ä–∞–π–Ω–µ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–µ –∑–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∑–µ–º–ª–µ–¥–µ–ª—å—Ü–∞–º–∏ –∏ –Ω–∏–∑–∫–∞—è –ø–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–º, –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–ª–∏ –∫ —Ç–æ–º—É, —á—Ç–æ –ø–æ–¥ —Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ—Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –Ω—É–∂–¥—ã –±—ã–ª–∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∏ (–º–µ–Ω–µ–µ 0.2% –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ –º–æ–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–∞—Å—Å–µ–π–Ω–∞). –û—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥, —Ä—ã–Ω–∫–æ–≤ —Å–±—ã—Ç–∞ –∏ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–µ–π —Å–∏–ª—ã —Å–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏ —Ä–æ—Å—Ç –ª–µ—Å–æ–∑–∞–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ–∫, –∞ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ü–µ—á–æ—Ä–æ-–ò–ª—ã—á—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –≤ 1930 –≥. –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª–æ –¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–π—à–µ–µ –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤. –í –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∫ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞–º —Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ—Ç –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å —Å–≤–µ—Ç–ª–æ—Ö–≤–æ–π–Ω—ã–µ –ª–µ—Å–∞ –≤–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –±—ã–≤—à–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–π, –∏—Å–ø—ã—Ç–∞–≤—à–∏–µ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ–∂–∞—Ä—ã –∏ –≤—ã–ø–∞—Å –æ–ª–µ–Ω–µ–π, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∑–∞—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞—é—â–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª—ã–µ —Å–µ–ª—å—Ö–æ–∑—É–≥–æ–¥—å—è. –°–∞–º—ã–º –º–æ—â–Ω—ã–º —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ–∂–∞—Ä—ã, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∑–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω—É–ª–∏ 8% –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ –±–∞—Å—Å–µ–π–Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–∫–∏ –í–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–µ–π –ü–µ—á–æ—Ä—ã. –ù–∞–∏–±–æ–ª—å—à—É—é –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫—É—é —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–≤—à–∏–µ—Å—è –Ω–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω—É—Ç—ã–µ –ª–µ—Å–Ω—ã–µ —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã —Å –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–æ–º –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è –Ω–µ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ 600 –ª–µ—Ç, —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤–¥–∞–ª–∏ –æ—Ç –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –∏ —Å—É–¥–æ—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–µ–∫. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –µ—â–µ —Ä–∞–∑ –ø–æ–¥—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç —Ä–æ–ª—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤ –∏ –¥–ª—è –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–µ –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–æ–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏. | ['aleinikov'] | ",['aleinikov'],3
220,"Historical geography of pearl fishing in rivers of the southern white sea region (Arkhangelsk oblast) | The article provides an overview of literary and archival materials on the historical geography of pearl fishing, as well as a list of rivers of the Southern White Sea Region, where in the 17th-20th centuries pearls were mined. The most significant resources of pearls have been concentrated in the rivers Solza (with the tributary Kazanka) and Kozha (with the tributary Syvtuga) where there was regular and profitable trade of pearls for a long time. At present, pearl mussel populations have been preserved in these rivers, sometimes with a fairly high density. The volumes and frequency of pearl fishing can be indicators of shellfish abundance. ¬© Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2012. | ['bespalaya', 'bolotov', 'makhrov', 'vikhrev'] | ","['bespalaya', 'bolotov', 'makhrov', 'vikhrev']",0
221,Historical Nest Records for the Ferruginous Hawk Buteo-Regalis in Manitoba Canada | Seven previously unreported ferruginous hawk clutches from Manitoba were located in museum egg collections.

222,"Historical perspectives regarding the abundance of forest wildlife | The purpose of this study is to describe how people during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s qualitatively expressed the abundance of wildlife in Finland. In addition, it explores if (and how) these expressions indicate that people understood the basic principles of population dynamics (i.e. cycles) before the first Finnish studies focusing on this topic were carried out. The material consists of written comments by nature enthusiasts, hunters and wildlife tradesmen which can be found in the historical records of the Kuopio Naturalist's Society in eastern Finland. The observations on the decreasing red squirrel population at the end of the 1920s were typically expressed by people saying that the species in question is ''near the extinction"". People referred to the abundance of grouse with the terms few, few for sale, many, more than in the recent years, never been more for sale. Many expressions reveal that people detected the pattern of cyclicity in the population abundance both in time andspace and expressed it qualitatively much before the first quantitative studies, which provided support for this view. | ['kauppinen'] | ",['kauppinen'],1
223,"To History of Archaeozoology in Russia | The article presents a review on the development of Quarternary paleozoology and archaeozoology in Russia. Some data concern early publications in this field (the 18-19th centuries). The main attention is paid to leading scientific schools formed in the second half of the 20th century Specific features of developing this branch of zoology during the Soviet period in central and regional institutes, as well as in some republics of the USSR, are shown. The modern period of studies is characterized by the wide international cooperation and development of new methods for research. Some aspects of directions and levels of studies in the field of science considered are compared to those in the USA. | ['smirnov'] | ",['smirnov'],1
224,"A history of colonization and current status of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in the Faroe Islands | The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) breeds commonly in built-up areas throughout the Faroe Islands. The colonization began in the mid-1930s and the subsequent spread is described on the basis of previously published records, interviews with local people, and recent surveys of all habitations. Spatio-temporal pattern of spread is complex lending support to previous suggestions of possible, independent immigrations. It is suggested that the process of spread was influenced by the agency of man, geographical isolation (water-barriers and topography), and local conditions and population dynamics. Until now 80 % of the settlements (n = 118) have been more or less permanently colonized: first the larger ones (nearly all before 1960) and within 30-40 years c. 50% of those currently colonized (65% in the early 1980s). Total breeding population in 2001 and 2002 was estimated at c. 2,500 and 2,700 pairs, respectively; one-third being recorded in the capital Torshavn (90 pairs/km2). The numbers (total and local) have fluctuated (though precise historical data are scarce) but currently no trend is discernible. | ['bengtson', 'eliasen', 'jacobsen', 'magnussen'] | ","['bengtson', 'eliasen', 'jacobsen', 'magnussen']",1
225,"History of Development and Vegetation Cover of the Medvezhij Island in the Por‚Äôya Guba Bay of the White Sea | He Medvezhij Island is located in the central part of the Por‚Äôya Guba Bay and is one of the largest islands of the archipelago. In 1733, the first silver mine in Russia was founded on the Island, and for one and a half centuries the industrial development of deposits took place. The present-day vegetation is hi ghly diverse due to the influence of physical geographical and anthropogenic factors. The island is cover ed with boreal coniferous forests, tundra-like crowberry communities, mires with areas of different trophic status, diverse rocky vegetation and small fragments of coastal and anthropogenic meadows. As a result of th e study vegetation map of the island was compiled based on the ecological-morphological classification . Boreal forests are the predominant type of island vegetation. However, southern part of the island l acks forests, and tundra-like communities prevail there. Mire communities are characterized by extreme di versity and complex horizontal pattern. Most of the island forests are nominally primary, because they were cut down for supplying mine works and spontaneously regrew afterwards. Currently, forest stands of 120-160 years old prevail on the island, and there are also 60-80 year old stands. The oldest 250 years old trees are preserved in th e central part of the island, around the mires. Anthropogenic plant cenoses cover minor areas; sparse communit ies of apophytes (local flora species) replaced waste dumps, and anthropogenic meadows were formed in th e northwestern part of the island, at the site of former miners‚Äô settlement. 12 alien species were fou nd on the island. Probably, they were introduced during active mining operations in the 18 th and 19 th centuries and exist until now. Alien species inhabit the initial areas of introduction and do not tend to spread. At present the Medvezhij Island is part of the Kandalaksha State Nature Reserve, therefore new introduction of adventitious species is unlikely. –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂–∏–π —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –ü–æ—Ä—å–µ–π –≥—É–±—ã –∏ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ–¥–Ω–∏–º –∏–∑ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–ø–µ–ª–∞–≥–µ. –í 1733 –≥. –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –±—ã–ª –∑–∞–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π —Å–µ—Ä–µ–±—Ä—è–Ω—ã–π —Ä—É–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –∏ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–æ–ª—É—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤ –≤–µ–ª–∞—Å—å –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∞ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π. –°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏–º —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–µ–º, —á—Ç–æ –æ–±—É—Å–ª–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ–º –∫–∞–∫ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–æ-–≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤. –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ø–æ–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –±–æ—Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ö–≤–æ–π–Ω—ã–µ –ª–µ—Å–∞, —Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ –≤–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∏–∫–∏, –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π –º–∞—Å—Å–∏–≤ —Å —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞–º–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–π —Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∞—è —Å–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏ –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ —Ñ—Ä–∞–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –ø—Ä–∏–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ª—É–≥–æ–≤. –ü–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–º —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç, –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ-–º–æ—Ä—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞. –ü—Ä–µ–æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—é—â–∏–º —Ç–∏–ø–æ–º —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –±–æ—Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –ª–µ—Å–∞, –æ–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ —é–∂–Ω–∞—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –ª–∏—à–µ–Ω–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏: –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –≥–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç —Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –í—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏–º —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–µ–º –∏ —Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω–æ–π –≥–æ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä–æ–π –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –ë–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ-–∫–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏, –ø–æ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫—É –æ–Ω–∏ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏—Å—å —Å–ø–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω–æ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–ª—è –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –≤—ã—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–æ–∫. –í –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –Ω–∞ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∏ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–æ–º 120-160 –ª–µ—Ç, –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –º–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∏ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–æ–º 60-80 –ª–µ—Ç. –ù–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–µ –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å—è, –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–æ–º –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 250 –ª–µ—Ç, —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞, –ø–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏–∏ –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Å—Å–∏–≤–∞. –†–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—é—Ç –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏: –Ω–∞ –º–µ—Å—Ç–µ –æ—Ç–≤–∞–ª–æ–≤ –ø—É—Å—Ç–æ–π —Ä—É–¥—ã —Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –∏–∑ –∞–ø–æ—Ñ–∏—Ç–æ–≤ (—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–π —Ñ–ª–æ—Ä—ã), –∞ –≤ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–æ-–∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞, –Ω–∞ –º–µ—Å—Ç–µ –±—ã–≤—à–µ–≥–æ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–∫–∞ —Ä—É–¥–æ–¥–æ–±—ã—Ç—á–∏–∫–æ–≤, - —Å—É—Ö–æ–¥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –ª—É–≥–∞. –ù–∞ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–æ 12 –∑–∞–Ω–æ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ, –≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–Ω–æ, –≤–Ω–µ–¥—Ä–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –≤ –µ–≥–æ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ä—É –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –≥–æ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç –≤ XVIII –∏ XIX –≤–≤. –∏ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—è—é—Ç—Å—è –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –¥–æ —Å–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ä. –ó–∞–Ω–æ—Å–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∏–¥—ã –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è, –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º, –≤ –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ö –∑–∞–Ω–æ—Å–∞ –∏ –Ω–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—è—é—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—É. –í –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ú–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂–∏–π –≤—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –≤ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤ –ö–∞–Ω–¥–∞–ª–∞–∫—à—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞, –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å —á–µ–º —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–Ω–æ—Å –∞–¥–≤–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –º–∞–ª–æ–≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–µ–Ω. | ['kozhin', 'kudr'] | ","['kozhin', 'kudr']",3
226,"The history of early cereal cultivation in northernmost Fennoscandia as indicated by palynological research | The age of the introduction of cereal cultivation in northern Europe has long been debated by researchers from many disciplines, in particular archaeology and palaeoecology. Over the past 40 years extensive palynological data have been collected concerning pre-industrial land use in northern Fennoscandia. This paper reviews palynological studies that include records of fossil cereal pollen from northernmost Sweden, Finland and Norway at latitudes north of 63A degrees N. The geographical extent of known early cultivation sites is constantly expanding, with more than 100 records of cereal pollen pre-dating ad 1700. The oldest records of scattered cereal pollen derive from Neolithic times. Periods of continuous cultivation, indicated by cereal pollen recorded recurrently in the sediment profiles, derive from the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Collectively, the reviewed pollen records indicate that cereal cultivation was first introduced into areas close to the coast and later to the interior, and that it may have been practiced locally long before sedentary settlements based on intensive cultivation were established during medieval times. The data do not indicate a latitudinal spread of cultivation from south to north. However, methodological problems relating to pollen morphology of cereals, site characteristics and lack of connections to archaeologically excavated sites imply that the value of many early cereal pollen finds remains unclear. To increase our understanding of the context in which cereal cultivation was introduced in northernmost Fennoscandia, multidisciplinary studies integrating palaeoecology, archaeology and history are needed. | ['hornberg', 'josefsson', 'ramqvist'] | ","['hornberg', 'josefsson', 'ramqvist']",1

228,"A history of organized persecution and conservation of wildlife: species categorizations in Finnish legislation from medieval times to 1923 | Attitudes towards wild animals are reflected through history in various categorizations of species. For example, changes in the useful-harmful dichotomy of species have affected policy decisions during the long history of organized pest persecution as well as during the much more recent rise of nature conservation. The first hunting legislation in Finland dates back more than 650 years, to times when the country belonged to the Kingdom of Sweden. From those times to the early 20th century various acts of law exhibited a marked variation in placing species into useful and harmful categories. The dichotomy seems to be based upon fundamental ecological interactions between humans and other species. We show that the varying interest in pest persecution as well as important conservation milestones have been associated with contemporary human-animal relations such as the attitudes of decision makers and laymen towards wild animals, and the public awareness of species conservation issues. | ['mykra', 'pohja', 'mykra', 'vuorisalo'] | ","['mykra', 'pohja', 'mykra', 'vuorisalo']",4
229,"On the history and quaternary scientific significance of peat stratigraphical research in the North countries | The early development of peat stratigraphical research was concentrated in the Nordic countries. Although this field of science originated in Denmark at the beginning of the 19th century, the most important pioneer of palaeoecological peatland research was the Norwegian, Axel Blytt. His model, as modified by the Swedish scientist Rutger Sernander, spread throughout Europe and from there to other continents and has had a major impact on peat stratigraphy and Quaternary science. However, our present knowledge of the regional differences in postglacial vegetation and climate history speaks against the use of the Blytt-Sernander scheme outside southern Scandinavia. Especially, the compulsive application of the Blytt-Sernander scheme in the zoning of pollen diagrams has lead to distortions and erroneous interpretations. | ['seppa'] | ",['seppa'],1
230,"History of sedentary farming in Angermanland, northern Sweden, during the Iron Age and Medieval period based on pollen analytical investigations | Compared with most parts of Europe, northern Sweden is essentially a sparsely populated wilderness. There is, however, an ever increasing body of archaeological and palaeoecological information that shows that the region has a long cultural history. In this paper, results of pollen analytical investigations from four lakes with varved lake sediments, in the province of Angermanland, are presented. These investigations have yielded evidence of continuous and sedentary agriculture from the 6th century in the region close to the Bothnian coast and near the mouth of the large river Angermanalven. This early agriculture appears to have been based on animal husbandry and cereal, mainly barley, cultivation. During a second farming expansion phase at ca. A.D. 1200, rye cultivation became more important. The increased farming activity during this period was most pronounced at the coast and in the river valley, but more peripheral regions away from the river valley were also exploited. During the period A.D. 1600-1800, arable farming assumed greater importance. In the first decades of the 20th century, the area under cultivation declined, cereal cultivation mostly ceased and the fields were used for pasture. | ['wallin'] | ",['wallin'],4
231,"History of Spread of the Beech Scale, Cryptococcus fagi (Baerensprung), an Insect introduced into the Maritime Provinces | The author describes and illustrates on a map the westward spread of Cryptococcus fagi [Cryptococcus fagisuga], Baer., on beech in the Maritime Provinces of Canada from 1890 to 1942 [cf. R.A.E., A 22 393; 32 327] and discusses some of the factors governing its dispersal and its effect on beech there. It has also been observed in the United States, in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York [cf. 30 174]. Reproduction is parthenogenetic, and there is one generation a year [cf. 22 394]. The eggs are deposited in summer and the young sometimes crawl considerable distances over the tree before settling. A light infestation causes no appreciable injury, but a heavy one results in the death of patches of bark and sometimes of the cambium. A fungus (Nectria [coccinea]) invades areas where the scale has been feeding in large numbers and assists in killing trees and causing scars [cf. 22 497]. Ways in which the Coccid has been spread are briefly reviewed [cf. 22 394]; factors that are considered to have favoured its dispersal are that stands of beech are common in the Maritime Provinces; that it multiplies rapidly; that it is not adequately controlled by natural enemies, though it is attacked by several predators, particularly Chilocorus stigma, Say (bivulnerus, Muls.), and attempts to establish more effective predators from Europe have proved unsuccessful; and that although it is apparently favoured somewhat by a coastal climate, it can withstand the more severe winter conditions of the interior. | ['hawboldt'] | ",['hawboldt'],4

233,"Human-environment dynamics during the Iron Age in the Lofoten Islands, Norway | Integrated archaeological and paleoenvironmental investigations provide long-term perspectives on human-environment interactions. In the North Atlantic region, early human settlements were established in marginal agricultural environments and were susceptible to various environmental stressors. The Lofoten Islands have had an important role in the history of this region, particularly during the Iron Age, when Lofoten developed from pioneering agricultural settlements to a prominent node of power and trade under Viking chieftains. Iron Age developments in Lofoten were concurrent with significant natural environmental changes, including variations in climate and sea level. However, there has not been a comprehensive investigation of their influence on early settlements. The purpose of the study is to review Iron Age cultural developments in Lofoten using published archaeological data and paleoenvironmental records of past climate and sea-level change, and to present specific examples of the intersection of early human development and natural environmental changes. The findings show that climate changes probably influenced agricultural phases and that relative sea-level variations had important impacts on maritime developments. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that human-environment interactions were significant factors in Lofoten's history and the authors suggest specific areas for future research. | ['balascio', 'wickler'] | ","['balascio', 'wickler']",1

235,"Human paleoecological integration in subarctic eastern Beringia | We contribute to the understanding of megafauna extinction and human dispersal in subarctic eastern Beringia by focusing on changes in the trophic dynamics of the large mammal community as well as the ecological role of humans as a predator and competitor. We reconstruct habitat use by megafauna and humans throughout the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary based on zooarchaeological data and stable isotope ratios of collagen. Our results are consistent with habitat heterogeneity and availability being important factors in the changing abundance of large herbivores. We argue that an increase in herbivore diversity and biomass at the beginning of the Bolling-Allerod interstadial and a relative lack of competitors favored the initial human colonization of subarctic eastern Beringia. As herbivore resources dwindled later in the Late Glacial, people increasingly relied on bison and wapiti. By efficiently extracting some of the highest-ranked resources in the landscape, people are likely to have contributed to the trophic displacement or regional extirpation of other large predators. The ecological patterns that we observe in subarctic eastern Beringia are consistent with a mixture of both top-down and bottom-up controls over biotic turnover. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

236,"Human resilience and resettlement among the Islands of Four Mountains, Aleutians, Alaska | Combined archaeological, ecological, and geologic research on Chuginadak and Carlisle Islands in the Islands of Four Mountains (IFM) probed questions about the sustainability of human settlements over the past 4000 years in the face of geologic, ecological, and social hazards. We use a human ecodynamics approach to frame the investigation and present original archaeological evidence from this poorly known region of the remote Aleutian Islands. Several village sites occupied during the last four millennia are clustered in locations that were not damaged by earthquake-induced tsunamis; however, new geologic evidence indicates that at least one volcanic eruption forced humans to abandon one or more prehistoric village sites. Combined archaeological, ecological, and geologic analyses demonstrate resilient Unangax occupations of the IFM through long-term climate change as well as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions with occasional community vulnerability to volcanic eruptions. | ['bruner', 'hatfield', 'khasanov', 'krylovich', 'macinnes', 'nicolaysen', 'okuno', 'persico', 'savinetsky', 'vasyukov', 'west'] | ","['bruner', 'hatfield', 'khasanov', 'krylovich', 'macinnes', 'nicolaysen', 'okuno', 'persico', 'savinetsky', 'vasyukov', 'west']",4
237,"Hunters, herders and hearths: interpreting new results from hearth row sites in Pasvik, Arctic Norway | The transition from hunting to reindeer herding has been a central topic in a number of archaeological works. Recently conducted archaeological investigations of two interior hearth row sites in Pasvik, Arctic Norway, have yielded new results that add significantly to the discussion. The sites are dated within the period 1000-1300 AD, and are unique within this corpus due to their rich bone assemblages. Among the species represented, reindeer is predominant (87 %), with fish (especially whitefish and pike) as the second most frequent category. Even sheep bones are present, and represent the earliest indisputable domesticate from any Sami habitation site. A peculiar feature is the repeated spatial pattern in bone refuse disposal, showing a systematic and almost identical clustering at the two sites. Combining analysis of bone assemblages, artefacts and archaeological features, the paper discusses changes in settlement pattern, reindeer economies, and the organization of domestic space. | ['hedman', 'olsen', 'vretemark'] | ","['hedman', 'olsen', 'vretemark']",1
238,"Hunting Technologies and Archaeofaunas: Societal Differences Between Hunter-Gatherers of the Eastern Arctic | This paper investigates human-animal interaction in two very different hunter-gatherer societies, Late Dorset and Thule Inuit, who once occupied the eastern Arctic (Canadian Arctic and Greenland). I focus on their disparate hunting technologies in order to achieve a nuanced understanding on how cultural factors influenced this relationship and to ultimately better understand why Late Dorset disappeared from the archeological record. I assess how hunting technologies impacted each society's archaeofaunas and describe what appear to be culturally distinct trends in the faunal remains. In light of these findings, differences between Late Dorset and Thule Inuit hunting strategies, and other societal aspects including labor organization, hierarchy, and food provisioning are considered. This research discusses how generalized versus specialized hunting technologies impacted the social trajectory of each society, and methodologically, it provides a case study for how the use of specialized technologies can be viewed in the archeological record. | ['howse'] | ",['howse'],1

The earliest information of animal husbandry is dated at Hustad to around 3600 BP and at Naurstad, further northeast along the fjords, to 2S00BP. Pine and birch forest disappeared from the outermost areas and an open heather landscape developed during the Migration Period. Arstad was settled in the Viking Age, while Naurstad and Hustad were definitely settled as local farms from 1500 BP at the latest. Hustad has been in continuous use during the last 1500 years, while during Medieval time Naurstad, probably experienced a short break, and Arstad was abandoned.

240,"Iarte VI and Late Holocene Reindeer Remains from the Iamal Peninsula of Arctic Siberia | Rangifer tarandus is one of the most important animals for indigenous groups living in the Arctic. This significance is particularly the case in the Iamal Peninsula of the Russian Federation. The Iamal Peninsula has produced a substantial archaeological record of human engagement with reindeer during the Late Holocene period. The archaeological site known as Iarte VI, a multihousepit settlement on the open tundra of the peninsula, has produced the region's largest and most well-dated reindeer-bone assemblage. This study provides a chronological assessment of Iarte VI based on numerous radiocarbon and dendrochronology dates, an analysis of the site's large faunal assemblage, and comparison of these remains with those from all other sampled sites on the peninsula. Iarte VI appears to have been a warm-season settlement where reindeer were intensively utilized during the 11th century AD. Other regional sites had broader subsistence practices, but reindeer are nonetheless consistently present. | ['losey', 'mcintyre', 'nomokonova', 'plekhanov'] | ","['losey', 'mcintyre', 'nomokonova', 'plekhanov']",4
241,"""I'd Be Foolish to Tell You They Were Caribou"": Local Knowledge of Historical Interactions between Reindeer and Caribou in Barrow, Alaska | This study aims to understand the role of caribou in the decline of Barrow, Alaska's reindeer industry and the fate of reindeer that joined caribou herds. During the reindeer herding era, 1898-1951, changes in the abundance and distribution of native caribou led to interactions with the introduced domestic reindeer. Herders remember losing their reindeer when the animals joined migrating caribou herds. Oral histories reveal a mismatch between herders struggling to prevent their reindeer from joining caribou herds and administrators who assumed that caribou problems could be eliminated through more careful herding. Hunter observations since the demise of herding suggest that some reindeer-like animals persist in caribou herds.

The identification of bird species used by ancient hunters as long ago as 4500 BP enhances our insight into the customs, culture, and sophistication of life at that time. Downy feather barbs were found on two samples and microscopically identified as duck (Anatidae) and falcon (Falconidae). Further examination and comparisons using museum specimens resulted in a total of six identifications: Anatidae, eagle (Aquila or Haliaeetus), gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), and northern flicker (Colaptes auratus luteus). Three of the feather samples were complete enough to show apparent modification, or notching, along the feather shaft. The identification of non-game birds such as gyrfalcon and eagles, together with evidence of possible worked or notched feathers, indicates that as long as 4500 years ago, Subarctic hunters selected feathers not only for their utility in fletching, but also possibly for symbolic or decorative purposes. | ['dove', 'hare', 'heacker'] | ","['dove', 'hare', 'heacker']",1

244,"Identifying early stages of reindeer domestication in the archaeological record: a 3D morphological investigation on forelimb bones of modern populations from Fennoscandia | Reindeer herding probably developed during the Late Iron Age onwards and is still an important part of the subsistence and culture of many peoples in northern Eurasia. However, despite the importance of this husbandry in the history of these Arctic people, the period and place of the origin as well as the spread of domestic reindeer is still highly debated. Besides the existence of different breeding methods in these territories, identifying domesticated individuals in the archaeological record is complicated because reindeers are considered to still be in the early phases of the domestication process. Indeed, the traditional morphological markers used in zooarchaeology to decipher the domestication syndrome are hardly perceptible in these early stages. In this work, we propose solutions for identifying domestic reindeer bones using 3D geometric morphometrics on isolated elements from the long bones of the forelimb (i.e. humerus, radio-ulna and metacarpal). These bones are important to understand both the feeding behaviour and the mobility of reindeer, and the potential effect of load-carrying or draught in the case of domestic reindeer. We analysed 123 modern specimens from Fennoscandia, including the two interbreeding subspecies currently present in these territories: mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and forest reindeer (R.t. fennicus); and where the sex and the lifestyle were known (i.e. free-ranging, racing or draught and captive individuals). A good level of discrimination between the size and shape variables of the bones of the forelimb was found among both subspecies and sexes. Moreover, individuals bred in captivity had smaller bone elements and a thinner and more slender morphology than free-ranging individuals. This demonstrates that the long bones of the forelimb can provide information on changes in feeding and locomotor behaviour prompted by the domestication process, like control and/or reduction of mobility and food of individual reindeer by humans. This also demonstrates that analysis in 3D geometric morphometrics is useful in detecting reindeer incipient domestication markers. Our results can be used by archaeologists to trace the early stages of domestication from fossil reindeer remains, and aid in reconstructing the socio-economic changes of past Arctic populations over time. | ['kotiaho', 'niinimaki', 'pelletier', 'salmi'] | ","['kotiaho', 'niinimaki', 'pelletier', 'salmi']",4
245,"Immigration routes of Dryas integrifolia and D-octopetala to Greenland as inferred from their associated fungi | Observations on fungi growing on Dryas integrifolia and D. octopetala are used as a complementary method to explain the distribution of these two species in Greenland. Data confirming the hypothesis that D. integrifolia survived the last glaciation on nunataks and that D. octopetala probably immigrated later after the last glaciation are presented. Thirty-three species of fungi were found on the two species of Dryas. The distribution and host specificity of these fungi are used to establish three groups: Dryas-specific fungi, Dryas integrifolia-specific fungi and plurivorous fungi. No D. octopetala-specific fungi were found. Analyses indicate that neighbouring regions in Greenland are most similar with regard to Dryas-specific fungi. No relationship between the distribution of plurivorous fungi and geographical distance were found. Similarities and differences in the distribution of the three fungal groups are discussed and compared with other evidence for the immigration of Dryas into Greenland. The possible role of endemics on Dryas as well as fungal distribution supporting theories about refugia are discussed. | ['chlebicki', 'knudsen', 'olejniczak'] | ","['chlebicki', 'knudsen', 'olejniczak']",1
246,"THE IMPACT of CLIMATE CHANGE IN HOLOCENE ON THE FORMATION OF CONTEMPORARY FOREST VARIETY AND THEIR TRANSFORMATION BY THE END OF THE 21 CENTURY IN EUROPEAN RUSSIA | The set of the complex historical processes that began in European Russia since the end of the Wurm stage of Valdai glaciations, about 12000 years ago, has become a prerequisite for the migration of forest vegetation occurring at different times and its attendant complexes to the north following the retreat of glaciers and glacial waters. The most intensive settlement of dark taiga and broad-leaved trees (oak, linden, elm, hazel, maple) occurred in the phase of ‚Äúthermal maximum‚Äù of early boreal and late Atlantic Holocene periods. The formation of the contemporary forest vegetation was the result of natural conditions changes affecting the composition of the vegetation and zoning in the forests of the taiga and nemoral strip. It is most likely for different groups of flora species to penetrate to the north of European Russia from the south, east and west by several migration waves. By the end of the 21 century, the degradation of the ice cover in the Arctic will take place, as well as the transformation of zone borders in the sub-arctic and boreal landscapes, the area change of the permafrost species and the dynamics of the polar forest limit, which has already been observed in the present.Global warming will affect the transformation of biodiversity of flora and fauna complexes in all ecosystems. The changes will affect not only the internal structure of forest communities and the migration of southern species to the north, but also the zonal differentiation of stands composition. The number of birch and aspen will increase in the undergrowth of the taiga zone. The role of spruce will decrease which will be replaced by birch, pine sites, broad-leaved trees (oak, hornbeam, beech, linden).The strip of nemoral forests will expand and take partially the territory of modern taiga and steppe. The migration of mammals is forecasted. Such taiga species as wild boar, elk, deer will move to the north beyond the present natural habitat, and the number of reindeer and Arctic foxes will be reduced. Some steppe species of birds and animals will enrich the fauna to the north of their present natural habitat. –í —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–π –ª–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ —Å–æ–ø—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏—Ö –µ–π –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä –≤—Å–ª–µ–¥ –∑–∞ –æ—Ç—Å—Ç—É–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–¥, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ—Å—ã–ª–∫–æ–π –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –≤—ã—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª–∞ —Å–æ–≤–æ–∫—É–ø–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ã—Ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ–≤, –Ω–∞—á–∞–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è –≤ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Å –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞ –≤—é—Ä–º—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–∏ –í–∞–ª–¥–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–ª–µ–¥–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 12 000 –ª–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥. –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω—Å–∏–≤–Ω–æ–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–µ–º–Ω–æ—Ö–≤–æ–π–Ω–æ–π —Ç–∞–π–≥–∏ –∏ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥ (–¥—É–±, –ª–∏–ø–∞, –≤—è–∑, –ª–µ—â–∏–Ω–∞, –∫–ª—ë–Ω) –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ –≤ —Ñ–∞–∑—ã ¬´—Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º—É–º–æ–≤¬ª —Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–µ–±–æ—Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏ –ø–æ–∑–¥–Ω–µ–∞—Ç–ª–∞–Ω—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–æ–≤ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞. –§–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –ª–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ —Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ–º —Å–º–µ–Ω –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–π, –ø–æ–≤–ª–∏—è–≤—à–∏—Ö –Ω–∞ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –∏ –∑–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤ –ª–µ—Å–∞—Ö —Ç–∞–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π –∏ –Ω–µ–º–æ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ—Å—ã. –î–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –¥–ª—è —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ —Ñ–ª–æ—Ä—ã –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–Ω–æ –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —Å —é–≥–∞, –≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ –∏ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–∞ –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–∏–º–∏ –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –≤–æ–ª–Ω–∞–º–∏. –ö –∫–æ–Ω—Ü—É XXI –≤–µ–∫–∞ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å –¥–µ–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞—Ü–∏—è –ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –≤ –ê—Ä–∫—Ç–∏–∫–µ, —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è –∑–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä—É–±–µ–∂–µ–π –≤ —Å—É–±–∞—Ä–∫—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –±–æ—Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–Ω–¥—à–∞—Ñ—Ç–∞—Ö, –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–º—ë—Ä–∑–ª—ã—Ö –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –∏ –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ –ø–æ–ª—è—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞ –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤, —á—Ç–æ —É–∂–µ –Ω–∞–±–ª—é–¥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è. –°–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥ –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –ø–æ—Ç–µ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –±–∏–æ—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏—è —Ñ–ª–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ —Ñ–∞—É–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–æ–≤ –≤–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ö —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ö. –ò–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–æ—Å–Ω—É—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä—ã –ª–µ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –∏ –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —é–∂–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä, –Ω–æ –∏ –∑–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏—Ñ—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ–≤. –í –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–µ —Ç–∞–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π –∑–æ–Ω—ã —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–∏—Ç—Å—è —á–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –±–µ—Ä–µ–∑—ã –∏ –æ—Å–∏–Ω—ã. –£–º–µ–Ω—å—à–∏—Ç—Å—è —Ü–µ–Ω–æ—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–æ–ª—å –µ–ª–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –∑–∞–º–µ—â–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –±–µ—Ä—ë–∑–æ–π, –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞–º–∏ —Å–æ—Å–Ω–æ–π, —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞–º–∏ (–¥—É–±, –≥—Ä–∞–±, –±—É–∫, –ª–∏–ø–∞). –ü–æ–ª–æ—Å–∞ –Ω–µ–º–æ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤ —Ä–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä–∏—Ç—Å—è –∏ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ –∑–∞–π–º–µ—Ç —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Ç–∞–π–≥–∏ –∏ —Å—Ç–µ–ø–∏. –ü—Ä–æ–≥–Ω–æ–∑–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –º–ª–µ–∫–æ–ø–∏—Ç–∞—é—â–∏—Ö. –¢–∞–∫–∏–µ —Ç–∞–µ–∂–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∏–¥—ã, –∫–∞–∫ –¥–∏–∫–∏–π –∫–∞–±–∞–Ω, –ª–æ—Å—å, –∫–æ—Å—É–ª—è –ø—Ä–æ–¥–≤–∏–Ω—É—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—ã —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∞—Ä–µ–∞–ª–∞, –∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –æ–ª–µ–Ω—å –∏ –ø–µ—Å–µ—Ü —Å–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç—è—Ç —Å–≤–æ—é —á–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –ß–∞—Å—Ç—å —Å—Ç–µ–ø–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –ø—Ç–∏—Ü –∏ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –æ–±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—è—Ç —Ñ–∞—É–Ω—É —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–µ–µ —Å–≤–æ–µ–≥–æ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∞—Ä–µ–∞–ª–∞. | ['konstantinov', 'sergienko'] | ","['konstantinov', 'sergienko']",3

Lovelius on the basis of 5 models (series I, 1756-1969) and later 8 models (series II, 1711-1964) were criticized. Series II did not permit detailed criticism, since it represented only every 15th year. An independent dendrochronological study using 18 models was conducted to discover and evaluate any discrepancies in Lovelius's series. Due to a superficial approach and an inadequate understanding of the application, technique and exacting standards of dendrochronology, Lovelius' series I was 75% correct between 1886-1969 and only 54% correct between 1756-1885. Conclusions or hypotheses based on such a study should be avoided. Such careless and misleading studies are made possible by several factors: they lack organization and collaboration, most are still conducted by individuals without benefit of supervision or essential equipment, and foreign advances in this complex and exacting field are often not utilized. Dendrochronological studies are published in the absence of any stringent quality standards. | ['shiyatov'] | ",['shiyatov'],4
248,"Information Achievements of Prehistory in the Panorama of Archaeological Cultures in the Urals and Western Siberia | Our focus is the type of responses the population of the taiga zone of the Urals and Western Siberia gave to cognitive challenges, as well as dynamics and rhythms of information breakthroughs of the Stone-Early Iron Age. The existence of multi-directional migration corridors indicated formation of an extremely diverse anthropological, linguistic and cultural composition of the taiga pioneer population, thus creating natural communication barriers in the context of severe inter-group competition for resources. Against this background, in the Neolithic (7th-5th millenniums BC), a practice of building fortified settlements, hill-forts, and ‚Äúsacrificial hills‚Äù became widespread - and that was not typical of hunters and fishermen. Erection of those complex and labor-consuming structures required mobilization of a significant number of people, as well as resources and expertise, and contributed to group consolidation in a new territory. It was that type of dramatic disruption that occurred at the turn of the 3rd and 2nd millenniums BC. Considerable changes in the way of life of the taiga population came as a direct result of the ‚Äúmetallurgical revolution‚Äù. The development of independent metallurgical centers in the Middle Urals traditional ideas about the inability of the population of the appropriating lifestyle to adopt transformative strategies. The northernmost regions became another watershed in the region. The turn of the Eras was marked by development in reindeer herding, which was accompanied by a series of discoveries in the fields of food production, transport development, communications, trade, and symbolic activities. Archaeological data directly indicate the formation of adequate responses and information breakthroughs to the cognitive challenges of the high latitudes of Eurasia, and explain the variety of forms of socio-ideological adaptations and evolutionary alternatives. | ['korochkova'] | ",['korochkova'],1

251,"Insect analysis | The study of fossil insect remains from archaeological sites is adding vital new information on human lifestyles and living conditions, as well as providing evidence on the environmental setting of these sites. The principal types of deposits that yield insect remains are waterlogged sediments that are rich in organic detritus. Such deposits have typically been studied in ancient human habitation sites ranging from Bronze Age to Medieval times, especially in Europe. Insects directly associated with human-created environments include stored product pests, human and livestock parasites, and warm-adapted detritus feeders that would not have been able to survive out of doors in northern latitudes. These warm-adapted species were transported as far north as Iceland and Greenland, along with cargo on ships originating in Mediterranean ports. The sedentary lifestyles of Europeans from the Bronze Age onwards led to the accumulation of insect-rich organic deposits. In contrast to this, the hunter-gatherer populations of most of the Americas led a migratory lifestyle. Accordingly, the fossil insect faunal assemblages associated with most New World archaeological sites represent natural, 'outdoor' habitats, rather than man-made, 'indoor' habitats. ¬© 2008 Copyright ¬© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

252,"The Intcal20 Northern Hemisphere Radiocarbon Age Calibration Curve (0-55 Cal Kbp) | Radiocarbon (C-14) ages cannot provide absolutely dated chronologies for archaeological or paleoenvironmental studies directly but must be converted to calendar age equivalents using a calibration curve compensating for fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 concentration. Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international C-14 calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable C-14 offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the C-14 ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine C-14 data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data. We discuss the main differences with respect to the previous calibration curve, IntCal13, and some of the implications for archaeology and geosciences ranging from the recent past to the time of the extinction of the Neanderthals. | ['adolphi', 'austin', 'bard', 'bayliss', 'blackwell', 'buntgen', 'butzin', 'capano', 'cheng', 'edward', 'fahrni', 'fogtmann', 'schulz', 'friedrich', 'friedrich', 'grootes', 'guilderson', 'hajdas', 'heaton', 'hogg', 'hughen', 'kohler', 'kromer', 'kudsk', 'manning', 'miyake', 'muscheler', 'olsen', 'palmer', 'pearson', 'ramsey', 'reimer', 'reimer', 'reinig', 'richards', 'sakamoto', 'scott', 'sookdeo', 'southon', 'talamo', 'turney', 'wacker', 'van', 'der', 'plicht'] | ","['adolphi', 'austin', 'bard', 'bayliss', 'blackwell', 'buntgen', 'butzin', 'capano', 'cheng', 'edward', 'fahrni', 'fogtmann', 'schulz', 'friedrich', 'friedrich', 'grootes', 'guilderson', 'hajdas', 'heaton', 'hogg', 'hughen', 'kohler', 'kromer', 'kudsk', 'manning', 'miyake', 'muscheler', 'olsen', 'palmer', 'pearson', 'ramsey', 'reimer', 'reimer', 'reinig', 'richards', 'sakamoto', 'scott', 'sookdeo', 'southon', 'talamo', 'turney', 'wacker', 'van', 'der', 'plicht']",1
253,"Integrating archaeology and ancient DNA analysis to address invasive species colonization in the Gulf of Alaska | The intentional and unintentional movement of plants and animals by humans has transformed ecosystems and landscapes globally. Assessing when and how a species was introduced are central to managing these transformed landscapes, particularly in island environments. In the Gulf of Alaska, there is considerable interest in the history of mammal introductions and rehabilitating Gulf of Alaska island environments by eradicating mammals classified as invasive species. The Arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii) is of concern because it affects vegetation and seabirds on Gulf of Alaska islands. This animal is assumed to have been introduced by historic settlers; however, ground squirrel remains in the prehistoric archaeological record of Chirikof Island, Alaska, challenge this timeline and suggest they colonized the islands long ago. We used 3 lines of evidence to address this problem: direct radiocarbon dating of archaeological squirrel remains; evidence of prehistoric human use of squirrels; and ancient DNA analysis of dated squirrel remains. Chirikof squirrels dated to at least 2000 years ago, and cut marks on squirrel bones suggested prehistoric use by people. Ancient squirrels also shared a mitochondrial haplotype with modern Chirikof squirrels. These results suggest that squirrels have been on Chirikof longer than previously assumed and that the current population of squirrels is closely related to the ancient population. Thus, it appears ground squirrels are not a recent, human-mediated introduction and may have colonized the island via a natural dispersal event or an ancient human translocation. | ['dunning', 'ebbert', 'hofman', 'maldonado', 'martin', 'shirazi', 'west'] | ","['dunning', 'ebbert', 'hofman', 'maldonado', 'martin', 'shirazi', 'west']",4

Compilation of TEK spanning four decades involved analytical workshops, semidirective interviews, and collaborative fieldwork with local aboriginal informants and fishing guides. We found that TEK complemented EBK of brook charr by providing concordant and additional information about (1) population viability; (2) breeding areas and migration patterns of divergent populations; and (3) the behavioral ecology of populations within feeding areas; all of which may ultimately affect the maintenance of population diversity. Aboriginal concerns related to human pressures on this species, not revealed by EBK, also help to focus future conservation initiatives for divergent populations and to encourage restoration of traditional fishing practices. However, relative to EBK, the relevance of TEK to salmonid biodiversity conservation was evident mainly at a smaller spatial scale, for example, that of individual rivers occupied by populations or certain lake sectors. Nevertheless, EBK was only collected over a 4-yr period, so TEK provided an essential long-term temporal window to evaluate population differences and persistence. We concluded that, despite different conceptual underpinnings, spatially and temporally varying TEK and EBK both contribute to the knowledge base required to achieve sustainability and effective biodiversity conservation planning for a given species. Such integration may be particularly relevant in many isolated regions, where intraspecific diversity can go unrecognized due to sparse scientific knowledge or undocumented TEK, and where governmental agencies and local communities increasingly seek to find common ground on which to address biodiversity issues. | ['bernathez', 'coon', 'dion', 'fraser', 'prince'] | ","['bernathez', 'coon', 'dion', 'fraser', 'prince']",0
255,"Interpreting the meteorology of the late and post-glacial | In Baltic lands the Late Glacial ""Aller√∏d Oscillation"" of North European climate has been recognized through its effects for upwards of 50 years and later confirmed in Britain. Studies of glacier behaviour in association with climatic fluctuations supported the probability that evidence for contemporary Late Glacial climatic oscillations should be found in other continents. About 1950 it began to appear from pollen analysis supported by early radiocarbon dating that a similar episode occurred in eastern North America. Subsequently, more detailed studies in the longitude of the Upper Great Lakes have failed to support the occurrence of a climatic recession precisely contemporary with that in northwest Europe. Assemblage of dates with regard to the Late Glacial on a global scale is now possible and Dr. J. H. Mercer from Ohio University has recently argued that the climatic episode represented by the Aller√∏d oscillation is virtually confined in its effects to Europe. He offers an explanations based on the consequences of the probable behaviour of the Arctic ice. Recent developments in knowledge of the behaviour of the high-altitude wave pattern in the upper westerlies allow for a reconciliation of the controversial evidence with regard to the character and timing of apparent climatic anomalies in differing longitudes. The Aller√∏d oscillation should not be expected to be world-wide in its effects, or even in the Northern Hemisphere. Recent studies in northern Canada of the chronology of peat growth lend support to the view that a small but persistent change of the atmospheric circulation might cause the vegetation to register climatic effects differing considerably between, say, northern Manitoba and eastern Labrador. Further results from Siberia would be helpful. ¬© 1971. | ['manley'] | ",['manley'],1
256,"Introduction. For a history of aquatic animals of the northern seas | From May, 31st to June 3rd, 2017, an international conference was held at the Cerisy-la-Salle International Cultural Center, entitled ""Aquatic animals and Monsters of the Northern Seas (Imagination, knowledge, exploitation, from Antiquity to 1600)"", organized by the Centre Michel de Bouard - Craham (UMR 6273, Universite de Caen Normandie - CNRS). The introduction to the proceedings of this conference presents first the scientific context, and the research programs Dyrin (history of the Nordic fauna in the Middle Ages) and Ichtya (history of knowledge on fish from Antiquity to the Renaissance) in which the organizers of the conference are involved. A quick summary presents the state of art about studies on the history of northern animals, where the bibliography is still scarce, far from covering all possible topics, notably that of the European perception of the Scandinavian fauna. Then we summarize the state of knowledge on the history of ancient, medieval and renaissance ichtyological knowledge, with a specific focus on the habitat of marine species, the naming of fishes and marine mammals and their use in human nutrition. Finally, we present the various papers published in the volume, grouped under the topics developed during the conference (identification, naming and classification; animal products, fishing, trade and food; literature, representations, imagination and allegories). | ['buquet', 'gauvin', 'jacquemard', 'lucas', 'avenel'] | ","['buquet', 'gauvin', 'jacquemard', 'lucas', 'avenel']",1
257,"Inventory methods for finding historically cultivated hop (Humulus lupulus L.) in Sweden | The relationship between the conservation of plant genetic resources and their culture history is intimate. Consequently, biodiversity research must also take into account historical and cultural factors. An inventory of plants collected from all over Sweden was made with the aim of establishing a national Swedish gene bank for once cultivated hop. Only female hop, which could be regarded as cultivated hop on the basis of history, were selected. In this study, two different inventory methods were used: one based on plant habitat and the other involving the use of historical documents, primarily large-scale maps from the first half of the seventeenth century, used to locate their cultivars today. The documented history of the hop, combined with its biology, is the basis for the methods used. Hop is the only Swedish crop that according to a 1442 law had to be cultivated. The law lasted for over 400 years. Since the hop is a perennial, dioecious plant and only female individuals are cultivated, over time very few genetic recombination events are expected. Today, it is possible to connect and identify living plants using historical documents. The degree of connection between today's living plants and the historical evidence for hop cultivation differ between the two methods. | ['karsvall', 'strese', 'tollin'] | ","['karsvall', 'strese', 'tollin']",1

260,"Invited response to K. Ryan's comments on Coltrain et al. (2004) and Coltrain (2009): is Native Point ""Burial 21"" Dorset in age; were historic-era burials European in origin and how important were caribou in Sadlermiut diets? | This is an invited to response to K. Ryan's comments on Coltrain et al. (2004) and Coltrain (2009). Both publications present stable isotope data and AMS radiocarbon dates on a suite of eastern Arctic burials from three sites in north-western Hudson Bay. In these articles, we examined the importance of bow-head whaling among Thule foragers at Silimiut and Kamarvik and contrasted their subsistence strategies with those of the proto-historic Sadlermiut, using the stable and radio-isotope chemistry of purified bone collagen to monitor variability in resource acquisition over time. Ryan dismisses a Dorset-era radiocarbon date on a burial collected by Collins from the T-1 site asserting that a single radiocarbon measurement is not a reliable indicator of age and thus the burial is Sadlermiut not Dorset. She also contests our assessment that two historic-era individuals in the Sadlermiut mortuary assemblage were either European or consumed diets relatively high in European foods. Ryan further argues that our reconstruction of protohistoric Sadlermiut diets is not in keeping with the archaeofaunal record. Her primary concern is a perceived lack of agreement between a subset of our findings and the archaeological record. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. | ['coltrain'] | ",['coltrain'],4

263,"The Karyotype of the Eurasian Flying Squirrel Pteromys-Volans with a Consideration of Karyotypic and Other Distinctions in Glaucomys-Spp Rodentia Sciuridae | The karyotype of P. volans (L.) (2n = 38; FN [fundamental number] = 73) is described, based on material from Hokkaido [Japan] and northeastern Siberia [USSR], and compared with those of G. volans (L.) (2n = 48; FN = 80) and G. sabrinus (Shaw) (2n = 48; FN = 78) from North America. Although the similarities of the fundamental numbers are suggestive of karyotypic evolution of the Robertsonian type, the fossil record of these flying squirrels is at present fragmentary, and no conclusion is drawn as to their affinities. Definite differences were observed between the karyotypes of G. volans and G. sabrinus, which had been described as identical. In combination with karyotypic differences, other characteristics of the 2 North American species indicate both a divergence earlier and an age greater than were assumed from paleontologic evidence. Karyograms of the 3 spp. of flying squirrels are included. | ['rausch', 'rausch'] | ","['rausch', 'rausch']",4
264,"Karyotype Stability of the Root Vole Microtus-Oeconomus in the Central Part of Its Habitat and the History of the Formation of the Species Present Habitat | The karyotypes of M. oeconomus from the central part of its range (Novosibirsk's vicinities, Altai Mountain System, two regions of Yakutia, Magadan District) as well as those of voles from the Zaisan Depression referred earlier as M. limnophilus Buchner are described for the first time. Karyotype stability in all places studied (2n = 30) and belonging of the Zaisan voles to a M. oeconomus subspecies not described yet has been shown. The similarity between the Zaisan voles and M. limnophilus is a result of convergence. Either Robertsonian fusions or Robertsonian chromosome dissociations happened in M. oeconomus evolution: the first phenomenon took place when the karyotype transformed from 2n = 38, that is peculiar to the relative species, M. limnophilus, preserved the primitive karyotype; the second phenomenon resulted in the secondary formation of the populations with 2n = 32 (from an initial form with 2n = 30) in South Scandinavia. Evolutionary significance of the Robertsonian chromosome dissociations is discussed. The history of formation of the M. oeconomus present range is considered on the basis of comparison of paleontological, karyological and biogeographic data. | ['boeskorov', 'lyapunova', 'revin', 'yu', 'vorontsov'] | ","['boeskorov', 'lyapunova', 'revin', 'yu', 'vorontsov']",4
265,"Kelp-fed beef, swimming caribou, feral reindeer, and their hunters: Island mammals in a marine economy | Aleutian Islands and Alaska Peninsula residents have selectively introduced land mammals to their primarily marine based economy over the past two centuries. This paper describes these many introductions, contexts, and the longer term roles of these cattle, sheep, reindeer, and other land mammals in discrete island settings and the regional food economy based upon interviews in ten communities and comprehensive household surveys in eight of these. Caribou are indigenous and traditionally hunted in other parts of the state but are legally ""invasive"" in island contexts now managed by the federal government. Access to land and natural resources by Alaska Natives and rural peoples is regulated by state and federal agencies, but Aleutian residents have shaped their environment and engineered food sources to support their communities. This paper demonstrates that hardline approaches to removing invasive land mammal species will have human consequences and an integrated management policy emphasizing food security and conservation that includes reducing the density of these introduced species is most appropriate. ¬© 2016 by the authors. | ['reedy'] | ",['reedy'],4

269,"Land use pattern and its dynamic changes in Amur tiger distribution region | Land use and land cover change has been the primary cause for the habitat loss and fragmentation in the distribution region of Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica). Based on the spatiotemporal changes of land use and land cover in the distribution region, as well as their effects on the population dynamics of Amur tiger, this paper analyzed the development process and its characteristics of the main land use types (agricultural land, forest land, and construction land) in this region, with the land use change history being divided chronically into three distinctive periods, i.e. ancient times (prior to 1860) modem times (1860-1949) and contemporary times (after 1949). The results showed that the sporadic land use in ancient times had no significant effects on the survival of Amur tiger, while the extensive and intensive land use after the 1860s was mainly responsible for the decrease of Amur tiger population and its living space. Since 1949, the Amur tiger distribution region has been divided into two parts, i.e. Northeast China and Russia Far East. The differences in land use pattern, policy, and intensity between these two parts led to different survival status of Amur tiger. The key driving forces for the land use change in Amur tiger distribution region were human population increase, policy change, and increased productivity. | ['ge', 'kou', 'li', 'mu', 'tian', 'wang', 'wu'] | ","['ge', 'kou', 'li', 'mu', 'tian', 'wang', 'wu']",1
270,"Land and sea: Use of terrestrial mammal bones in coastal hunter-gatherer communities | On archaeological sites of coastal hunter-gatherers, marine taxa often far outnumber terrestrial mammals among the unmodified faunal remains. In such cases, terrestrial mammals are generally deemed unimportant in the overall economy because of their minor contribution to the diet. Such inferences overlook the fact that land mammals also provide numerous other materials including bone and antler, which may have played crucial roles in past economic lifeways. Several lines of evidence indicate the importance of terrestrial mammals as a source of raw materials for the manufacture of marine hunting and fishing equipment. These tools were used to support the main subsistence economies.

271,"Landscape and coast development of a lowland fjord margin following deglaciation, East Greenland | The landscapes of western Jameson Land bordering Hall Bredning fjord comprise upper river basins, glacial landscapes, lower river basins and a near-shore zone. The upper river basins are incised into bedrock and display no cover of young sediments whilst the glacial landscapes, located closer to the coast, are dominated by Pleistocene deposits and an irregular topography with hills and ridges. The lower river basins, dissecting the glacial landscapes,arc connected to the upper river basins and contain well-defined Holocene delta terraces. The near-shore zone, which includes the present coast, displays a few raised shorelines. Geomorphological observations combined with stratigraphic work and C-14 dates provide a chronological framework for the development of landscape and shoreline, as presented by a four-stage reconstruction. The first stage covers the deglaciation of western Jameson Land at the Weichselian-Holocene transition after a collapse of the main fjord glacier in Hall Bredning. The sea inundated the low-lying areas on Jameson Land forming small side-entry fjord basins that possibly follow the track of older valleys. This was followed by a second stage, the paraglacial period, when large meltwater production and sediment transport resulted in a fast infilling of the side-entry fjord basins by deltas. These are now exposed in terraces in the lower river basins at 70-80 m a.s.I. During a third stage the relaxation period, fluvial activity decreased and the land surface was increasingly occupied by a cover of tundra vegetation. A glacio-isostatic rebound resulted in a relative sea level fall and fluvial incision. During stages two and three the coast was exposed to shallow marine processes that aided the alignment of the coast. Stages one to three presumably lasted for less than 2000 years. During stage four, the stable period, lasting for several thousand years till the present, there were minor adjustments of shoreline and landscape. The four-step reconstruction describes the sedimentary response of a lowland fjord margin to dramatic changes in climate and sea level. The distribution of erosion and sedimentation during this development was mainly controlled by topography. The reconstruction of the latest environmental development of Jameson Land puts new light on Jameson Land's long and complex Quaternary stratigraphic record, The reconstruction may also be used as a model for the interpretation of deposits in similar areas elsewhere. | ['hansen'] | ",['hansen'],4

274,"Late Pleistocene remains of giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus Blumenbach) in Scandinavia: Chronology and environment | This article presents new data on the Late Pleistocene giant deer, Megaloceros giganteus (Blumenbach), describing its distribution in time and space, geographical and sexual variation and general biology. Twenty-three south Scandinavian fossils found in situ in lacustrine sediments or redeposited in glaciofluvial material form the basis of this investigation. Fourteen 14C dates show that the giant deer inhabited southern Scandinavia in the ice-free late Middle Weichselian from c. 40 000 to 28 000 BP (the Sandnes Interstadial) and again in the Late Weichselian from c. 12 000 to 10 700 BP (Older Dryas, Allerod and early Younger Dryas Chronozones), corresponding to a calibrated range from c. 14 300 to 12 400 cal. yr BP. Osteometric analyses show that the Scandinavian giant deer belonged to the upper size range of the lateglacial Irish population and that a marked sexual dimorphism existed, the males being 10-11% larger than the females. Investigations furthermore point at an antler cycle similar to that among extant northern cervids, and subsequently at a rutting season in autumn. The skeletal remains also prove the occurrence of twin delivery and the possibility of reaching an ontogenetic age of at least 23 years. During both occurrences the Scandinavian giant deer population was part of the northernmost distribution of the species in Europe and the palaeogeographical settings and palaeoenvironmental conditions of the two periods show striking similarities. Clearly, the giant deer were able to colonize and survive in a landscape dominated by grasses and sedges with scattered shrubs and dwarf shrubs. They came as close as 200-250 km to the ice front and their distribution included coastal areas along a cold sea with drifting icebergs. They were present in the area at least from March until November. However, the pure arctic conditions created during the early phase of the Younger Dryas event led to a new local extinction around 10 700 14C yr BP. This was the beginning of a total Eurasian extinction which, at least in Europe, was completed before the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. | ['aaris', 'sorensen', 'liljegren'] | ","['aaris', 'sorensen', 'liljegren']",4
275,"Late-Quaternary biogeographic scenarios for the brown bear (Ursus arctos), a wild mammal model species | This review provides an up-to-date synthesis of the matrilineal phylogeography of a uniquely well-studied Holarctic mammal, the brown bear. We extend current knowledge by presenting a DNA sequence derived from one of the earliest known fossils of a polar bear (dated to 115 000 years before present), a species that shares a paraphyletic mitochondrial association with brown bears. A molecular clock analysis of 140 mitochondrial DNA sequences, including our new polar bear sequence, provides novel insights into the times of origin for different brown bear clades. We propose a number of regional biogeographic scenarios based on genetic data, divergence time estimates and paleontological records. The case of the brown bear provides an example for researchers working with less well-studied taxa: it shows clearly that phylogeographic models based on patterns of modern genetic variation alone can be substantially improved by including data on historical patterns of genetic diversity in the form of ancient DNA sequences derived from accurately dated samples and by using an approach to divergence-time estimation that suits the data under analysis. Using such approaches it has been possible to (i) establish that the processes shaping modern genetic diversity in brown bears acted recently, within the last three glacial cycles; (ii) distinguish among hypotheses concerning species' responses to climatic oscillations in accordance with the lack of phylogeographic structure that existed in brown bears prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM); (iii) reassess theories linking monophyletic brown bear populations to particular LGM refuge areas; and (iv) identify vicariance events and track analogous patterns of migration by brown bears out of Eurasia to North America and Japan.

276,"Late Quaternary dune formations (D‚ÄôOlkuminskaya series) in central Yakutia (Part 2) | The generalized geologic section of the Kysyl-Syr dune massif (tukulan) in the lower Vilyuy river basin (Central Yakutia) on the basis of new 14 C dates from 27 samples and biostratigraphic data allowed new insights about the Late Quaternary evolution of paleogeographic conditions of dune-forming processes in the region. Based on the previously published results of the studies of key-sections of dune sediments in different parts of Central Yakutia and new absolute age dates, the authors have concluded that the widespread in Central Yakutia dune sediments (D‚Äôolkuminskaya series) formed at different hypsometric levels (river terraces, watersheds) over a time spanning from the latest Karginsky termochrone (late MIS-3) till the beginning of the Holocene (between 35 and 10 kyr) under conditions of severe desiccation and desertification of the area. The dune stabilization by soil-vegetation cover occurred during the Boreal optimum of the Holocene (12‚Äì6 kyr). The modern dune massifs are interpreted to have formed no more than 1 thousand years ago, which is associated with climatic events of the Little Ice Age. ¬© 2018 Academic Publishing House Geo.

277,"Late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions on the continents: a short review | This paper provides an overview of the contentious issue of global megafaunal extinctions in the Late Quaternary. The main proposed causes are overkill', environmental change or a combination of both. There are major objections to the other suggested causes. Extinctions were highly variable in their severity between different zoogeographical regions, with the greatest impact in North America, South America and Australia, but also substantial in northern Eurasia. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia were much less affected. For northern Eurasia, detailed chronologies show a staggered extinction pattern, in which each megafaunal species exhibits unique and complex distributional shifts, culminating in extinction for some species and survival in others. Environmental drivers were clearly very important, although the possible role of humans is not yet clear. Alaska/Yukon also has a good radiocarbon record which also suggests a staggered extinction pattern. However, the available data for the rest of North America are largely unsatisfactory. South America also boasted spectacular extinct megafauna, but again the currently available dates are insufficient to reliably discern patterns or possible causes. Australia and New Guinea also suffered major losses, but extinctions probably occurred much earlier than elsewhere, so that establishing a chronology is especially difficult. Africa and Southern Asia have the least available data. In order to make meaningful progress, it is vital to establish a large database of reliable radiocarbon dates for each region made directly on securely identified megafaunal remains. The need is for much more high quality data, not more debate based on imperfect evidence. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | ['stuart'] | ",['stuart'],4
278,"Late Quaternary Vegetation of the Aleutian Islands Southwestern Alaska USA | Late Quaternary vegetational history of the Aleutian Islands is interpreted from fossil pollen and spore stratigraphy and radiocarbon chronology of sections of mires on the islands of Attu, Adak, Atka, and Umnak. Mires postdate the withdrawal of ice-age glaciers between approximately 12000 and 10000 years ago with the exception of the mire on Attu Island, where deglaciation apparently began as late as 7000 years ago. No uniform pattern of change in Pacific coastal tundra communities is evident in the fossil assemblages. Pollen assemblages, consisting variably of Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Empetrum, Umbelliferae, Salix, Ranunculaceae, Compositae, Polypodiaceae, and Lycopodium, reflect conditions in effect in different sectors of the Aleutian chain. Climate, soil, topography, volcanism, and sesmic activity are noteworthy parameters influencing vegetation composition and distribution. Volcanism has been of major importance, as shown by thickness, distribution, and frequency of tephra layers that number 5 on Attu, 24 on Adak, 17 on Atka, and 5 on Umnak. A repeated condition of patch dynamics, created in the main by recurrent volcanic eruptions with widespread accompanying ashfalls, has apparently overprinted the effects of climatic change. | ['heusser'] | ",['heusser'],1
279,"Late Weichselian to early Holocene sedimentation in a steep fjord/valley setting, Visdalen, Edgeoya, eastern Svalbard: Glacial deposits, alluvial/colluvial-fan deltas and spit-platforms | The Visdalen valley, situated at the northwestern corner of Edgeoya, was investigated with respect to lithostratigraphy and depositional environments of the Quaternary sediments. Eight major lithostratigraphic units are recognised of which seven were deposited during the Late Weichselian to early Holocene glaciation, deglaciation and the subsequent emergence of the area, and one unit deposited prior the last glaciation. Till deposition from a west-flowing glacier was followed by glaciomarine and later marine deposition of fine-grained sediments. Coarse-grained colluvial and alluvial-fan deltas were deposited along the mountainsides in the Visdalen palaeo-bay, and distal sediment gravity-flow deposits from these deltas were interbedded with the glaciomarine-marine sediments. A spit-platform (riegel) was built up across the Visdalen bay contemporaneously with the alluvial fan-deltas. Its formation was time-transgressive, with its highest part in the south close to the marine limit at 85 m a.s.l. and its lowest part in the north at ea 65 m a.s.l. The sediment source was alluvial and colluvial debris, which was entrained by longshore currents along the more exposed coast south of Visdalen and transported northwards to the final place of deposition. The bulk part of the riegel ridge is composed of progradational successions of steep forests dipping towards NW, N and NE, and clearly rejects an earlier ice-contact model. Datings suggest that the fan-delta deposition and the riegel formation ended before 9,000 BP. A meltwater-fed lagoon with a highest level at gt 50 m a.s.l. was formed behind the riegel ridge in which, according to varve counting, glaciolacustrine sedimentation lasted more than 250 years and occurred within the time span 9,000-8,500 BP. Gradual uplift of the area resulted in drainage of the glaciolacustrine lagoon. Beachface processes and fluvial down-cutting took place during the emergence of the area. | ['kronborg', 'moller', 'stubdrup'] | ","['kronborg', 'moller', 'stubdrup']",4
280,"Late Weichselian Flora and Vegetation of Andoya Northern Norway Macrofossil Seed and Fruit Evidence from Nedre Aerasvatn | A Late Weichselian sediment column from Nedre/Erasvatn, Andoya, Northern Norway, spanning c. 20 000 to 11 000 B.P., has been analyzed with respect to phanerogam macrofossils. Seeds are rare in the lower, marine part of the sequence (19 500 to 15 500 B.P.). They occur more frequently in the post-15 500 B.P. lacustrine sediments. Maximum seed numbers are associated with the 16 000 to 15 000 B.P. and 12 800 B.P. (Bolling) ameliorations. Puccinellia and Papaver radicatum s.1. are the two main seed types. Their distribution and numbers agree with the Poaceae and Papaver pollen curves. Two main vegetation types are suggested to be dominant during during most of the Late Weichselian: Plains and depressions with prominent Puccinellia, and polar deserts with Papaver, both in a dry environment. Both vegetation types decreased in the more humid climate of the Older Dryas and Allerod chronozones (12 000 to 11 000 B.P.). Some hardy plant species e.g. Papaver radicatum s.1., may have survived the entire Weichselian glaciation on Andoya. For most other phanerogams, a history of immigration and subsequent in situ survival, migration or disappearance is suggested. | ['alm', 'birks'] | ","['alm', 'birks']",4
281,"Latitudinal variation in a photoperiod response gene in European barley: insight into the dynamics of agricultural spread from 'historic' specimens | Between ca. 6000 BC and ca. 500 BC, barley cultivation spread across the continent of Europe from the extreme south to the extreme north. Carbon-dating would suggest that this spread, and indeed the spread of crop cultivation generally, varied in its pace, with 'delays' at certain points along its route. Such delays in the spread of agriculture have been explained as resulting from the slow assimilation of agricultural practices by existing indigenous human populations or as the time taken for the crops to adapt to novel climatic conditions, such as altered temperature regimes and day-lengths. A mutant form of the photoperiod response gene, Ppd-H1, causes barley to be non-responsive to long days, while the wild-type responsive form allows plants to flower in response to long days. We sequenced this gene in 65 'historic' barley accessions, from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in order to explore the potential role of environmental adaptation in the spread of agriculture. We chose to use 'historic' material, to complement the richer patterns in extant genetic lines, by spreading the data range in both time and space. Our 'historic' barley data shows a latitudinal divide in the Ppd-H1 gene similar to that found in extant lines, but with clearer geographical resolution, and extending northwards into the Arctic Circle. We discuss the implications of our results in relation to the dynamics of agricultural spread across Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

285,"Lichenometric dating: Science or pseudo-science? | The popular technique of estimating ages of deposits from sizes of lichens continues despite valid criticism, and without agreement on range of utility, treatment of error, and methods of measurement, sampling, and data handling. A major source of error is the assumption that the largest lichen(s) colonized soon after deposition and will survive indefinitely. Recent studies on lichen mortality suggest that this assumption is untenable. Meanwhile, the use of ""growth curves"" constructed from independently dated substrates is problematic for many reasons, but this has not prevented the publication of baseless claims of accuracy and ages that are extrapolated well beyond data. Experiments indicate that numeric lichenometric ages are not reliable, and in general do not advance the cause of Quaternary science. There are a few studies suggesting reliability, and indeed there may be cases where lichens and growth curves actually provide realistic numerical ages. But it cannot be foretold which lichen assemblages will provide good ages and which bad ages. The logical conclusion is that no assumption of good ages can be made, and that it is folly to assign numerical ages to a deposit on the basis of lichen sizes. (C) 2014 University of Washington.

286,"Lichenometric analysis of the Karkerieppe slush-avalanche fan, Karkevagge, Sweden | Sizes of isolated and fully exposed largest lichens on 950 blocks of schistose rock record the times and extents of slush avalanches derived from a stream channel and cirque upstream from the 300 m long Karkerieppe fan in Karkevagge, northern Sweden. Small slush avalanches are so frequent that few blocks older than 50 years remain on the fanhead. At least 13 smaller and larger slush avalanches occurred between 1950 and 1995; a production rate of about 30 per century. At least 24 slush avalanches extended to the mid-fan area between about 1790 and 1950; a mean production rate of large slush avalanches of about 15 per century. ''Little Ice Age'' advances of the Karkerieppe cirque glacier ended at about 1870 and may have supplied blocks to slush avalanches. Subsequent glacier retreat has changed the source-area hydrologic and topographic characteristics affecting generation of slush avalanches, and has exposed new bed-rock sources of blocks for slush avalanches. | ['brogaard', 'bull', 'schlyter'] | ","['brogaard', 'bull', 'schlyter']",2

However, despite the large number of published fossil based-studies, specific databases on the vulnerability of species in the past are not available. We compiled a worldwide database of published fossil records of plant range losses over the last 30 ka across all continents. Widespread range losses of plant taxa across all latitudes were identified, with the majority representing gymnosperms. Focusing on conifers, a group of plants with well understood distribution and conservation status, we found that past range losses often overlapped areas where species are endangered at present, suggesting that such areas have been prone to biodiversity loss through time. During phases of past rapid climate change, even areas that currently have low levels of endangered species were affected by plant range losses, in some cases with disappearance of taxa from entire continents, islands or major geographic regions. Integration of modern and palaeoecological data enhance our understanding of the complex processes underlying the modes, rates, and extent of threats to plants under changing climate and increasing human pressure, which is vital information for effective conservation actions.

290,"Macro Fossil Analysis of Wood Rat Neotoma Middens as a Key to the Quaternary Vegetational History of Arid America | Wood rat (Neotoma) deposits preserved in dry rock shelters have radiocarbon ages extending from close to the present to > 40,000 B.P., providing elaborate samples of changing vegetation during the climatic shifts of the late Pleistocene and Holocene. The established record extends geographically from Oregon and Wymoning (at 45.degree. N) [USA] south to Baja California, Sonora and to Tehuacan (at 18.degree. N) in S Mexico. Several hundred ancient middens were uncovered, and over 130 were radiocarbon-dated. There are about 20 extant species of Neotoma with a combined range extending from the Yukon [Canada] and New England to Nicaragua and Florida. A wider application for the method seems likely, wherever dry caves favor preservation. The acquisitive rats accumulate an incredibly detailed inventory of the local flora and fauna within a small home range, measured at about 100 m or less in radius. The biomass spectrum of a modern wood rat deposit was compared with associated pollen spectra and source vegetation. The most dominant arborescent species, as determined by a quantitative study of the local vegetation, were proportionately represented in the midden, but not in the pollen rain. Less dominant species were variable in proportionality. A novel approach to the comparative ecological physiology of long-dead plants was demonstrated with macrofossils from ancient wood rat deposits. The ratio of the stable isotopes of carbon (13C/12C) is more altered from the atmospheric proportion during CO2 fixation by C3 plants than it is by the different (phospho-enol-pyruvate) carboxylating enzyme of heliophile or xerophytic, C4 or plants with crassulacean acid metabolism. Mass spectrometry of the carbon of macrofossils enables the distinction to be made in the past. The desiccated, allelochemic urine or amberat, indurates and preserves the middens by cementing the loose debris of macrofossils into a tough, coherent mass of surprising strength and rigidity, that adheres tenaciously to rock surfaces. Water softens the most indurated middens by dissolving the crystallized urine, causing them to dislodge and to fall apart; it also removes the osmotic and allelochemic deterrent to decay by fungi, or to consumption by termites, crickets, or other decomposing herbivores. A secure position in a dry rock shelter is therefore essential to preservation of the macrofossils for time periods on the order of 104 years. Attrition with time is seen in the frequency distribution of radiocarbon dates obtained on 132 Neotoma middens. The distribution is skewed toward the end of the Wisconsin glacial and the Holocene, and there is a decline in frequency with age. Cave erosion, including destructive rockfalls and new crevices that admit seepage and cause deterioration and dislodgement of the middens, is probably the main factor in the progressive attrition with increasing age. | ['well'] | ",['well'],4

In regard to mobile art, or portable art (carvings or sculptures made on organic and inorganic materials), research aimed at identifying local differences between Upper Paleolithic cultural groups, and tracking their prehistoric geographic ranges across Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene, is considered to be especially relevant. Here we present the results of a study of the Late Paleolithic assemblage of Ust-Kova, focusing on the different technologies involved in the production of mobile paleo-art in Siberia. The results indicate that a complex array of technological methods were used to manufacture personal ornaments and sculptures out of ivory. Furthermore, it reveals some of the technical connections between the paleoart objects and the stone tools used to manufacture them. Overall, the study presented here improves our understanding of the genesis and evolution of ancient technologies related to paleoart manufacture in Northern Eurasia. | ['drozdov', 'gubar', 'lbova', 'volkov'] | ","['drozdov', 'gubar', 'lbova', 'volkov']",4

During the next 100 years reindeer numbers and distribution increased and declined precipitously on the Seward Peninsula; wildlife species repopulated this region through natural processes or translocations by man; the non-Native human population of Alaska increased dramatically and wildlife management became an issue of national concern creating diverse public desires regarding resource use; and both range and wildlife became intensively managed through complex, politicized processes. This paper provides an hi storical overview of reindeer and wildlife abundance on the Seward Peninsula during the 20th century and describes the effects of wildlife on the reindeer industry. Cooperative public processes have been initiated to bring diverse public interests together; meld indigenous, scientific and local knowledge of resources; and supplement governmental wildlife management programmes. Even so, the Seward Peninsula reindeer industry has been severely impacted by wildlife, especially caribou (R. t. granti). | ['dau'] | ",['dau'],4

297,"Does the 'Marine Signature' of Driftwood Persist in the Archaeological Record? An Experimental Case Study from Iceland | The limited native tree flora of Iceland, combined with the decline in native woodlands following the settlement of the island in the late ninth century AD, led to a very limited availability of timber on the island. However, Icelanders continued to rely on wood for fuel, construction and artefact production. Driftwood, which arrives in great quantities on the shores of Iceland, became an extremely important resource, especially for construction. Driftwood has been identified in archaeological wood assemblages in Iceland through taxonomic categorisation of wood remains as deriving from native, drifted or imported wood. However, many of the species found as driftwood have wide geographical ranges, or are anatomically indistinguishable from taxa which may have been imported to Iceland. Furthermore, the use of modern studies of driftwood as comparisons is problematic due to the influence of changing forest composition, oceanic circulation and logging practices. Driftwood has a marine chemical signature due to its immersion in seawater. This paper uses electrical conductivity testing of 'fresh', drifted and archaeological wood to assess the extent to which this marine signature is likely to persist in the archaeological record, and whether this could be used to conclusively identify driftwood in archaeological assemblages. | ['mooney'] | ",['mooney'],1

Currently, the most important dating techniques are dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating. Our approach is based on molecular decay over time under specific preservation conditions. In the models presented here, construction wood, cold soft waterlogged wood and wood from living trees are combined. Under these conditions, molecular decay as a usable clock for dating purposes takes place with comparable speed. Preservation conditions apart from those presented here are not covered by the model and cannot currently be dated with this method. For example, samples preserved in a clay matrix seem not to fit into the model. Other restrictions are discussed in the paper. One model presented covers 7,500 years with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 682 years for a single measurement. Another model reduced to the time period of the last 800 years results in a RMSE of 92 years. As multiple measurements can be performed on a single object, the total error for the whole object will be even lower. | ['grabner', 'helama', 'kirchhefer', 'krapiec', 'nievergelt', 'reinig', 'smidt', 'spangl', 'timonen', 'tintner'] | ","['grabner', 'helama', 'kirchhefer', 'krapiec', 'nievergelt', 'reinig', 'smidt', 'spangl', 'timonen', 'tintner']",4

301,"Mesolithic | The Mesolithic period in northwestern Europe was characterised by a significant transformation of human endeavour. Marginalised by colder conditions for tens of millennia, hunter-gatherer populations manipulated increased resource opportunities stimulated by a warming climate, at a time of dramatic sea-level rise. Their selective subsistence methods and semi-sedentary settlement patterns might, in theory, have primed them to more easily adopt the agricultural and animal husbandry practices that followed, however, they hardly ran for the exit from their tenacious way of life and adapted to the inevitable only slowly in places. Current palaeogenetic research shows some indigenous hunter-gatherers lived in close proximity to immigrant farmers for many generations (Bollongino et al. 2013). This huge timespan of over 5000 years, half of the Holocene, is therefore of vital importance to our understanding of how and why human behaviour and belief systems began to change irretrievably, and to so comprehensively dominate the natural world. ¬© Archaeopress and the individual authors 2016. | ['jones'] | ",['jones'],4
302,"Mesolithic settlement in northernmost Sweden: Economy, technology, chronology | In this paper the chronology of early Stone Age sites in Norrbotten (the northernmost part of Sweden) is studied, with the purpose of understanding human and faunal migration into Norrbotten and adaptation to the new environment during the Mesolithic after the latest glaciation. The results from radiocarbon dates acquired of burnt bones from both old and new data from selected sites in Norrbotten, and a reanalysis of the lithic material for the purpose of identifying the technological traditions, form a foundation for further studies about faunal history and economy on archaeological sites in northern Sweden. The results also connect the introduction of flora and fauna into the newly ice-free area in Sweden with the movement of animals and people in Finland. Especially the late introduction of hunting seals in northern Sweden strengthens the argument for connections to Finland rather than to southern Sweden. ¬© 2016 Suomen Arkeologinen Seura.

303,"The methods by which the evolution of domesticated animals may be controlled | THE author attempts to give a brief survey of the evolution of animals under domestication according to Darwin, stressing at the same time the importance of the evolutionary problem for the socialised economy of the U.S.S.R. interpreted in the light of Marx-Lenin teaching. This paper serves as an introduction to Vol. I of "" The problems of the origin, evolution and breed formation of domestic animals, "" of which 2 more volumes are to be published later. Numerous teams of experts have been entrusted in the U.S.S.R. with the task of integrating contemporary knowledge on the subject. In the field of history and palaeontology a new subject, named by the author palaeoctenology, has been developed; it deals with the laws governing the development of animal husbandry in the classless and class stages of the evolution of human society. The social, biological, and geographical implications, in relation to modern times, of the ancient local and widespread civilizations are studied in detail. Capital treatises have been published on: (1) the history of the genus Ovis from antiquity to our days; (2) Canidae of the Old and New World; (3) the history of cattle in general, and new elements of classification into which a new type, Bos turanomongolicus, was introduced; (4) the history, origin, and evolution of the horse, based mainly on the study of equine populations of the U.S.S.R. and Mongolia; and (5) camels and Camelidae. The problems of ecology and physiology in relation to the formation of fine-wool sheep and dairy cattle breeds have been exhaustively dealt with in the works of Kaskarov (1934, 1937) and Brauner (Manuscript). A world map of the centres of origin of domesticated animals has been prepared by N. I. Vavilov (1934). A number of interesting parallel variations (hairless sheep, goats, calves, curly-haired horses, colour aberrations, etc.) have been recorded, and a book by Schmalhausen (1938), "" The organism as a whole in its individual and historical development, '' throws new light on the problem of mutation. In the realm of heredity important contributions have been made by Severcov, through his studies of evolutionary morphology, and a number of scientists who have extended to animal husbandry the concepts of phasic development formulated by Lysenko in the case of plants and of environmental factors in heredity advanced by Hammond. In the concluding part the author attempts to give a prognosis as to the path of development likely to be followed in the U.S.S.R. He assumes that the work will be concentrated-in view of the rapid reconstruction of animal industry now taking place-on the production of new breeds suitable for varied environments in different regions of the country. | ['bogoljubskii'] | ",['bogoljubskii'],4
304,"Methodological Aspects of Determining Type, Age, and Origin of Archaeological Wood: The Case of Fort Nadym | Archaeological studies in the forest-tundra zone of Western Siberia are highly relevant to studying the material culture, social structure, and ethnic history. The presence ofpermafrost ensures the unique preservation of organics in cultural layers, including timber, which makes it possible to conduct dendrochronological studies (calendar dating of samples, determination of species composition, typological analysis, and the source of the timber origin). In 2011-2012, during the excavations at Fort Nadym, 347 samples of wood were selected for the assessment of the age of wooden structures. The results showed that most samples belonged to three species of trees: Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.), Siberian spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.), and Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour). The typological analysis revealed that walls were mostly built from spruce, pine logs, and half-logs, whereas the floors were made from larch and pine. To assess the origin of wood, a new methodological approach was proposed. As a result, it was demonstrated that the main building material was driftwood. This has allowed us to make more accurate interpretations and to specify the years of construction. The analysis indicates three periods of construction / reconstruction: the 1450s-1460s, 1470s-1480s, and 1520s-1570s. The new approach can be applied to other wooden monuments located on the banks of major water arteries of the Siberian forest-tundra zone. –ê—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤ –ª–µ—Å–æ—Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –∑–æ–Ω–µ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏ –∏–º–µ—é—Ç –æ–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–ª—è –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã, —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä—ã –∏ —ç—Ç–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ù–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–µ –≤–µ—á–Ω–æ–π –º–µ—Ä–∑–ª–æ—Ç—ã –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç —É–Ω–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—É—é —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–ª–æ—è—Ö –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∏, –≤ —Ç.—á. –∏ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã, —á—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ-—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π (–≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–π –¥–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–æ–≤, –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞, –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–∏–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –∏ –≤—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã). –í 2011-2012 –≥–≥. –≤ —Ö–æ–¥–µ —Ä–∞—Å–∫–æ–ø–æ–∫ –ù–∞–¥—ã–º—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∫–∞ –±—ã–ª–æ –æ—Ç–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–æ 347 –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–æ–≤ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã –¥–ª—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Å–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π. –†–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∏, —á—Ç–æ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è –∏—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ —Ç—Ä–µ–º –≤–∏–¥–∞–º –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤: –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü–µ —Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π (Larix sibirica Ledeb.), –µ–ª–∏ —Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π (Picea obovata Ledeb.) –∏ —Å–æ—Å–Ω–µ —Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π (Pinus sibirica Du Tour). –¢–∏–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–æ–≤ –≤—ã—è–≤–∏–ª –ø—Ä–µ–∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –¥–ª—è —Å–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å—Ç–µ–Ω –µ–ª–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∏ –∫–µ–¥—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –±—Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω, –ø–æ–ª—É–±—Ä–µ–≤–µ–Ω, –∞ –¥–ª—è –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∏–ª–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∞ -–ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –∫–µ–¥—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –ø–ª–∞—Ö. –î–ª—è —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∞ –æ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–∏–Ω—ã –±—ã–ª –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥, –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º—É —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π –µ–µ –æ–±—ä–µ–º —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª—Å—è –∏–∑ –ø–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞. –≠—Ç–æ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏–ª–æ –∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏ —É—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏—Ç—å –≥–æ–¥—ã –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç. –ü–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–º –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Ç—Ä–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞/–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∏: 50-60-–µ –≥–≥.

305,"Middle-Upper Quaternary stratigraphy in the northeast of European Russia inferred from rodent record and lithology of tills | We present the revision of materials on Quaternary rodent biostratigraphy (collared lemming Dicrostonyx and narrow-headed vole Lasiopodomys gregalis) in the northeast of European Russia testing the biostratigraphic method with lithological and palynological data. Petrographic composition of clastic material and orientation of clasts in fills are regionally stable lithostratigraphic criteria. Pechora (Dnieper) moraine is characteristic for clast axes oriented in the sector 340-60 degrees; clasts in Vychegda (Moscow) fill show orientation of 270-360 degrees, which, in combination with the petrographic composition of erratic material, indicates the origin of moraines from different source glacial provinces. Certain differences were also found in the associations of heavy minerals. A specific trait of the Upper Neopleistocene Polar fill is the presence of erratic crinoid-bryozoan limestones from Novaya Zemlya. Connection of this fill with the Pay-Khoy-Novaya-Zemlya ice center and, possibly, with the shelves of the Barents and Kara Seas is also confirmed by the orientation of clasts from north-northeast to south-southwest. Middle Neopleistocene rodent remains are found between the Pechora and Vychegda moraines. By the ratio of M1 and M2 morphotypes all Middle Neopliestocene assemblages are divided into three groups representing morphs: D. simplicior morph 2 (Gavrilovka, Bolshaya Sluda, Akis', Laya-4), D. simplicior morph 3 (Sercheyu-1, Laya-3) and D. ex gr. simplicior-gulielmi (Shapkina-4, Chuley, the lower horizon of Kipievo). These evolutionary levels respectively correspond to late Pechora (Dnieper, MIS 8), Rodionovo (Shklov, MIS 7) and early Vychegda (Moscow, MIS 6) intervals. Biochronological criteria for Late Quaternary based on evolutionary level of teeth of collared lemming and narrow-headed vole are suggested. It has been revealed that the early Valdai (MIS 5d-a-4) is characterized by the morph 2 D. gulielmi, as well as the high (about 50%) proportion of the gregaloid morphotype among the first lower molars of L. gregalis. Lemmings of morphs 2 and 3 D. gulielmi lived during the Middle Valdai (MIS 3), and animal of morphs 3 D. gulielmi and D. ex gr. gulielmitorquatus existed during the Last Glacial Maximum. Lemmings at the levels of D. gulielmi morph 3, D. ex gr. gulielmi-torquatus, D. torquatus morphs 1 and 2 were typical for Lateglacial; morphs 1 and 2 D. torquatus - for the early Holocene; morph 3 D. torquatus - for the late Holocene and recent times. Small (less than 25%) proportion of the gegaloid morphotype is characteristic of ml of Middle and Late Valdai and modern narrow-headed voles. | ['andreicheva', 'ponomarev'] | ","['andreicheva', 'ponomarev']",4

307,"Modern research with bryophytes: An overview | The idea that bryophytes from a truly ancient lineage of plants rests upon inadequate fossil evidence of their presumed lower Paleozoic origins from Charalean-like or Coleochaetalean-like algae. In this regard a special challenge is the unequivocal interpretation of the biphasic life cycle of bryophyte-like plant fossils. Unique among land plants in having a dominant gametophyte phase, bryophytes present opportunities for a broad array of research not readily undertaken in sporophyte-dominated organisms. This is enhanced by the ease with which bryophytes in culture can be manipulated experimentally and Subjected to analytical testing. Such attributes have permitted numerous recent advances in what is known about the cell biology and physiology of this group of plants. Progress is also evident in deciphering the natural products chemistry of bryophytes. Of far reaching importance are recent advancements in understanding speciation and genetic diversity within species. Where bryophytes are vegetation dominants (e.g., polar, arctic, and boreal regions, and low latitude-high elevation forests), the importance of research involving these organisms with increase in proportion to environmental pressures created by the expanding human population and its agricultural and industrial base. | ['miller'] | ",['miller'],4
308,"Modern Siberian dog ancestry was shaped by several thousand years of Eurasian-wide trade and human dispersal | Dogs have been essential to life in the Siberian Arctic for over 9,500 y, and this tight link between people and dogs continues in Siberian communities. Although Arctic Siberian groups such as the Nenets received limited gene flow from neighboring groups, archaeological evidence suggests that metallurgy and new subsistence strategies emerged in Northwest Siberia around 2,000 y ago. It is unclear if the Siberian Arctic dog population was as continuous as the people of the region or if instead admixture occurred, possibly in relation to the influx of material culture from other parts of Eurasia. To address this question, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 20 ancient and historical Siberian and Eurasian Steppe dogs. Our analyses indicate that while Siberian dogs were genetically homogenous between 9,500 to 7,000 y ago, later introduction of dogs from the Eurasian Steppe and Europe led to substantial admixture. This is clearly the case in the Iamal-Nenets region (Northwestern Siberia) where dogs from the Iron Age period (-2,000 y ago) possess substantially less ancestry related to European and Steppe dogs than dogs from the medieval period (-1,000 y ago). Combined with findings of nonlocal materials recovered from these archaeological sites, including glass beads and metal items, these results indicate that Northwest Siberian communities were connected to a larger trade network through which they acquired genetically distinctive dogs from other regions. These exchanges were part of a series of major societal changes, including the rise of large-scale reindeer pastoralism-800 y ago. | ['antipina', 'appelt', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'bachura', 'beglane', 'bradley', 'carmagnini', 'dalen', 'daly', 'feuerborn', 'frantz', 'gilbert', 'gopalakrishnan', 'gregersen', 'guo', 'gusev', 'hansen', 'jones', 'kosintsev', 'kuzmin', 'larson', 'losey', 'mattiangeli', 'meldgaard', 'nomokonova', 'perri', 'plekhanov', 'ramos', 'madrigal', 'schmidt', 'shaymuratova', 'sinding', 'smith', 'willerslev', 'yavorskaya', 'zhang'] | ","['antipina', 'appelt', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'bachura', 'beglane', 'bradley', 'carmagnini', 'dalen', 'daly', 'feuerborn', 'frantz', 'gilbert', 'gopalakrishnan', 'gregersen', 'guo', 'gusev', 'hansen', 'jones', 'kosintsev', 'kuzmin', 'larson', 'losey', 'mattiangeli', 'meldgaard', 'nomokonova', 'perri', 'plekhanov', 'ramos', 'madrigal', 'schmidt', 'shaymuratova', 'sinding', 'smith', 'willerslev', 'yavorskaya', 'zhang']",4
309,"The modus operandi of walrus exploitation during the Palaeoeskimo period at the Tayara site, Arctic Canada | Thanks to its high nutritional potential and huge ivory canines, walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) appears to have been a key resource in the subsistence economy of Dorset groups. However present archaeological data are sparse and a more global analysis of its exploitation by the Palaeoeskimos is required. The Tayara site (KbFk-7) in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada) yielded a significant assemblage of walrus bones and many manufactured ivory objects. In addition, Tayara serves as a reference site in Eastern Arctic cultural chronology. A thorough zooarchaeological study has been conducted which includes skeletal profile, the sexing and ageing of walrus bones, and a technological study of the manufactured objects, including a use-wear analysis on lithic tools. This allows the discussion of several aspects of the modus operandi for the exploitation of walrus, from the death of the animal to the processing of the raw material into artefacts. Even if the walrus seems to have been treated with the same processes as other species, some specificities have been noted, particularly in the selection of the different skeletal elements for tool productions and the emblematic value that this animal may have played in consumption and production activities. | ['desrosiers', 'dionne', 'gendron', 'houmard', 'monchot'] | ","['desrosiers', 'dionne', 'gendron', 'houmard', 'monchot']",4
310,"Molecular paleontology | Molecular paleontology, i.e., the recovery of DNA from ancient human, animal, and plant remains is an innovative research field that has received progressively more attention from the scientific community since the 1980s. In the last decade, the field was punctuated by claims which aroused great interest but eventually turned out to be fakes - the most famous being the sequence of dinosaur DNA later shown to be of human origin. At present, the discipline is characterized by some certainties and many doubts. We know, for example, that we have reasonable chances to recover authentic DNA from a mammoth carcass, while our chances are negligible (or nonexistent) in the case of a dynastic mummy from Egypt. On the other hand, though we are developing convincing models of DNA decay in bone, we are not yet able to predict whether a certain paleontological or archeological site will yield material amenable to DNA analysis. This article reviews some of the most important and promising investigations using molecular paleontology approaches, such as studies on the conservation of DNA in human bone, the quest for ancient DNA in permafrost-frozen fauna, the Tyrolean iceman, and the Neandertals. | ['marota', 'rollo'] | ","['marota', 'rollo']",4

313,"Moose genomes reveal past glacial demography and the origin of modern lineages | Background: Numerous megafauna species from northern latitudes went extinct during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition as a result of climate-induced habitat changes. However, several ungulate species managed to successfully track their habitats during this period to eventually flourish and recolonise the holarctic regions. So far, the genomic impacts of these climate fluctuations on ungulates from high latitudes have been little explored. Here, we assemble a de-novo genome for the European moose (Alces alces) and analyse it together with re-sequenced nuclear genomes and ancient and modern mitogenomes from across the moose range in Eurasia and North America. Results: We found that moose demographic history was greatly influenced by glacial cycles, with demographic responses to the Pleistocene/Holocene transition similar to other temperate ungulates. Our results further support that modern moose lineages trace their origin back to populations that inhabited distinct glacial refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Finally, we found that present day moose in Europe and North America show low to moderate inbreeding levels resulting from post-glacial bottlenecks and founder effects, but no evidence for recent inbreeding resulting from human-induced population declines. Conclusions: Taken together, our results highlight the dynamic recent evolutionary history of the moose and provide an important resource for further genomic studies. ¬© 2020, The Author(s). | ['ahlgren', 'alberti', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'aspi', 'dal√©n', 'dussex', 'd√≠ez', 'del', 'molino', 'd√∂ppes', 'friedrich', 'heino', 'hofreiter', 'laikre', 'lid√©n', 'lindauer', 'olsen', 'rosendahl', 'ryman', 'shaymuratova', 'van', 'der', 'valk'] | ","['ahlgren', 'alberti', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'aspi', 'dal√©n', 'dussex', 'd√≠ez', 'del', 'molino', 'd√∂ppes', 'friedrich', 'heino', 'hofreiter', 'laikre', 'lid√©n', 'lindauer', 'olsen', 'rosendahl', 'ryman', 'shaymuratova', 'van', 'der', 'valk']",1

315,"Morphogenetic aspects and age of Late Holocene eolian drift sands in Northwest Europe | In Northwest Europe resedimentation by wind of terrestrial deposits - mainly Weichselian (Younger) cover sands - since the beginning of the Neolithic up to the present has resulted in the widespread accumulation of drift sands. Apart from historical evidence, little is known about the exact age and origin of these drift sands. Palynological analyses and radiocarbon dating of blown-over peat layers in plateau-dunes, which originated by relief inversion of the originally gently undulating cover sand relief, can contribute to this knowledge. The pollen diagrams enable a subdivision of the Subatlantic pollen zones according to Firbas into several subzones, which appear to be contemporaneous in the various drift sand regions. Moreover the changes in regional vegetation are influenced by farming activities. The initiation of many sand drifts might be closely related to the rapid expansion of plaggen soils in Northwest Europe, which mainly took place between 750 and 1200 A.D. | ['castel', 'koster', 'slotboom'] | ","['castel', 'koster', 'slotboom']",4
316,"A multiple profile approach to the palynological reconstruction of Norse landscapes in Greenland's Eastern Settlement | Palynological research is increasingly revealing the landscape impacts of Norse colonisation in southern Greenland. Typically, although not exclusively, these studies are from depositional environments with highly localised pollen source areas close to fjord-side centres of medieval power. In contrast, this paper presents data from Vatnahverfi, an inland district of the Eastern Settlement, and explores the emergence of a cultural landscape through three pollen sequences at variable distances from Norse farms. Two are from mires with small pollen source areas close to (< 100 m) and distant from (>= 1500 m) probable farming activities. The other provides a more regional signal of vegetation change, albeit one located close to a Norse settlement. Landnam is marked primarily through an increase in microscopic charcoal and the appearance of pollen from Rumex acetosella, although significant differences between profiles are noted. Close to Norse ruins, pollen productivity from grassland communities increases and woodland and scrub representation declines. Further from archaeological remains, palynologically inferred human activity is primarily characterised by decreased productivity, notably declining influx from woodland and scrub species, reflecting grazing herbivores or coppicing. Abandonment of Vatnahverfi is indicated from the late 14th to early 15th century AD. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

317,"Multiproxy analysis of permafrost preserved faeces provides an unprecedented insight into the diets and habitats of extinct and extant megafauna | The study of faecal samples to reconstruct the diets and habitats of extinct megafauna has traditionally relied on pollen and macrofossil analysis. DNA metabarcoding has emerged as a valuable tool to com-plement and refine these proxies. While published studies have compared the results of these three proxies for sediments, this comparison is currently lacking for permafrost preserved mammal faeces. Moreover, most metabarcoding studies have focused on a single plant-specific DNA marker region. In this study, we target both the commonly used chloroplast trnL P6 loop as well as nuclear ribosomal ITS (nrITS). The latter can increase taxonomic resolution of plant identifications but requires DNA to be relatively well preserved because of the target length (similar to 300-500 bp). We compare DNA results to pollen and macrofossil analyses from permafrost and ice-preserved faeces of Pleistocene and Holocene megafauna. Samples include woolly mammoth, horse, steppe bison as well as Holocene and extant caribou. Most plant identifications were found using DNA, likely because the studied faeces contained many vegetative remains that could not be identified using macrofossils or pollen. Several taxa were, however, identified to lower taxonomic levels uniquely with macrofossil and pollen analysis. The nrITS marker provides species level taxonomic resolution for commonly encountered plant families that are hard to distinguish using the other proxies (e.g. Asteraceae, Cyperaceae and Poaceae). Integrating the results from all proxies, we are able to accurately reconstruct known diets and habitats of the extant caribou. Applying this approach to the extinct mammals, we find that the Holocene horse and steppe bison were not strict grazers but mixed feeders living in a marshy wetland environment. The mammoths showed highly varying diets from different non-analogous habitats. This confirms the presence of a mosaic of habitats in the Pleistocene 'mammoth steppe' that mammoths could fully exploit due to their flexibility in food choice. (C) 2021 The Authors.

318,"Muscox utilization in the Canadian Arctic | In view of the drastic growth in the Canadian Inuit population, the rising costs of living, the missing job and income alternatives and the high unemployment rate in the arctic, efforts are being made to make use of the muskox populations in order to provide additional sources of food and/or revenue. The present paper attempts to review the course of muskox utilization in the Canadian Arctic and to tentatively assess its present as well as its future economic importance. Starting with the pre-European status of muskoxen in Canada, the drastic reduction in numbers resulting from the combined efforts of hide traders, whalers and expedition parties in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the impact of the legal protection and the recovery since 1917 are being described. Establishing muskox farms with semi-domesticated herds failed in Canada in the 1970's. Since 1969, though, increasing numbers of animals have been allotted to many Inuit communities, and despite the fact that most of the animals were primarily used for subsistence purposes, some communities could reserve part of their quotas for trophy (sport) hunters. While controlled sustainable subsistence and trophy hunts may eventually be carried out over the whole muskox range, including recently colonized northern Qu√©bec, commercial harvesting for meat, hides and wool, introduced in 1981, will at least for some time be restricted to Banks and Victoria islands which at present show 78 % of the Canadian muskox population and 94 % of the overall quota. | ['treude'] | ",['treude'],1

320,"The mutual climatic range method of palaeoclimate reconstruction based on insect fossils: New applications and interhemispheric comparisons | The Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method of palaeoclimate reconstruction has been employed in Europe for the last decade. A quantitative, calibrated method, MCR has many advantages over qualitative methods. More recent applications deal with eastern and central North America, and the method is also being developed for desert and arctic faunas. The climate envelopes for North American beetles have been compiled using a 25-km gridded North American climate database that pairs climate parameters with modern collection sites. Modern tests of the reliability of the MCR method for North American species yielded similar results to prior European tests. Linear regressions of predicted on observed values yielded equations used to calibrate the MCR estimates. Work is under way to develop MCR estimates of mean annual precipitation for fossil assemblages from the desert southwest, where moisture conditions may play a more important role in determining beetle species' ranges. An examination of British and North American mean July temperature reconstructions during the Late Wisconsinan glacial interval compares and contrasts three sets of records. The North American records show no indication of the Younger Dryas cooling that is clearly marked in records from northwest Europe. The MCR method adds vigour to our reconstructions, and allows us to compare between regions and with other palaeoenvironmental methods. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Samples of wood and bone from the culture layer indicate an age between 7450 and 8200 years B.P. At that time, due to glacial lowering of sea level, Zhokhova Island was substantially larger than at present and may still have been joined to the Asiatic mainland. The main species harvested by the hunters (on the basis of the numbers of bone remains) was reindeer (49.7%) but a remarkable number of polar bears was also being taken (43.8% of bones).

323,"The nature and significance of polar bear conservation hunting in the Canadian Arctic | The history and current status of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) conservation hunting in the Canadian Arctic, where trophy hunts by non-local hunters have steadily increased in number over the past three decades, have been influenced by local and international factors. Although polar bear hides taken in the subsistence hunt have commercial value, revenues from nonresident trophy hunting provide a much greater economic return to the Inuit. Research suggests that these greater cash returns and the increased local interest by Native hunters in outfitting and guiding do not threaten community cultural values, which continue to emphasize subsistence and the conservation of local wildlife resources. These outcomes suggest that community-based polar bear trophy hunts provide an example of a successful conservation-hunting program that contributes to wildlife management and sustainable economic and community development in the Canadian Arctic. | ['freeman', 'wenzel'] | ","['freeman', 'wenzel']",1
324,"Neoichnology of an Arctic fluvial point bar, North Slope, Alaska (USA) | This study is the first to describe the neoichnology of an Arctic fluvial point bar (Colville River, Alaska, USA) and examine the sedimentological effects of tracemakers in this sedimentary setting. Seasonal extremes in discharge and sediment deposition in this system result in sandwaves, current ripples, gravel bars and mud veneers, with the latter forming extensive mudcracks. Organismal traces are abundantly represented in sandy mudflats on the downstream portion of the point bar and are characterized by: (1) abundant shallow horizontal invertebrate burrows and surface trails, directly comparable to Treptichnus, Cochlichnus and Aulichnites; (2) avian tracks and (3) large mammal tracks. Treptichnus-like burrows are attributed to dipteran larvae tracemakers, whereas Cochlichnus- and Helminthoidichnites-like trails were likely from nematodes or oligochaetes. Avian tracks are primarily from seagulls, geese, swans and plovers; mudcracks were connected directly to tracks, which developed as a result of increased amounts of sunlight available during the polar summer. Mammal tracks were dominated by those of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), but include grizzly bear (Ursos arctos) and other mammals. Caribou herds significantly impacted emergent and submergent mudflat surfaces through advection of saturated thixotropic muds and dry sand, while also fracturing mudcracked zones, and hence actively produced mud clasts. Vertebrates thus can cause considerable mixing, redistribution and erosion of sediments in Arctic point bars with only a few months of activity. Ichnodiversity was low but accompanied by high trace abundance, reflecting favorable hydrodynamic, solar and atmospheric conditions throughout a polar summer. In contrast, sedimentation and bioturbation are absent during winter months, when ice cover prevents organismal interactions with fluvial sediments. As a result, the ichnocoenose does not fit easily into paradigms of previously defined continental ichnofacies (e.g., Mermia and Scoyenia) and is more like a composite ichnofacies. These findings can thus serve as a starting point for more detailed studies of circumpolar point bars, while also adding new perspectives to the interpretation of trace fossils in circumpolar fluvial environments. | ['martin'] | ",['martin'],4
325,"Neolithic dairy farming at the extreme of agriculture in northern Europe | The conventional 'Neolithic package' comprised animals and plants originally domesticated in the Near East. As farming spread on a generally northwest trajectory across Europe, early pastoralists would have been faced with the challenge of making farming viable in regions in which the organisms were poorly adapted to providing optimal yields or even surviving. Hence, it has long been debated whether Neolithic economies were ever established at the modern limits of agriculture. Here, we examine food residues in pottery, testing a hypothesis that Neolithic farming was practiced beyond the 60th parallel north. Our findings, based on diagnostic biomarker lipids and delta C-13 values of preserved fatty acids, reveal a transition at ca 2500 BC from the exploitation of aquatic organisms to processing of ruminant products, specifically milk, confirming farming was practiced at high latitudes. Combining this with genetic, environmental and archaeological information, we demonstrate the origins of dairying probably accompanied an incoming, genetically distinct, population successfully establishing this new subsistence 'package'. | ['cramp', 'evershed', 'halinen', 'heyd', 'kettunen', 'lavento', 'mannermaa', 'oinonen', 'onkamo', 'perola'] | ","['cramp', 'evershed', 'halinen', 'heyd', 'kettunen', 'lavento', 'mannermaa', 'oinonen', 'onkamo', 'perola']",1
326,"Neolithic of Nadym-Purovsky watershed: sources and perspectives | The paper describes preliminary results of investigation in 2012 at the Et-to I settlement (Tyumen region, Yamal-Nenets autonomic district), the only known early Neolithic settlement outside of the lower Ob river basin. The site is located at the foot of the Uvyr-Pai Hill - remains of glacial Pleistocene plain, in the middle of the tundra, away from sources of water. In the southern part of the settlement, the semi-pit dwelling No 5 with rectangular pit, 6.4 x 3.5 m in size and a depth of 0.9-1.0 m was excavated. The pit is divided into two chambers by earthen partition wide of 1 m and a height of 0.5 m from the floor. Grooves for base of wooden panels around the perimeter of the chambers at their bottom were traced. Entrance in the form of in-depth corridor ran off from the partition. Not far from the dwelling a storage bean-shaped pit with vertical walls and rounded bottom (sizes 2 x 3 m, depth 1.5 m) and a knapping ground were located. Pottery from the dwelling presents fragments of 4 egg-shaped vessels with comb pattern. Stone assemblage found inside and around the dwelling is related mainly to primary processing of raw material: pebbles with flake negatives, chipped pebbles, debitage and few cores. Bipolar technique and direct flaking of pebbles of siliceous rocks, quartzite and quartz were in use. Implements include some retouched flakes and worn pieces with natural edges. The assemblage of dwelling 5 is identical to those of previously studied dwellings No 3 and 4, relating to the ettovsky cultural type. Dwellings 5 and 3 were simultaneous (fragments of the same vessel have been found in both of them). The new data confirm the interpretation of three dwellings as lithic-knapping site for percussion of raw material which is abundant in soil and natural sediments at the settlement area. Dwelling No 2 differs from the latter; it is determined as a seasonal habitat of hunting group in the cold season. The new data put questions about the settlement area of ettovsky cultural type in the Pyakupur river basin, on its relationship with the sites of amninsky type at Kazym river (the upper basin of Ob river), the system of natural resource use by holders of ettovsky type. Stone raw material procured at the Et-to I lithic-knapping site probably was intended for settlements located in lowland areas where it is absent. Quartzite species from Uvyr-pai can become determining raw material since it is more rare then quartz rock. The most important component of the food resources for the inhabitants of the Et-to I site was allegedly hunting for ungulates, namely reindeer.

A recent extraction protocol reveals the possibility of obtaining DNA from past insect remains without causing visual morphological damage. We test the applicability of this protocol on historic museum beetle specimens dating back to AD 1820 and on ancient beetle chitin remains from permafrost (permanently frozen soil) dating back more than 47,000 years. Finally, we test the possibility of obtaining ancient insect DNA directly from non-frozen sediments deposited 3280-1800 years ago - an alternative approach that also does not involve destruction of valuable material.Methodology/Principal Findings: The success of the methodological approaches are tested by PCR and sequencing of COI and 16S mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments of 77-204 base pairs (-bp) in size using species-specific and general insect primers.Conclusion/Significance: The applied non-destructive DNA extraction method shows promising potential on insect museum specimens of historical age as far back as AD 1820, but less so on the ancient permafrost-preserved insect fossil remains tested, where DNA was obtained from samples up to ca. 26,000 years old.

331,"Non-native species in the vascular flora of highlands and mountains of Iceland | The highlands and mountains of Iceland are one of the largest remaining wilderness areas in Europe. This study aimed to provide comprehensive and up-to-date data on non-native plant species in these areas and to answer the following questions: (1) How many non-native vascular plant species inhabit highland and mountainous environments in Iceland? (2) Do temporal trends in the immigration of alien species to Iceland differ between highland and lowland areas? (3) Does the incidence of alien species in the disturbed and undisturbed areas within Icelandic highlands differ? (4) Does the spread of non-native species in Iceland proceed from lowlands to highlands? and (5) Can we detect hot-spots in the distribution of non-native taxa within the highlands? Overall, 16 non-native vascular plant species were detected, including 11 casuals and 5 naturalized taxa (1 invasive). Results showed that temporal trends in alien species immigration to highland and lowland areas are similar, but it is clear that the process of colonization of highland areas is still in its initial phase. Non-native plants tended to occur close to man-made infrastructure and buildings including huts, shelters, roads etc. Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns showed that the spread within highland areas is a second step in non-native plant colonization in Iceland. Several statically significant hot spots of alien plant occurrences were identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic and these were linked to human disturbance. This research suggests that human-mediated dispersal is the main driving force increasing the risk of invasion in Iceland's highlands and mountain areas. | ['wasowicz'] | ",['wasowicz'],4

333,"Norse Greenland dietary economy ca. AD 980-ca. AD 1450: Introduction | An initial study of the 13C values for human bone collagen of 27 Norse Greenlanders in the late 1990s suggested a change in the Norse diet from predominantly terrestrial to predominantly marine food. This shift may well indicate a change in diet; the question left open by the limited initial isotope study was, however, whether the change in diet was a reflection of altered subsistence strategies or altered farming practices. Furthermore, the first study did not convincingly answer the question of whether the dietary change occurred gradually over time or within the space of a few years - and, if the latter case, when? Neither did it answer questions concerning dietary differences between the two Norse settlements, between individual farms and between the sexes, or the nature of the marine food that was consumed. Distinguishing locally born people from foreigners is yet another matter for investigation in order to leave out of account persons that grew up outside of Greenland. This new study includes 437 samples: 183 from humans - 118 Norse and 65 Inuit - and 254 from animals. The samples are from 19 Norse sites (farms): 13 from the Eastern Settlement and 6 are from the Western Settlement. For comparison, we have also included samples from both humans and animals from 22 Inuit sites. This paper sets the scene for the new study and the following papers in this Special Volume. Former studies in Norse diet and Norse resource utilization are recapitulated, and all the Norse sites represented in the study are presented, as are all the samples included in the study. Chronology is a recurrent problem in Norse archaeology, and our focus, in particular, is on the attempt to date the samples included in the study that have not been radiocarbon dated. | ['arneborg', 'heinemeier', 'lynnerup', 'm√∏hl', 'rud', 'sveinbj√∂rnsd√≥ttir'] | ","['arneborg', 'heinemeier', 'lynnerup', 'm√∏hl', 'rud', 'sveinbj√∂rnsd√≥ttir']",1
334,"A 'North Atlantic island signature' of timber exploitation: Evidence from wooden artefact assemblages from Viking Age and Medieval Iceland | Throughout history, wood has been of key importance to many human communities both as a source of fuel and as material for construction. This applies not only in areas with plentiful woodlands or forests, but also in more marginal island environments where limited native wood resources are available. In such environments, the use of 'exotic' timber such as driftwood or imported wood plays a key role in resource provision. The exploration of patterns of use of both native and 'exotic' woods in wood-poor environments has great potential to contribute to discussions of resource management and control and human response to landscape change. Using Iceland as a case study, this paper compares wood anatomical analyses of artefact assemblages from across Europe to determine the likely origin of wood (native, imported, drifted) from archaeological sites in the North Atlantic islands, and demonstrates the emergence of an 'island signature' in wood utilisation patterns in this region. The paper also highlights the potential pitfalls of the categorisation of wood remains through taxonomic determination, and examines how these obstacles might be overcome in future research. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. | ['mooney'] | ",['mooney'],1
335,"Where were the northern elephant seals? Holocene archaeology and biogeography of Mirounga angustirostris | Driven to the brink of extinction during the nineteenth century commercial fur and oil trade, northern elephant seal (NES, Mirounga angustirostris) populations now exceed 100 000 animals in the northeast Pacific from Alaska to Baja California. Because little is known about the biogeography and ecology of NES prior to the mid-nineteenth century, we synthesize and analyze the occurrence of NES remains in North American archaeological sites. Comparing these archaeological data with modern biogeographical, genetic, and behavioral data, we provide a trans-Holocene perspective on NES distribution and abundance. Compared with other pinnipeds, NES bones are relatively rare throughout the Holocene, even in California where they currently breed in large numbers. Low numbers of NES north of California match contemporary NES distribution, but extremely low occurrences in California suggest their abundance in this area was very different during the Holocene than today. We propose four hypotheses to explain this discrepancy, concluding that ancient human settlement and other activities may have displaced NES from many of their preferred modern habitats during much of the Holocene. | ['arnold', 'braje', 'delong', 'de', 'lauriers', 'erlandson', 'hildebrandt', 'jones', 'kennett', 'rick', 'vellanoweth', 'wake'] | ","['arnold', 'braje', 'delong', 'de', 'lauriers', 'erlandson', 'hildebrandt', 'jones', 'kennett', 'rick', 'vellanoweth', 'wake']",1
336,"Northern polar coastal wetlands | Northern Polar coastal wetlands contain habitats of great importance to wildlife and human populations. Their distribution is determined by underlying geoecological events and processes. They are characterized by cold climate and the presence of ice (sea ice and permafrost) and are influenced by other biotic and abiotic processes (sedimentation, salinity, tidal action, and freshwater input). Pleistocene ice sheets have molded the landscape, and their retreat and subsequent isostatic uplift have led to continuing postglacial local land emersion. Diversity of Arctic wetland plants and fauna is relatively low and characterized by few, widely distributed species; diversity decreases at higher latitudes. On the Russian Arctic coast, progressive deglaciation has favored northward migration of plants from Atlantic/European sources to western areas and Pacific/American ones to eastern areas. Arctic wetlands are of major importance for waterbirds as breeding and migration areas; they are vulnerable to a wide variety of environmental changes, especially climatic change. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

338,"The Nunatak Theory Ii. The Problem of Endemism | A high percentage of endemism is usually taken as an indication of high age of a flora. The apparent lack of endemic species within areas glaciated during the Pleistocene was taken as an argument for the tabula rasa hypothesis. However, further taxonomic studies have revealed a number of species and subspecies endemic to Fennoscandia (including Kola) and to the British Isles. The endemics can be grouped in different categories. The most numerous group (Table 1) consists of subalpine-alpine taxa suspected to be glacial survivors in Scandinavia 18 are endemic species or represented by endemic subspecies, i.e. a percentage of 7.8. The next group (Table 2) are sea-shore endemics, one of which, Euphrasia bottnica has its nearest relatives in Eastern North America and must be interpreted as an old relict. Many are restricted to large brackish water estuaries only found within the glaciated areas in Europe. Migration along the sea-shores have perhaps aided the endemics to migrate from wherever they lived during maximum glaciation into their present areas which clearly were glaciated. The third group (Table 3) consists of an element consisting mainly of dry habitat plants growing in steppe-like communities concentrated in Oland in Sweden and Teesdale in England. These are supposed to be relicts from the steppe communities dominating the unglaciated lowlands of Europe 18000 years ago. This is supported by late-glacial presence of pollen (e.g. of Helianthemum oelandicum) and macrofossils (e.g. Potentilla fruticosa) outside their present area. A few are associated with calcareous mires. The last group (Table 4) is a mixture of different elements. Several are restricted to serpentine or heavy metal soils. Some are found exclusively in man-made habitats. Most of the remaining taxa may have arisen by crossing and/or polyploidy. In the Mediterranean the altitudes of the vegetation belts were depressed more than 1000 m during maximum Weichselian glaciation. This led to an extinction of local endemics which for physiologic reasons are restricted to low altitude. Time since maximum glaciation (1800 years) has not been sufficient for evolution of new endemic taxa. Hence the Mediterranean flora is devoid of local endemics exclusive for altitudes below 1000 m (apart from species restricted to coastal areas, or found on islands with altitudes less than 1000 m). However, in Macaronesia, where climate was less affected by the Pleistocene glaciations, exclusive lowlands endemics (altitudinal limit less than 500 m) are abundant. The following thesis is offered for falsification: There is no known instance where it can convincingly be demonstrated that a new amphimictic vascular plant species or subspecies has evolved by purely genetic processes other than alloploidy during the last 18000 years. | ['dahl'] | ",['dahl'],1

Both of these localities are north of 80¬∞N. New radiocarbon age determinations, together with earlier results, show that Mytilus colonies were present in this area for much of the first half of Holocene time - from approximately 9000 to 5800 14C yr BP. Mytilus has also been recorded farther south in Nordaustlandet, at three localities in Wahlenbergfjorden. Age determinations of shells at two of these sites have yielded results in the range of 7400 to 6900 14C yr BP. The arrival of Mytilus to Nordaustlandet coincided with the early Holocene influx of warm North Atlantic Water off the west coast of Spitsbergen. The drastic warming in early Holocene time, which resulted in the rapid melt-off of glaciers and ice caps in Svalbard, also facilitated the establishment and perserverance of Mytilus colonies at this high latitude. | ['blake', 'jr'] | ","['blake', 'jr']",4

344,"One person's food: How and why fish avoidance may affect the settlement and subsistence patterns of hunter-gatherers | Foraging strategies of modem hunter-gatherers may not accurately model resource use of specialized big-game hunters. Historic accounts from the Northern Plains of North America indicate that utilization of spring-spawning fish when large mammals were fat-depleted was not universally beneficial. Three independent reports from Europeans and Americans show that a sudden switch from a prolonged diet of lean red meal to fish produces symptoms consistent with lipid (fat) malabsorption. Ir is hypothesized that plains-adapted hunter-gatherers formed their camps in grassland environments and hunted big game throughout the winter The effects of eating lean meat alone were avoided by utilizing feral and newborn animals and through the use of stored carbohydrate-rich foods. Groups associated with wooded environments wintered along the margins of the winter grazing range. They followed a diverse strategy wit opportunistic use big game and were able to exploit spring-spawning fish. Archaeological remains from 18 sites from the plains, parkland, and forests of Western Canada were used to test these hypotheses. The faunal assemblages, tools, and identifications of lipid residues from pottery vessels were consistent,vith the proposed strategies. | ['malainey', 'przybylski', 'sherriff'] | ","['malainey', 'przybylski', 'sherriff']",1
345,"Optical dating of perennially frozen deposits associated with preserved ancient plant and animal DNA in north-central Siberia | We present chronological constraints on a suite of permanently frozen fluvial deposits which contain ancient DNA (aDNA) from the Taimyr Peninsula of north-central Siberia. The luminescence phenomenology of these samples is first discussed, focusing on the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) decay curve characteristics, thermoluminescence (TL) properties, and signal compositions of quartz from these previously unstudied deposits. Secondly, we assess the suitability of these samples for OSL dating and present the OSL chronologies obtained using both single-grain and multi-grain equivalent dose (De) measurements. The results of our analyses reveal a large amount of inter-aliquot variability in OSL decay curve shape that is directly related to differences in the size of the 280 degrees C TL peak and the associated slowly bleached 'S2' OSL component. Longer OSL stimulation durations are adopted in the D, measurement procedure to prevent the progressive build-up of slowly bleached signal components throughout successive single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) measurement cycles. The use of low preheat temperatures in the SAR procedure also reduces the deleterious effects of these slowly bleached signal components. The resultant single-grain and multi-grain OSL chronologies obtained using this approach are stratigraphically consistent and are in close agreement with independently established 14 C ages at our sites. The findings of this research reveal the potential of OSL dating as a means of providing a reliable chronometric framework for sedimentary aDNA records in permafrost environments.

346,"Optimizing extraction and targeted capture of ancient environmental DNA for reconstructing past environments using the PalaeoChip Arctic-1.0 bait-set | Sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) has been established as a viable biomolecular proxy for tracking taxon presence through time in a local environment, even in the total absence of surviving tissues. SedaDNA is thought to survive through mineral binding, facilitating long-term biomolecular preservation, but also challenging DNA isolation. Two common limitations in sedaDNA extraction are the carryover of other substances that inhibit enzymatic reactions, and the loss of authentic sedaDNA when attempting to reduce inhibitor co-elution. Here, we present a sedaDNA extraction procedure paired with targeted enrichment intended to maximize DNA recovery. Our procedure exhibits a 7.7-19.3x increase in on-target plant and animal sedaDNA compared to a commercial soil extraction kit, and a 1.2-59.9x increase compared to a metabarcoding approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of our cold spin extraction and PalaeoChip capture enrichment approach, we present results for the diachronic presence of plants and animals from Yukon permafrost samples dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, and discuss new potential evidence for the late survival (similar to 9700 years ago) of mammoth (Mammuthus sp.) and horse (Equus sp.) in the Klondike region of Yukon, Canada.

347,"Origin and colonization of few species in Iceland | Climate changes during Pleistocene have caused changes in species range and led to increased diversity within species and even speciation. These effects are prominent at high latitudes in areas which were covered by glaciers during the cold periods of Ice Age, including Iceland. Genetic variation within species is characterised by little variation over extended geographic areas but with sharp boundaries between those areas. In this article I review studies on genetic variation of various species in Iceland, reflecting their history, phylogeography and their colonisation of Iceland. In addition I will describe the contribution of Agriar Ingolfsson to this field. Agnar studied hybridization of glaucous and herring gulls, studied the biogeography of the coastal biota and critically evaluated claims that species had survived in refugia in Iceland. The main result of these studies is that it is difficult to generalize about the origin and colonization of species in Iceland. Even though most species originate in Europe, there are examples of American origin and of admixture of populations from both continents. The variation, which generally reflect historical population size, can be small or large depending on whether admixture has occurred from different populations or even different species.The genetic patterns are further dependent on the species dispersal capacity and also the adaptation of species to live in vicinity of the ice edge or even underneath the glaciers. Genetic variation supports putative refugia during the cold periods of Ice Age in marine environment and provides evidence for the survival of groundwater amphipods at the boundaries of the tectonic plates in Iceland. The geographic isolation of Iceland and its geology may have further augmented the diversification of certain species and shaped their genetic patterns. | ['palsson'] | ",['palsson'],1
348,"Origins and development of maritime adaptations in the northwest pacific region of north America: A zooarchaeological perspective | Current geological, paleoenvironmental, and archaeological data suggest that maritime adaptations probably did not develop over a period of thousands of years on the south coast of the Bering Land Bridge or adjacent regions. Such adaptations appeared in the early Holocene, and may be related to both 'push' and 'pull' phenomena: the deterioration of the interior Alaskan environment as a habitat for early Holocene populations; and the potential in deglaciated landscapes to obtain deep-sea fish, sea mammals, sea birds, and limited amounts of invertebrate species (mollusks and echinoderms). As environmental conditions evolved into mid-Holocene times, and particularly with stabilization of rising sea levels throughout much of south coastal Alaska and adjacent coastal British Columbia, use of shellfish and salmon increased. These resources allowed stabilization of the annual energy base of the food quest, a reduction of resource seasonality, and consequently the support of larger human populations. Population growth in turn created demand for additional resources, leading to further intensification of the food quest, impacts on some animal species populations, and the development of sociopolitical solutions to problems of resource availability. | ['yesner'] | ",['yesner'],4
349,"Origins and diversity of the Bering Sea Island fauna: shifting linkages across the northern continents | We synthesize the historical biogeography of non-marine fauna (mammals, birds, fish, non-parasitic and parasitic invertebrates) occurring across Bering Sea islands, considering endemism, species with origins in both North America and Far East Asia, and the impacts of introduced species through the Bering region. Insular communities often constitute assemblages of unique evolutionary lineages that reflect both neutral and selective processes of diversification as a consequence of isolation and through responses to in situ environmental change. However, current knowledge of the basic distribution, ecology, and evolutionary identity of the majority of terrestrial species through the Bering Sea region is still generally lacking. A preponderance of scientific effort associated with these islands has instead focused on conservation and management of marine-associated species and economically viable biological resources. Given the critical role that terrestrial environments play in maintaining evolutionary and ecological linkages between land and sea, a greater understanding of existing biodiversity, and the biological processes that influence community integrity through this remote region is warranted. Resolving responses of resident insular species to rapidly warming Arctic climate and to modern human-associated disturbances provides valuable insight for effective management of future population trajectories and for revealing the dynamics of intra- and inter-specific connectivity across the northern hemisphere and between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The location of this region at a high-latitude cross-roads has led to a preponderance of island taxa having trans-Beringian distributions. Species associated with the Palearctic or the Nearctic occur across a strong longitudinal gradient, reflecting the role of the Bering Sea as a dispersal filter between mainland areas. Aleutian oceanic islands reflect different biogeographic histories among taxonomic groups from land-bridge islands of the Bering Sea. We discuss evidence of recent biodiversity responses to modern environmental perturbations, including continued colonisations and novel species interactions, and call for increased scientific scrutiny of terrestrial fauna across these remote outposts. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. | ['combe', 'hope', 'sikes', 'tkach'] | ","['combe', 'hope', 'sikes', 'tkach']",1
350,"Origin of the driftwood on the coasts of Iceland; a dendrochronological study | In many places along the extensive coastline of Iceland driftwood has been washed ashore over a long period of time. Although the amount of driftwood varies from place to place it is found on almost every beach along the coast. The wood originates in the boreal forest regions of Russia/Siberia. Rivers which drain these forested areas carry driftwood into the Arctic Ocean, where it is caught in drifting ice and transported by the oceanic currents. At present most of the Pinus and Picea driftwood reaching Iceland are logs that came loose during timber floating on the Russian/Siberian rivers, whereas most of the Larix driftwood has a 'natural' origin, with their root system preserved. Because of the relatively short buoyancy time of the driftwood - most of its travel must have taken place frozen in sea ice - it can be concluded that some of the drift-ice reaching Iceland has the same origin as the driftwood ie, the Barents and Siberian seas. The youngest dated sample indicates that it is possible for arctic driftwood to reach the coasts of Iceland in less than six years. -from Author | ['eggertsson'] | ",['eggertsson'],1
351,"On the origin of the Norwegian lemming | The Pleistocene glacial cycles resulted in significant changes in species distributions, and it has been discussed whether this caused increased rates of population divergence and speciation. One species that is likely to have evolved during the Pleistocene is the Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus). However, the origin of this species, both in terms of when and from what ancestral taxon it evolved, has been difficult to ascertain. Here, we use ancient DNA recovered from lemming remains from a series of Late Pleistocene and Holocene sites to explore the species' evolutionary history. The results revealed considerable genetic differentiation between glacial and contemporary samples. Moreover, the analyses provided strong support for a divergence time prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), therefore likely ruling out a postglacial colonization of Scandinavia. Consequently, it appears that the Norwegian lemming evolved from a small population that survived the LGM in an ice-free Scandinavian refugium. | ['abramson', 'angerbjorn', 'dalen', 'ehrich', 'germonpre', 'kalthoff', 'lagerholm', 'nadachowski', 'sandoval', 'castellanos', 'stewart'] | ","['abramson', 'angerbjorn', 'dalen', 'ehrich', 'germonpre', 'kalthoff', 'lagerholm', 'nadachowski', 'sandoval', 'castellanos', 'stewart']",4
352,"Origin of the ornamented baton perce from the Golebiewo site 47 as a trigger of discussion on long-distance exchange among Early Mesolithic communities of Central Poland and Northern Europe | This article describes evidence for contact and exchange among Mesolithic communities in Poland and Scandinavia, based on the interdisciplinary analysis of an ornamented baton perce A from Golebiewo site 47 (Central Poland). Typological and chronological-cultural analyses show the artefact to be most likely produced in the North European Plain, during the Boreal period. Carbon-14 dating confirms the antiquity of the artefact. Ancient DNA analysis shows the artefact to be of Rangifer tarandus antler. Following this species designation, a dispersion analysis of Early-Holocene reindeer remains in Europe was conducted, showing this species to exist only in northern Scandinavia and north-western Russia in this period. Therefore, the baton from Golebiewo constitutes the youngest reindeer remains in the European Plain and south-western Scandinavia known to date. An attempt was made to determine the biogeographic region from which the antler used to produce the artefact originates from. To this end, comprehensive delta(18) O, delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope analyses were performed. North Karelia and South Lapland were determined as the most probable regions in terms of isotopic data, results which correspond to the known distribution range of Rangifer tarandus at this time. In light of these finds, the likelihood of contact between Scandinavia and Central Europe in Early Holocene is evaluated. The baton perce A from Golebiewo is likely key evidence for long-distance exchange during the Boreal period. | ['cienkosz', 'stepanczak', 'jedrychowska', 'danska', 'kuriga', 'lisowska', 'gaczorek', 'makowiecki', 'osipowicz', 'ploszaj', 'reitsema', 'szostek', 'witas'] | ","['cienkosz', 'stepanczak', 'jedrychowska', 'danska', 'kuriga', 'lisowska', 'gaczorek', 'makowiecki', 'osipowicz', 'ploszaj', 'reitsema', 'szostek', 'witas']",1

Twelve cestode species have broad Palearctic distributions, three belong to the Western-Asian-European faunistic complex, and only two are endemic to the European zone. Postglacial expansion into the European territory resulted in geographic colonization by sixteen species. The large number of cestode species with transpalearctic ranges, as well as paleontological data indicating a nearly complete faunal turnover for species of Sorex in the Pleistocene, suggests that these parasites are more ancient than the assemblage of contemporary hosts in which they now occur, and thus represent ecological relicts. We suggest that origins of the cestode fauna pre-date those of the modern fauna of its hosts, and that initial formation and radiation occurred not later than the Pliocene. In the current review, we outline testable hypotheses to explore the structure, history and development of this fauna which appears limited to species of Sorex. | ['binkiene', 'hoberg', 'kontrimavichus'] | ","['binkiene', 'hoberg', 'kontrimavichus']",1

357,"Palaeo-environmental and dietary analysis of intestinal contents of a mammoth calf (Yamal Peninsula, northwest Siberia) | Intestinal samples from the one-month-old Siberian mammoth calf 'Lyuba' were studied using light microscopy and ancient DNA to reconstruct its palaeo-environment and diet. The palynological record indicates a 'mammoth steppe'. At least some pollen of arboreal taxa was reworked, and thus the presence of trees on the landscape is uncertain. In addition to visual comparison of 11 microfossil spectra, a PCA analysis contributed to diet reconstruction. This yielded two clusters: one of samples from the small intestine and the other of large-intestine samples, indicating compositional differences in food remains along the intestinal tract, possibly reflecting different episodes of ingestion. Based on observed morphological damage we conclude that the cyperaceous plant remains and some remains of dwarf willows were originally eaten by a mature mammoth, most likely Lyuba's mother. The mammoth calf probably unintentionally swallowed well-preserved mosses and mineral particles while eating fecal material deposited on a soil surface covered with mosses. Coprophagy may have been a common habit for mammoths, and we therefore propose that fecal material should not be used to infer season of death of mammoths. DNA sequences of trnL and rbcL genes amplified from ancient DNA extracted from intestinal samples confirmed and supplemented plant identifications based on microfossils and macro-remains. Results from different extraction methods and barcoding markers complemented each other and show the value of longer protocols in addition to fast and commercially available extraction kits.

358,"Palaeo-oceanographic development and human adaptive strategies in the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: A study from the Norwegian coast | The human colonization of Norway occurred in the Pleistocene-Holocene transition - one of the most abrupt and severe climatic shifts in human history. For 1500years (9500-8000 bc), the whole coast was occupied by mobile, marine-oriented hunter-gatherers. This paper explores dynamic relations between human adaptation and marine environmental variations in this period. An updated record of archaeological sites and palaeo-oceanographic data suggests a correlation between marine productivity and site distribution and density. The data further demonstrate spatial and temporal differences in the environment. A cooling pulse at 9300-9200 bc (the Preboreal Oscillation) with widespread ecological consequences must have been noticeable to humans occupying Norwegian landscapes. A more gradual shift occurred around 8800 bc when the arctic climate gave way to warmer conditions: The Norwegian Atlantic current stabilized, all fjord systems became ice-free, and animal diversity increased. In the northernmost region, the impact of Atlantic water was less severe, and Polar conditions with more sea ice seem to have lingered throughout the period. Variations in the site pattern may be related to these fluctuations in the resource situation. Variations in the lithic industry, on the other hand, seem to be connected to technological choices or local traditions, rather than environmental dissimilarities. The archaeological record indicates that the lifestyle, which developed under arctic conditions, was maintained through a flexible mobility pattern and a versatile tool technology, but the Norwegian coast also provided a good base to uphold such a lifestyle. | ['breivik'] | ",['breivik'],1
359,"Palaeoenvironmental evidence for woodland conservation in Northern Iceland from settlement to the twentieth century | Narratives of Norse arrival in Iceland highlight the onset of land degradation and loss of woodland cover as major and long-term environmental consequences of settlement. However, deliberate and sustained land resource management in Iceland is increasingly being recognised, and in this paper we assess whether woodland areas were deliberately managed as fuel resources. Our study location is the high status farm site at Hofstaoir in northern Iceland. A palynological record was obtained from a small basin located just inside the farm boundary wall and the geoarchaeological record of fuel use obtained from waste midden deposits associated with the farm. Both environmental records are temporally constrained by tephrochronology and archaeological records. When viewed within the broader landscape setting, our findings suggest that there was near continuous use of birch wood from early settlement to the present day, that it was actively conserved throughout the occupation of the site and that there were clear distinctions in fuel resource utilisation for domestic and more industrial purposes. Our analyses open discussion on the role of local woodlands and their management in the Norse farm economy. | ['barclay', 'mcculloch', 'nichol', 'simpson', 'smith', 'tisdall', 'vesteinsson'] | ","['barclay', 'mcculloch', 'nichol', 'simpson', 'smith', 'tisdall', 'vesteinsson']",4

It was established that the earthquake that generated the seismic fault trench system occurred in the Late Glacial or Early Holocene with the formation of a seismic underwater fracture, and the trench ""opened""because of the subsequent lifting of the bottom, erosion and removal of fragmented rocks in the wave-breaking zone shortly before filling it with Holocene sediments. Sediments that filled the paleoseismic trench accumulated over the period from 9 ka BP to the present, with a break for passage through the coastal zone. They demonstrate a successive change from marine sedimentary environment (gray silt with Hiatella arc-tica shells, dated back to 9 ka BP) to coastal-marine (sand with clasts), then again to an isolated, gradually desalinated lagoon-type sea gulf (mica silt dated back to 3 ka BP), and ultimately - swamp overgrown with spruce forest (woody peat dated back to 2 ka BP). The structure of the upper part of the section could be caused by a) a weak rise in sea level in the Late Holocene, or b) a weak lowering of the block of the earth's crust with a seismic trench located on it. New data were obtained on specific features of subfossil malacofauna taphocoenosis formation in the Kandalaksha Bay of the White Sea and on the changes of sedimentation environment under the conditions of rising coast. The traces of strong seismicity in the Late Galcial epoch and postglacial time were discovered. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to the study of seismogenic forms combined with a full range of age-related markers of various pa-leogeographic events proved to be very productive. ¬© 2020. | ['kutenkov', 'kuznetsov', 'ludikova', 'shvarev', 'zaretskaya'] | ","['kutenkov', 'kuznetsov', 'ludikova', 'shvarev', 'zaretskaya']",4

Genera Salix, Lychnis, Silene, Draba, Potentilla, Larix, and families Poaceae, Polygonaceae, Cyperaceae, Compositae, and Leguminosae are determined among palynological remains and megafossils. Factors responsible for qualitative and quantitative differences in taxonomic compositions of palynological and megafossil assemblages are biological peculiarities of plants, different character of fossilization of palynomorphs and large plant remains, geographic conditions, different genesis of assemblages (allochthonous for microfossils and autochthonous for megafossils), and inadequately known morphology of certain spore and pollen taxa.

362,"Paleodistribution modeling suggests glacial refugia in Scandinavia and out-of-Tibet range expansion of the Arctic fox | Quaternary glacial cycles have shaped the geographic distributions and evolution of numerous species in the Arctic. Ancient DNA suggests that the Arctic fox went extinct in Europe at the end of the Pleistocene and that Scandinavia was subsequently recolonized from Siberia, indicating inability to track its habitat through space as climate changed. Using ecological niche modeling, we found that climatically suitable conditions for Arctic fox were found in Scandinavia both during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the mid-Holocene. Our results are supported by fossil occurrences from the last glacial. Furthermore, the model projection for the LGM, validated with fossil records, suggested an approximate distance of 2000 km between suitable Arctic conditions and the Tibetan Plateau well within the dispersal distance of the species, supporting the recently proposed hypothesis of range expansion from an origin on the Tibetan Plateau to the rest of Eurasia. The fact that the Arctic fox disappeared from Scandinavia despite suitable conditions suggests that extant populations may be more sensitive to climate change than previously thought. | ['fuentes', 'hurtado', 'hof', 'jansson'] | ","['fuentes', 'hurtado', 'hof', 'jansson']",1

364,"Rates, pathways and drivers for peatland development in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, northern Ontario, Canada | 1 The Hudson Bay Lowlands have been rising isostatically for the past 7000 years, creating a regional chronosequence as new land emerges from the sea. Rates of uplift are most rapid in the eastern portion of the lowlands near the lower Albany River study area. 2 The stratigraphy of three raised bogs was investigated to determine rates and pathways of peatland development in the Albany River region. The bogs are distributed evenly along the regional chronosequence from the oldest site at Oldman (5980 ¬± 100 BP) to progressively younger sites at Albany River (4810 ¬± 70) and Belec Lake (3960 ¬± 60). 3 Each bog had the same stratigraphic sequence, beginning with a basal tidal marsh assemblage that was rapidly replaced by a Larix-dominated swamp forest, followed by a Picea-forested bog, and ultimately a non-forested bog. The bog-fen boundary is marked by the disappearance of fen indicators, dominance of bog-forming Sphagna, and a sharp decline in nitrogen. Each of these successional stages was associated with different rates of vertical growth. 4 The rate of successional change was more rapid at the younger sites, and their vertical growth curve was more curvilinear. The formation of a raised bog, for example, was 1.3 times more rapid at Albany River and 5.5 times more rapid at Belec Lake than at Oldman. Belec Lake reached its ultimate successional stage first, although it was the last site to emerge from the sea. 5 The differential rate of isostatic uplift across this region rather than climate was the principal environmental driver for peatland development. The faster rate of uplift on the lower reaches of the drainage basin continues to reduce the regional slope, impede drainage and shift river channels, continually altering the local hydrogeological setting. 6 Groundwater flow simulations based on the Dupuit equation show that the growth of these raised bogs was probably constrained by their local hydrogeological setting. Bog formation was first induced by the creation of interfluvial divides between headwardly eroding streams or shifting river channels, and further bog growth was ultimately constrained by the width of the interfluve and the depth of river incision. The Belec Lake bog was the first to approach its limiting height because its narrow interfluve could only support a low water-table mound. 7 Although peatland succession largely followed the same conservative pathway at each site, both the pace and direction of these pathways were set by geological processes, which are probably the decisive drivers for the evolution of this large peat basin. | ['glaser', 'hansen', 'morin', 'reeve', 'siegel'] | ","['glaser', 'hansen', 'morin', 'reeve', 'siegel']",4
365,"Patterns of faunal extinction and paleoclimatic change from mid-Holocene mammoth and polar bear remains, Pribilof Islands, Alaska | Qagnax Cave, a lava tube cave on St. Paul Island in the Pribilofs, has recently produced a mid-Holocene vertebrate faunal assemblage including woolly mammoth, polar bear, caribou, and Arctic fox. Several dates on the mammoth remains converge on 5700 C-14 yr BP. These dates, similar to 2300 yr younger than mammoth dates previously published from the Pribilof Islands, make these the youngest remains of proboscideans, and of non-extinct Quaternary megafauna, recovered from North America. Persistence of mammoths on the Pribilofs is most parsimoniously explained by the isolation of the Pribilofs and the lack of human presence in pre-Russian contact times, but an additional factor may have been the local existence of high-quality forage in the form of grasses enriched by nutrients derived from local Holocene tephras. This interpretation is reinforced by stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values obtained from the mammoth remains. The endpoint of mammoth survival in the Pribilofs is unknown, but maybe coterminous with the arrival of polar bears whose remains in the cave date to the Neoglacial cold period of similar to 4500 to 3500 C-14 yr BP. The polar bear record corroborates a widespread cooling of the Bering Sea region at that time.

367,"Arctic Peatlands of the Yamal-Gydan Province of Western Siberia | Based on the seminal works of the foregoing researchers, this paper focuses on peat formation processes that occur under the extreme climatic and permafrost conditions of the northern part of Western Siberia. It has been shown that in spite the extreme climatic and permafrost conditions, but more likely because of them, peatlands up to 7.5 m thick reinforced with large ice wedges occupy extensive areas in the tundra zone. Vertical growth of peatlands was found to be most intensive (at a rate 1.5-4.4 mm/year) in a limited time period from 9 to 6 ky BP, which suggests that lower horizons of peatlands up to 3.0-4.5 m thick accumulated in just 1500 years. The three reasons that determined the active vertical growth of peatlands have been identiÔ¨Åed and thoroughly discussed in this research: huge ice content, abundance of wood residues in peatlands, and intense frost heaving during the freezing of a newly formed peat layer. Premised on our Ô¨Å nding that birch stands with high bonitet level grew in the tundra only locally, in the areas underlain by insulation-radiogenic taliks, it is proved that in the Holocene, there was no northward shift of 400-500 km in the northern boundary of the forest tundra. –ù–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–¥—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –≤ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–µ –∞–∫—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è—Ö —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –≤ —Å—É—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –≥–µ–æ–∫—Ä–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–µ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏. –ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ, –Ω–µ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä—è –Ω–∞ —Å—É—Ä–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç—å –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –≥–µ–æ–∫—Ä–∏–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–π, –∞ —Å–∫–æ—Ä–µ–µ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ, –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è –∏–º, —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –º–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –¥–æ 7.5 –º, –∞—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∫–ª–∏–Ω—å—è–º–∏ –ª—å–¥–∞, –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—é—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–µ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏ –≤ —Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –∑–æ–Ω–µ. –í—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å (9000-6000 –ª–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥) —ç–ø–æ—Ö–∏ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ—Ä—Ç–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ —Å–æ —Å–∫–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—å—é 1.5-4.4 –º–º/–≥–æ–¥, –≤—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∏–∂–Ω–∏–µ –≥–æ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–Ω—Ç—ã —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –º–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –¥–æ 3.0-4.5 –º –Ω–∞–∫–∞–ø–ª–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –∑–∞ 1500 –ª–µ—Ç. –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω—ã —Ç—Ä–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω—ã, –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏–≤—à–∏–µ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ—Ä—Ç–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ä–æ—Å—Ç —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤: –æ–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ª—å–¥–∞, –æ–±–∏–ª–∏–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–µ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –≤ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ö, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–µ –ø—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–æ–º–µ—Ä–∑–∞—é—â–µ–≥–æ –≤–Ω–æ–≤—å –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–ª–æ—è —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ–∞. –î–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—è –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –ª–µ—Å–æ—Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä—ã –≤ –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–µ –Ω–µ —Å–º–µ—â–∞–ª–∞—Å—å –∫ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä—É –Ω–∞ 400-500 –∫–º. –ë–µ—Ä–µ–∑–æ–≤—ã–µ —Ä–æ—â–∏ —Å –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–∏–º –±–æ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–º –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ —Ä–æ—Å–ª–∏ –≤ —Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–µ –Ω–∞ –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞—Ö - —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ö –∏–∑–æ–ª—è—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ-—Ä–∞–¥–∏–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–∞–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤. | ['fotiev'] | ",['fotiev'],3
368,"The Pembroke Site: Thule Inuit Migrants on Southern Victoria Island | This paper presents description and interpretation of the Pembroke site, the earliest known Thule Inuit occupation in the southeastern Victoria Island region, Nunavut. The site has 11 extant dwellings, including five heavy tent rings, five light semi-subterranean dwellings, and a qalgiq (large communal structure). The site's economy revolved mainly around the acquisition of caribou, Arctic char, and lake trout, with minimal consumption of sea mammals. Radiocarbon dates, reinforced by artifact analyses, indicate an occupation around AD 1400. Based on several lines of evidence, including the extremely small artifact samples, the site is interpreted as having been occupied relatively briefly. It represents the first colonization of the region by Thule people, approximately 200 years after the initial Thule migration from Alaska into the eastern Arctic. Thus, it documents a second migration wave: an expansion of Thule peoples from their initially occupied territories to other, in some ways less optimal, regions. | ['friesen', 'norman'] | ","['friesen', 'norman']",1

Decisive for this opinion is the connection of pediment debris with former ice wedges. Patterned ground, even on steeper slopes, is indicating the predominance of geomorphic stability.

370,"Perspective of landscape change following early settlement (landnam) in Svalbardstunga, northeastern Iceland | A series of peat monoliths was collected from Hjalmarvik, Kuda and Baegistadir, three abandoned farm sites located on a transect extending from the coast to 18 km inland in the Svalbardstunga region (northeastern Iceland) in order to document the impact of human occupation and patterns of land use on landscape change and vegetation. Svalbardstunga is of considerable interest because of the geographical and ecological features that distinguish it from other regions of Iceland, in particular by the more direct influence of the cold East Greenland Current (EGC). Plant and insect macrofossils and diatoms identified in peat monoliths provided proxy indicators of human settlement and land use that in some cases corroborate, and in others expand upon, existing archaeological and historical dates. Based on the presence of ecofacts (calcined bones, fish bones and charcoal), synanthropic insects and some anthropogenic plant-indicators (e.g. weeds), we showed that there was a consistent occupation and use of the coastal site of Hjalmarvik since AD 970. At Kuda, the scenario is quite different. Two periods of occupation or land use were identified: from prior to c. AD 960 to 1190 and from c. AD 1650 to 1870. In the 15th and into the 16th centuries, the decrease in the deposition of traces of fuel wastes around the inland farm sites (Kuda and Baegistadir) suggests that they were used much less frequently. The decline of such proxies for human occupation occurred shortly before the occurrence of the coldest conditions from the 16th to the 17th centuries as well as prior to the V1477 eruption, suggesting that these natural factors may not have been the primary or unique driver of changing modes of tenancy. A scenario of famine-related depopulation would have played a significant role in this decrease in the human impact on vegetation. | ['forbes', 'haemmerli', 'najat', 'natasha', 'pienitz', 'woollett'] | ","['forbes', 'haemmerli', 'najat', 'natasha', 'pienitz', 'woollett']",1

New results from the project ""Settlements of the Bronze Age"" by the Academy of Science and Literature Mainz allow us to now fill part of the remaining gaps in research. Summarizing all available data concerning the plant economy of the Northern European Bronze Age has shown that it constitutes a time of innovation and continuous change. In addition to the omnipresent Triticum dicoccum (emmer) and Hordeum vulgare (barley), this period is marked by the emergence of various new cultivars like T. spelta (spelt) or Camelina sativa (gold-of-pleasure). A comparison between the cereal spectra from several regions in Northern Germany and Scandinavia revealed differences and similarities which allowed for the reconstruction of multiple possible contact zones and various influences from adjacent cultures. Northern Germany and especially Schleswig-Holstein served as an important link for trading over land and by water between the southern areas and Scandinavia. The rising diversity of crop plants in the Late Bronze Age, which is for the first time comparable to the southern regions, reflects the increased trade and therefore stronger influence from beyond the Northern European Bronze Age, which resulted in an accelerated assimilation of innovations and new technologies. | ['effenberger'] | ",['effenberger'],4

375,"The pleistocene colonization and occupation of the Americas | The first migration of humans into the Americas initiated a peopling process that eventually covered over 42 million square kilometers of human occupation spanning high latitude arctic to equatorial environments. As a large-scale demographic and ecological event, the archaeological record provides the only direct evidence of when and how this process unfolded. As reviewed below, key issues concern the timing of paleoclimatic conditions that impacted possible human entry and migratory routes, the location and age of early archaeological sites, and the lifestyle attributes of the colonizing population as interpreted from artifacts. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the Clovis archaeological record as the iconic cultural group widely accepted as evidence of a permanent human presence on the continent. What may have preceded Clovis and the general attributes of immediately subsequent populations are also discussed. Current evidence implies early colonizers quickly established a growing and geographically expanding population with unique technological attributes well-suited to exploring and occupying a vast and changing landscape. It was not until the Late Pleistocene that the Americas, the last of the major land masses to experience human colonization, were first occupied by Paleolithic humans. The initial migrants encountered a landscape dominated by continental ice sheets in the north, altered coastlines, and environments supporting a menagerie of now extinct Pleistocene megafauna. Glaciation during the Pleistocene, the geologic epoch spanning approximately 2.5 million to 13, 000 years ago, resulted in lowered sea levels and exposed continental shelves as terrestrial ice accumulated in massive sheets and glaciers. The landscape was continuously recon figured as climate oscillated between glacial and interglacial events; during glacial periods when colder temperatures led to ice accumulation, a strip of land called Beringia was exposed across what is now the Bering Sea that connected Eurasia to North America. Beringia, or the Bering land bridge, provided the hunting and gathering populations of northeastern Eurasia a direct overland route into the Americas at various times throughout the Pleistocene. ¬© Cambridge University Press 2015. | ['waguespack'] | ",['waguespack'],1

377,"Pollen-based palaeoclimate reconstructions over long glacial-interglacial timescales: Methodological tests based on the Holocene and MIS 5d-c deposits at Sokli, northern Finland | Palaeoclimatic reconstructions over long glacial-interglacial timescales present major methodological challenges, as calibration methods based on modern climate and vegetation patterns may yield biased reconstructions from non-analogue palaeoclimates, such as severely continental glacial periods. In this work, we present pollen-based summer temperature reconstructions based on Holocene and early Weichselian (Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5d-c) deposits at Sokli, northern Finland. We attempt to improve the robustness of reconstructions of continental palaeoclimates by using two calibration sets, with one located in the region surrounding the fossil site and another in a more continental region in northwestern Russia. We assess the reliability of the reconstructions by estimating the compositional fit between fossil and calibration samples and by comparison with independent, plant macrofossil-based reconstructions. We find the fossil samples to fit the extra-regional, high-continentality calibration set better during the early Holocene and MIS 5d-c. Especially in MIS 5d-c, however, even the high-continentality calibration set fits the fossil samples poorly compared to the fit achieved in the mid and late Holocene. Thus our results highlight the problem of finding applicable calibration data for pre-Holocene periods. We finally discuss the relative strengths and vulnerabilities of different calibration methods in reconstruction of non-analogue palaeoclimates. ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | ['birks', 'helmens', 'sakari', 'salonen', 'sepp√§'] | ","['birks', 'helmens', 'sakari', 'salonen', 'sepp√§']",1

Here, we further investigate the Late Pleistocene population dynamics in more detail by combining a powerful algorithm that couples MCMC with coalescent simulations under an approximate Bayesian computation framework. We use an ancient DNA dataset of previously published (n = 34) and new radiocarbon dated specimens (n = 14). Phylogenetic and network analyses based on the mitochondrial control region and the ATP8 gene identified two major haplogroups, one of which appears to vanish around 41,000 cal a BP. The approximate Bayesian computation analysis suggested a decline in effective population size (Ne) in Beringia of at least a 2-fold magnitude that began approximately 47,000 cal a BP, followed by an increase in Ne, most likely around 18,000 cal a BP. The cave lion went through a demographic bottleneck during MIS 3, which may have lasted for several tens of thousands of years, and only recovered shortly before the species' extinction. Several other large mammal species display similar declines in genetic diversity in Beringia during MIS 3, suggesting that major environmental changes might have affected megafaunal populations during this time period. | ['barnes', 'barnett', 'dalen', 'ersmark', 'lister', 'orlando', 'sandoval', 'castellanos', 'stuart'] | ","['barnes', 'barnett', 'dalen', 'ersmark', 'lister', 'orlando', 'sandoval', 'castellanos', 'stuart']",4
380,"Postglacial dispersal and reticulate evolution of nordic coregonids | When the Weichselian ice-sheet withdrew from the Baltic basin, Coregonus species could colonize. The ice-sheet over Finland disintergrated from SE to NW and temporary ice-dammed lakes were formed. They first drained eastwards or northwards, later, when the ice sheet melted, westwards or southwards in the Ancylus Lake, about 9,500 BP. Four species of white-fish, including Coregonus peled and C. pidschian, used these routes and still live sympatrically in northern Sweden. Two came in a first wave, due to the earlier melting of the ice in the SE. They were the only ones to colonize parts of the Indalsalven river, since local obstruction by dead ice blocked the river for the second wave of colonists. Two species of vendace, Coregonus albula and C. trybomi survived, together with probably one whitefish species, in the South Baltic proglacial lakes. Their subsequent penetration northwards was temporarily blocked by the saline Yoldia Sea. Vendace arrived in the northern parts of theAncylus Lake rather late and colonized the lower reaches of the drainages systems. Coregonus lavaretus, an anadromous species, colonized the Baltic area from the SW, via lake Vanern during the Ancylus Lake stage. It is a geographically restricted western species with a late Pleistocene ancestry different from that of the northern quartet of whitefish. A transgression of the Ancylus lake about 9,300-9,200 BP, by some 20 m, eroded two major outlets in the lake Vanern area. The rapids so formed, with a combined water flow of up to 20,000 m3/s and velocity of 5-7 m/s (Bjorck 1995) flushed freshwater fish, including the coregonids, from the Baltic basin into the Kattegat and Skagerack. The sea currents carried these freshwater fish to southeast Norway, Denmark and the rivers on the Swedish west coast. Whitefish and vendace even reached southwest Norway, near Stavanger. During the postglacial period, the coregonids have undergone a reticulate evolution, by introgression between sympatricpopulations. The gene flow has varied according to lake size and the ecological niches occupied. Introgressed populations must be judged as incipient species, being a mixture of genes from several different species. Reticulate evolution by freshwater fish, in numerous isolated populations, could by later reunion result in species flocks. In glaciated areas, the reshuffling factor has been brutal and the species flocks are small, such as the ciscoes of the American Great Lakes. In tropical areas, where isolation and reunion are due to less dramatic water level fluctuations, the species flocks could be larger. The cichlids of African lakes may be an example. | ['svardson'] | ",['svardson'],0
381,"The postglacial Pleistocene of the northern Russian mainland | The paper summarizes the results of recent studies of Late Pleistocene postglacial geological events which occurred in the flatlands of northern Russia stretching from the Timan Ridge to the Laptev Sea coast. The available sedimentary record includes thawed and perennially frozen subaerial sediments and in places lacustrine and fluvial formations. Hundreds of geochronometric measurements by radiocarbon and luminescence techniques place this record within the time span of 50-11 ka BP which confirms an Early-Mid-Weichselian age of the underlying glacial complex first established by the QUEEN programme. The spectrum of proxies includes sedimentary facies, pollen data, plant macrofossils, oxygen isotope values, megafauna remains, insect assemblages, traces of DNA, paleosols and permafrost properties. Together they indicate a continental, progressively deteriorating climate with very cold winters and warmer than present summers through the second half of the Late Pleistocene. Minor climatic fluctuations are largely due to slightly changing humidity during MIS 3. These changes are more pronounced in periglacial European Russia in the vicinity of the Barents-Kara ice sheet where the Mid-Weichselian biotic maximum contrasts with conditions in the Late Weichselian polar desert. In Siberia, the periglacial environments were more stable and beneficial for biota inspite of the increased continentality. The recent data accumulated by various researchers are incompatible with the conventional correlation of the Karginsky interglacial strata of Siberia with MIS 3 or any part of the European Pleniglacial.

383,"Prehistoric maritime adaptations of the subarctic and subantarctic zones: The Aleutian/Fuegian connection reconsidered | In 1975, Allen P. McCartney proposed that Aleutian and Fuegian populations shared a number of common subsistence and technology features, resulting from convergence in adaptation to maritime resources in cold archipelagos. As a result of recent excavations on the north Beagle Channel in Argentine Tierra del Fuego, as well as reconsideration of the historic and ethnographic records, it is now possible to flesh out such a comparative analysis in much greater detail. Both Aleutian and Fuegian populations exploited pinnipeds (sea lions and fur seals) and shellfish (mussels and limpets) in a cold, windy coastal zone, and both regions show an intriguing convergence in the history of subsistence, with a shift from sea mammal hunting to shellfish use occurring around 4,000 years ago. Although differences in resource use (i.e., greater dependence on terrestrial mammals [guanaco] in Tierra del Fuego versus the use of storable anadromous fish in the Aleutians) led to the development of greater sociopolitical complexity among the Aleuts, there is now archaeological evidence to suggest that greater complexity existed in precontact Fuegian populations as well. Most of the differences observed between the groups are probably the result of historical transformations brought about by the depredations of European sealers and whalers beginning in the late eighteenth century. | ['yesner'] | ",['yesner'],1

By comparison with historical records from the time of the Thule Trading Station and the decades following its closure, we reveal a marked variability in resource spaces over time. It is argued that the dynamics of resources and resource spaces in Thule are not underlain by animal distribution and migration patterns, or changes in weather and sea ice conditions alone; but also by economic opportunities, human mobility, settlement patterns, particular historical events and trajectories, and not least by economic and political interests developed outside the region. ¬© 2018, The Author(s). | ['andersen', 'flora', 'gr√∏nnow', 'johansen', 'mosbech'] | ","['andersen', 'flora', 'gr√∏nnow', 'johansen', 'mosbech']",4
387,"The problem of final Palaeolithic in Central Russia | The article should be regarded as an attempt to come out the once formed set of ideas concerning the sites of the final Palaeolithic. The work is based on the revised source base, both of archaeological data and those associated with application of natural sciences. The problem actually consists not so in the absence of final Palaeolithic sites, as in suggesting their incorrect chronology and ungrounded theoretical approach to its solution. Having analysed the data obtained by application of pollen, radiocarbon and geological methods of dating archaeological sites of the Late Pleistocene - the Early Holocene and not numerous dates produced by the methods, the author demonstrates that, when applied to the mineral soils the discussed methods must be seriously corrected, and the majority of the dates do not correspond typologically established age of the archaeological materials. The present methods of collecting pollen samples do not take into consideration quite standard situation of redepositing archaeological materials and pollen remains caused by the phenomenon of the sediments ' pedoturbation. Geological dating is little applied to establish the age of the objects attested to the period in question, and, in the best case, gives grounds to discuss the events of global scale, that is, to attribute sediments to the Pleistocene or Holocene. The environmental conditions during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene provoked not only disappearance of the mammoth fauna, but also conserved fire-places and other organic matters used as samples for radiocarbon dating. Not taking into account specific features of formation of the cultural deposits, their long post-positioned history and the peculiarities of taking samples for dating by the methods of natural science, one finally comes to incorrect conclusions as for the age of the archaeological materials and the gap in the ideas concerning the final Palaeolithic of the discussed region. | ['sorokin'] | ",['sorokin'],1
388,"Problems of Onomastics | The paper deals with the names of geographical objects of Wrangel Island motivated by zoology vocabulary. These lexical units may refer to various species and groups of animals, characteristic features of their appearance and behavior, or include notions and terms of material culture related to hunting, animal breeding, and nature conservation. The study builds on specialized toponymic guides, memoirs and essays, cartographic materials, as well as materials of an interview with the deputy director for environmental protection of the Wrangel Island State Nature Reserve, G. Fedorov. An analysis of the selected material allows us to trace several phases of the island‚Äôs development over the rather short (about 150 years) history of its exploration, captured in toponymy as a major element of spiritual culture. Interestingly enough, a relatively large number (19%) of toponyms are motivated by zoology vocabulary, which is explained by the importance of the animal world for Wrangel Island. Moreover, the choice of specifi c vocabulary from this sphere is associated with the nature of human activity on the island. The island history falls into three periods, each having specifi c source vocabulary for place naming: 1) discovery and initial inspection of the territory; 2) hunting and fi shing development; 3) reserve foundation and environmental activities. The distributional prevalence of motivating tokens speaks not only of the time the name was created or of the nominator‚Äôs occupation but also points to the objective features of the island‚Äôs animal world and the diversity of its fauna. The analysis of the presented data leads to conclude that toponymy serves both as an illustration and as a direct source of unique historical information related to specifi c parts of the studied area. –í —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞–∏–º–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –í—Ä–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—è, –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ–π –∑–æ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä—ã. –í –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä—É—é—â–µ–π –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–∞, –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞—é—â–∞—è –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∏–¥—ã –∏ –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö, –Ω–æ –∏ —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ —á–µ—Ä—Ç—ã –∏—Ö –æ–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–∞ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã, —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π —Å –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω–∏—á—å–∏–º –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—Å–ª–æ–º, –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –∏ –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—ã. –í –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∏, –º–µ–º—É–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∏ –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞, –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –∏ –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è, –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏–∑ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é —Å –∑–∞–º–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º –¥–∏—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –ø–æ –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–∞—é—â–µ–π —Å—Ä–µ–¥—ã –§–ì–ë–£ ¬´–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ ‚Äú–û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –í—Ä–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—è‚Äù¬ª –ì. –Æ. –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—ã–º. –ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –æ—Ç–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–∏—Ç—å —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–æ–≤ –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–º (–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 150 –ª–µ—Ç) –æ—Ç—Ä–µ–∑–∫–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏, –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–º –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ–º —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç–µ –¥—É—Ö–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã, –∫–∞–∫ —Ç–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏—è. –ù–∞ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ–º–æ–π —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–∞–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–±—è –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ (19 % –æ—Ç –æ–±—â–µ–≥–æ —á–∏—Å–ª–∞) —Ç–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–æ–≤, –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–æ–π –∑–æ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä—ã, —á—Ç–æ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∏—Ä–∞ –¥–ª—è –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –í—Ä–∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—è. –ü—Ä–∏ —ç—Ç–æ–º –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–π –ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–∏ –∏–∑ —ç—Ç–æ–π —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä—ã —Ç–µ—Å–Ω–æ —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω —Å —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–º –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ. –í—ã–¥–µ–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è —Ç—Ä–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞: 1) –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ –∏ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏; 2) –æ—Ö–æ—Ç–Ω–∏—á—å–µ-–ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—Å–ª–æ–≤–æ–µ –æ—Å–≤–æ–µ–Ω–∏–µ; 3) –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–æ–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å, - –¥–ª—è –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ –∏–∑ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–µ–Ω –æ—Å–æ–±—ã–π –Ω–∞–±–æ—Ä –ª–µ–∫—Å–∏–∫–∏, –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–µ–º–æ–π –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä—É—é—â–µ–π –¥–ª—è —Ç–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏–∏. –ü—Ä–∏ —ç—Ç–æ–º —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∏—Ä—É—é—â–∏—Ö –ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–º –æ–±—É—Å–ª–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –¥–ª—è –Ω–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ —Ç–æ–≥–æ –∏–ª–∏ –∏–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –±–ª–æ–∫–∞, –Ω–æ –∏ –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–º–∏ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º–∏ –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∏—Ä–∞, —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–µ–º —Ñ–∞—É–Ω—ã –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞. –ù–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥ –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ —Ç–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏—è —Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç –∫–∞–∫ –∏–ª–ª—é—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–æ–º –≤–µ—Å—å–º–∞ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—â–µ–π—Å—è –∫ –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ–º—É —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫—É —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. | ['kostylev'] | ",['kostylev'],3
389,"The Problem of Specialization of Production Activity Population of Western Siberia in Ancient Times | The article is a response to papers by L. N. Mylnikova, I. A. Durakov, T. I. Nokhrina and others about the specialization of production during the Bronze to Iron Age transition period and production of certain types of goods in quantities surpassing the needs of the population of the forest-steppe zone in west Siberia. Many authors regard abundant fish bones that were recovered from Zavialovo-5, a fortified settlement site of the Bronze to Iron Age transition period, as the feature supporting significance of fishing in the economic activities of the population under the impact of the tribes populating forest zones northwards from Zavialovo, or migration of these northern tribes to the south. I. A. Durakov and L. N. Mylnikova have also supported the hypothesis of significance of fishing in the economy of the Zavialovo-5 population and explained this fact by specialization in fishing rather than the links with the cultural traditions of the tribes inhabiting the regions to the north from Zavialovo-5. The hypothesis by I. A. Durakov and L. N. Mylnikova that the Zavialo-vo-5 population exchanged the surplus of fish to products of animal husbandry is criticized by the present author. Correctness of the term specialization with regard to certain types of economic activities during the Bronze to Iron Age transition period is attested. –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º–∞—è —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç–æ–º –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–∏ –õ. –ù. –ú—ã–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–æ–π, –ò. –ê. –î—É—Ä–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞, –¢. –ò. –ù–æ—Ö—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–π –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤, –∑–∞—Ç—Ä–∞–≥–∏–≤–∞—é—â–∏–µ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ª–µ—Å–æ—Å—Ç–µ–ø–Ω–æ–π –∑–æ–Ω—ã –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏ –≤ —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –æ—Ç –±—Ä–æ–Ω–∑–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ–∫–∞ –∫ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–º—É –∏ –ø–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–æ–≤ –≤ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ, –ø—Ä–µ–≤—ã—à–∞—é—â–µ–º –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. –û–±–∏–ª–∏–µ –∫–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π —Ä—ã–±—ã, –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∏ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –æ—Ç –±—Ä–æ–Ω–∑—ã –∫ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑—É –ó–∞–≤—å—è–ª–æ–≤–æ-5, –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–º–∏ –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–º–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–≥–æ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ä—ã–±–æ–ª–æ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø–æ–¥ –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ–º —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω, —Ç–æ—á–Ω–µ–µ, –∏—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ–π –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π –Ω–∞ —é–≥. –ò. –ê. –î—É—Ä–∞–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –õ. –ù. –ú—ã–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞—é—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä—ã–±–æ–ª–æ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –ó–∞–≤—å—è–ª–æ–≤–æ-5, –Ω–æ –æ–±—ä—è—Å–Ω—è—é—Ç —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å–≤—è–∑—å—é —Å –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è–º–∏ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–π, –∞ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä—ã–±–Ω–æ–π –ª–æ–≤–ª–µ. –í —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–µ –ø–æ–¥–≤–µ—Ä–≥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏–∫–µ —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ò. –ê. –î—É—Ä–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∏ –õ. –ù. –ú—ã–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â–∞ –ó–∞–≤—å—è–ª–æ–≤–æ-5 –º–µ–Ω—è–ª–æ –∏–∑–±—ã—Ç–æ–∫ —Ä—ã–±—ã –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç—ã —Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –†–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω–∞ ¬´—Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è¬ª –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –∫ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–º –≤–∏–¥–∞–º –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤ —ç–ø–æ—Ö—É –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –æ—Ç –±—Ä–æ–Ω–∑–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –≤–µ–∫–∞ –∫ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–º—É. | ['troitskaya'] | ",['troitskaya'],3

392,"Pseudo-calliergon turgescens, a fascinating moss in strongly calcareous areas | In northern Europe Pseudo-calliergon turgescens is relatively frequent around the Baltic Sea and in parts of the Scandinavian mountain range. Subfossil finds suggest that the species was formerly more widespread. It is also known from interstadial deposits in northernmost Sweden, where also a number of other mosses that rarely produce sporophytes have been found. This suggests that glacial refugia are not needed to explain its current distribution. In the Baltic area P. turgescens typically grows in strongly calcareous habitats, often in water-filled depressions that dry out in summer. It may also grow on shores and rarely in permanently wet habitats. In the Scandinavian mountain range P. turgescens is found on rocks with periodically trickling water, in shallow calcareous fens, and on brook and lake shores. About 80% of north European specimens of P. turgescens are sterile, whereas only 4% have sporophytes. Relatively more sporophytes have been found in the Baltic area than in the Scandinavian mountains. Together with the high proportion of sterile plants, the low ratio between male and female plants (0.33) can explain the rarity of sporophyte production. The easily detached apical shoot buds, a means of vegetative reproduction, probably partly make up for the low sporophyte production. It is argued that conservation measures for P. turgescens on a European basis will be most cost-effective in the Baltic area, where strong and sporophyte-producing populations of the species are still present. | ['hedenas'] | ",['hedenas'],4

394,"Quantifying hunter-gatherer intensification: a zooarchaeological case study from Arctic Canada | This paper presents the analysis and interpretation of one instance of hunter-gatherer economic intensification, based on three sites in the Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories, Arctic Canada. Quantification of the very well-preserved archaeofaunas from these sites allows a particularly high-resolution analysis of intensification, because faunal resources represent nearly 100% of all food consumed in the region. Exploratory multivariate statistics are applied to the samples, in order to assess the degree to which they vary, and the degree to which faunal variability coincides with chronological relationships among the contexts. The archaeofaunas are then assessed in relation to three component strategies of intensification [after Morrison, K., 1994. The intensification of production: archaeological approaches. Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory 1 (2), 111-159]: ""specialization,"" the economic focus on a narrow range of resources; ""diversification,"" the increasing reliance on a broader range of resources; and ""investment,"" the development of new technologies and procurement strategies. Results indicate that in the Mackenzie Delta case, the economy remained specialized throughout the sequence, but diversification and investment increased during later periods. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

395,"Quantitative Birch (Betula L.) Pollen Separation by Analysis of Size Frequency Data | The Gordon‚ÄîPrentice maximum likelihood method for estimating proportions of morphologically overlapping pollen taxa in a mixture requires knowledge of the underlying frequency distributions. This requirement is hard to fulfil when size is the discriminating character. However, if normality can be assumed the underlying distributions can be inferred from the data. This indirect approach ‚Äê due to Usinger ‚Äê permits reliable separation of Betula species in northwest European pollen diagrams. Techniques for separating mixtures of known distributions and for estimating underlying normal components are compared and assessed. For illustration, birch pollen size data from a Late Weichselian/early Holocene sequence in Finnmark, Norway (H. C. Prentice, unpublished) are subjected to a simple graphical technique to derive (two) normal components and then to the Gordon‚ÄêPrentice method and an analytical least‚Äêsquares method to estimate proportions. The inferred distributions are broadly consistent with Usinger's for Betula nana and Betula pubescens. The results show an Aller√∏d‚ÄêYounger Dryas fall in the pollen percentage of Betula nana, a Betula pubescens rise at the beginning of the Holocene (interpreted as long‚Äêdistance pollen transport), and a subsequent major Betula nana expansion concurrent with the regional Ericales maximum.

396,"Studies in Quaternary entomology: an inordinate fondness for insects | This volume, assembled in honour of the pioneering work of Professor Russell Coope within the field of palaeoentomology, consists of 30 contributions, almost all of which are by former students of Russell, or by scientists greatly influenced by him. It is a mark of the important role that palaeoentomology has had to play in recent palaeoenvironmental research, as well as of the very wide influence that Russell has had in this field, that the contributions are so diverse in scope and application. They range in focus from, for example, the origins of the present and fossil faunas of Greenland, the theory of 'island biogeography', and late Quaternary palaeoclimatology based on quantified temperature estimates, to the interpretation of synanthropic insect faunas preserved on archaeological sites. The geographical scope of the contents of this volume radiates to Antarctica, North America, several small Atlantic islands, Greenland, Africa and Europe. Most of the contributions consider coleopteran assemblages, but there are also articles on Acari, Muscidae, Chironomidae and Hymenoptera. Supplied with the volume, is a disk containing a comprehensive bibliography of scientific publications concerning Quaternary insect assemblages. One of the articles also introduces a versatile, computerised data-base named 'BUGS', which provides comprehensive information on numerous insect fossil records, as well as on the distributions and ecological preferences of much of the North European beetle fauna. | [] | ",,1

The zones form a climatically conditioned succession (from below): the Cassidulina‚ÄêNonion zone contains an arctic fauna affected by meltwater influx, and its deposition was in progress in Late Weichselian; the Uvigerina‚ÄêCassidulina zone with a mixed fauna of arctic and boreal species is referred to the Early Flandrian; the Uvigerina‚ÄêBulimina zone contains a boreal fauna and was deposited under influence of Atlantic water; its age is regarded as Middle and Late Flandrian.

398,"Quaternary geology of the Duck Hawk Bluffs, southwest Banks Island, Arctic Canada: a re-investigation of a critical terrestrial type locality for glacial and interglacial events bordering the Arctic Ocean | Duck Hawk Bluffs, southwest Banks Island, is a primary section (8 km long and 60 m high) in the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago exposing a long record of Quaternary sedimentation adjacent to the Arctic Ocean. A reinvestigation of Duck Hawk Bluffs demonstrates that it is a previously unrecognized thrust-block moraine emplaced from the northeast by Laurentide ice. Previous stratigraphic models of Duck Hawk Bluffs reported a basal unit of preglacial fluvial sand and gravel (Beaufort Fm, forested Arctic), overlain by a succession of three glaciations and at least two interglacials. Our observations dismiss the occurrence of preglacial sediments and amalgamate the entire record into three glacial intervals and one prominent interglacial. The first glacigenic sedimentation is recorded by an ice-contact sandur containing redeposited allochthonous organics previously assigned to the Beaufort Fm. This is overlain by fine-grained sediments with ice wedge pseudomorphs and well-preserved bryophyte assemblages corresponding to an interglacial environment similar to modern. The second glacial interval is recorded by ice-proximal mass flows and marine rhythmites that were glacitectonized when Laurentide ice overrode the site from Amundsen Gulf to the south. Sediments of this interval have been reported to be magnetically reversed (>780 ka). The third interval of glacigenic sedimentation includes glacifluvial sand and gravel recording the arrival of Laurentide ice that overrode the site from the northeast (island interior) depositing a glacitectonite and constructing the thrust block moraine that comprises Duck Hawk Bluffs. Sediments of this interval have been reported to be magnetically normal (<780 ka). The glacitectonite contains a highly deformed melange of pre-existing sediments that were previously assigned to several formally named, marine and interglacial deposits resting in an undeformed sequence. In contrast, the tectonism associated with the thrust block moraine imparted pervasive deformation throughout all underlying units, highlighted by a previously unrecognized raft of Cretaceous bedrock. During this advance, Laurentide ice from the interior of Banks Island coalesced with an ice stream in Amundsen Gulf, depositing the interlobate Sachs Moraine that contains shells as young as similar to 24 cal ka BP (Late Wisconsinan). During deglaciation, meltwater emanating from these separating ice lobes deposited outwash that extended to deglacial marine limit (11 m asl) along the west coast of Banks Island. Our new stratigraphic synthesis fundamentally revises and simplifies the record of past Quaternary environments preserved on southwest Banks Island, which serves as a key terrestrial archive for palaeoenvironmental change.

400,"Radiocarbon chronologies and extinction dynamics of the late Quaternary mammalian megafauna of the Taimyr Peninsula, Russian Federation | This paper presents 75 new radiocarbon dates based on late Quaternary mammal remains recovered from eastern Taimyr Peninsula and adjacent parts of the northern Siberian lowlands, Russian Federation, including specimens of woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), steppe bison (Bison priscus), muskox (Ovibos moschatus), moose (Alces alces), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), horse (Equus caballus) and wolf (Canis lupus). New evidence permits reanalysis of megafaunal extinction dynamics in the Asian high Arctic periphery. Increasingly, radiometric records of individual species show evidence of a gap at or near the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary (PHB). In the past, the PHB gap was regarded as significant only when actually terminal, i.e., when it marked the apparent ""last"" occurrence of a species (e.g., current ""last"" occurrence date for woolly mammoth in mainland Eurasia is 9600 yr BP). However, for high Arctic populations of horses and muskoxen the gap marks an interruption rather than extinction, because their radiocarbon records resume, nearly simultaneously, much later in the Holocene. Taphonomic effects, DELTAC14 flux, and biased sampling are unlikely explanations for these hiatuses. A possible explanation is that the gap is the signature of an event, of unknown nature, that prompted the nearly simultaneous crash of many megafaunal populations in the high Arctic and possibly elsewhere in Eurasia. | ['agenbroad', 'flemming', 'greenwood', 'macphee', 'mol', 'tikhonov', 'de', 'marliave', 'van', 'der', 'plicht'] | ","['agenbroad', 'flemming', 'greenwood', 'macphee', 'mol', 'tikhonov', 'de', 'marliave', 'van', 'der', 'plicht']",4

Pleistocene glacial periods represent extremely unfavorable conditions for the majority of life forms, especially sessile organisms. Many studies have revealed placements of refugial areas and postglacial colonization patterns of seed plants, but little is still known about areas of long-term survival and historical migration routes of bryophytes. Given overall differences in stress tolerance between seed plants and bryophytes, it is of interest to know whether bryophytes have survived periods of extreme climatic conditions better then seed plants in northern areas. | ['flatberg', 'hassel', 'kyrkjeeide', 'stenoien'] | ","['flatberg', 'hassel', 'kyrkjeeide', 'stenoien']",4
403,"Rare and vagrant birds in Iceland: American Wood Warblers | This paper deals with American Wood Warblers (Parulidae) in Iceland. All records until the end of 1995 are included. Altogether 31 records (32 individual birds) comprising 10 species, are listed and discussed. Only 3 of the species have been found in Iceland several times, viz. Northern Parula (Parula americana), Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata) and Blackpoll Warbler (Dendroica striata). The others have been found once or twice, one of them, Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca), only on board a ship in Icelandic waters. One species in category D on the Icelandic list, Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens), is also briefly discussed. The data given for each record, are: locality (place, district, county), number of birds if more than one, date or time period, sex (male = male , female = female ) and age (imm, ad) if known, name of observer(s) or reference, if the record is previously published. Most of the records are confirmed by specimens and preserved as study skins in the Icelandic Institute of Natural History, designated by a RM-catalogue number (RM = Reykjavik Museum), except one in a private collection. Only few records prior to 1979 have been published before, but all records from 1979 onwards have appeared in annual rare bird reports. They are reviewed here. Full information of the records is given in the Icelandic text. The species are as follows: 1. Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia). 2 records: 1 Sept 1970, 19-20 Oct 1991; SW and S Iceland. 2. Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina). 1 record: 14 Oct 1956; found freshly dead in W Iceland. 3. Northern Parula (Parula americana). 7 records: ca. 25 Oct 1913 (found dead), 21 Oct 1948, 28 Oct 1952, 24 Oct 1957, 8 Oct 1962, 27 Sept 1989, 29 Sept 1989; SW and S Iceland. 4. Blackthroated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). 1 record: 14-19 Sept 1988; S Iceland. - Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens). 1 record: 19 Sept 1984. Found dead on board a ship in the Reykjavik harbour. The bird was relatively freshly dead suggesting that it reached Icelandic waters alive, but it is certainly not known when and where it came on board the ship. This species has been placed in a category D on the Icelandic list, which is similar to the British category D. 5. Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca). 1 record: autumn 1987. Found exhausted on board a trawler 40 nautical miles northeast of Horn, NW Iceland. As the trawler had stayed in Icelandic waters for a long time, the bird certainly reached Icelandic territory unassisted. 6. Magnolia Warbler (Dendroica magnolia). 2 records: 29 Sept-7 Dec 1995, 21-23 Oct 1995; SW and S Iceland. 7. Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata). 8 records (9 individuals): 25 Oct 1964, 10 Oct 1976, 11 Oct 1976, 13 Oct 1976, two 26 Oct 1980, 1 Oct 1989, 13 Oct 1991, 25 Sept 1993; SW, S and SE Iceland. 8. Blackpoll Warbler (Dendroica striata). 7 records: 28 Sept 1972, 18 Oct 1974, 24 Oct 1974, 3 Nov 1974, 30-31 Oct 1975, 23 Oct 1979, 7-8 Oct 1995; SW, S and SE Iceland. Six of these records are from the seventies. Interestingly, all 3 birds from 1974 were seen in birdwatchers gardens, indicating that there may have been a major influx of the species in Iceland at the time. 9. American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). 1 record: 10-12 Sept 1975; S Iceland. 10. Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis). 1 record: 29 Sept 1973; found exhausted in SW Iceland. According to the literature, a total of 168 parulids have been found in Europe until the end of 1995 (Table 1). Of these 32 birds (19%) are from Iceland, which is a good share, especially since birdwatchers are relatively few in Iceland. Altogether 21 species have been recorded in Europe. Two of them have only reached Iceland, viz. Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens) and Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis). The distribution of the records in Iceland shows a marked south-southwest pattern, which is not unexpected (Fig. 3). About 28% of the birds (9 of 32) have been found in the Vestmanna Islands off the south coast. Interestingly, most other European records are from relatively small islands, not the mainlands. In Ireland 54% of the parulids are from Cape Clear Island and in Britain 61% are from islands around the country, including 38% from Sicily. The remaining European records are also from islands, five French records are all from Ile d'Ouessant, a single German record from Helgoland, and two from the Faroe Islands. American Wood Warblers have been found in Europe on every day between 24th September and 5th November, except 15th October. They have been present on every day from 5th September to 20th December. Most of the birds (59) have been found during the first two weeks of October (Table 1), and the best days to find a bird seem to be 7th October (9 birds have been recorded), 13th October (8 birds) and 10th October (7 birds). In Greenland 24 parulid species have been recorded. Of these, six have not yet been seen in Europe. These should be expected to show up there sooner or later. These species are Orange-crowned Warbler (Vermivora celata), Nashville Warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), Pine Warbler (Dendroica pinus), Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia) and Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens). | ['olafsson', 'petursson'] | ","['olafsson', 'petursson']",0

405,"A reconsideration of neolithic agriculture in Eastern Norway | The model built up in Denmark by Johs. Iversen and J. Troels-Smith to explain the early Neolithic agriculture is described. This model has also been adopted by Norwegian pollen analysists and archaeologists. It is concluded that ‚Äòthe elm decline‚Äô alone can hardly be used as an argument for the collection of leaf fodder in Eastern Norway. Besides, there is no certain proof of stable feeding of the livestock for the whole year. Animal husbandry was probably the most important form of agriculture in the Early Neolithic period; cereal growing increased in importance in the Late Neolithic and the Bronze Age. One of the main subjects in the article is the different interpretations of charcoal in the pollen cores. Here special references are given to the recent pollen analysis fromTelemark.

406,"Reconstructing caribou seasonal biogeography in Little Ice Age (late Holocene) Western Alaska using intra-tooth strontium and oxygen isotope analysis | The palaeobiogeography of key prey-species can provide valuable insights into animal-human interactions, human subsistence activities and landscape use in the past. In many contemporary indigenous Arctic societies, caribou (Rangifer tarandus spp.) are an important seasonal subsistence species, and recent climatic shifts have influenced the seasonal and spatial distribution and migrations of herds. The impact of larger scale climatic change on this species, such as that experienced during the Little Ice Age (LIA), is not known, but may provide vital clues about future variability. Here we present sequential strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86) and oxygen (delta O-18(CO3)) isotope data from archaeological caribou tooth enamel from Nunalleq, a 15th to 17th century AD pre-contact Yup'ik village site in Western Alaska, to reconstruct caribou movement patterns in this region during the LIA. The results of these analyses highlight variation in ranging habits over the period of time that the site was occupied, and indicate different ranging behaviours in the region in the past compared to modern herds in the area today. The isotopic data presented here complement the wealth of data derived from other research at Nunalleq, illuminating the influence of changing climatic conditions on prey-species palaeoecology and humananimal interactions at the site. | ['britton', 'gigleux', 'grime', 'knecht', 'tutken'] | ","['britton', 'gigleux', 'grime', 'knecht', 'tutken']",1
407,"Reconstructing the ecological history of the extinct harp seal population of the Baltic Sea | The harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), today a subarctic species with breeding populations in the White Sea, around the Jan Mayen Islands and Newfoundland, was a common pinniped species in the Baltic Sea during the mid- and late Holocene. It is puzzling how an ice dependent species could breed in the Baltic Sea during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), and it remains unclear for how long harp seals bred in the Baltic Sea and when the population became extirpated. We combined radiocarbon dating of harp seal bones with zooarchaeological, palaeoenvironmental and stable isotope data to reconstruct the harp seal occurrence in the Baltic Sea. Our study revealed two phases of harp seal presence and verifies that the first colonization and establishment of a local breeding population occurred within the HTM. We suggest that periods with very warm summers but cold winters allowed harp seals to breed on the ice. Human pressure, salinity fluctuations with consequent changes in prey availability and competition for food resources, mainly cod, resulted in physiological stress that ultimately led to a population decline and local extirpation during the first phase. The population reappeared after a long hiatus. Final extinction of the Baltic Sea harp seal coincided with the Medieval Warm Period. Our data provide insights for the first time on the combined effects of past climatic and environmental change and human pressure on seal populations and can contribute with new knowledge on ongoing discussions concerning the impacts of such effects on current arctic seal populations.

408,"Reconstructing the history of a fragmented and heavily exploited red deer population using ancient and contemporary DNA | Background: Red deer (Cervus elaphus) have been an important human resource for millennia, experiencing intensive human influence through habitat alterations, hunting and translocation of animals. In this study we investigate a time series of ancient and contemporary DNA from Norwegian red deer spanning about 7,000 years. Our main aim was to investigate how increasing agricultural land use, hunting pressure and possibly human mediated translocation of animals have affected the genetic diversity on a long-term scale.Results: We obtained mtDNA (D-loop) sequences from 73 ancient specimens. These show higher genetic diversity in ancient compared to extant samples, with the highest diversity preceding the onset of agricultural intensification in the Early Iron Age. Using standard diversity indices, Bayesian skyline plot and approximate Bayesian computation, we detected a population reduction which was more prolonged than, but not as severe as, historic documents indicate. There are signs of substantial changes in haplotype frequencies primarily due to loss of haplotypes through genetic drift. There is no indication of human mediated translocations into the Norwegian population. All the Norwegian sequences show a western European origin, from which the Norwegian lineage diverged approximately 15,000 years ago.Conclusions: Our results provide direct insight into the effects of increasing habitat fragmentation and human hunting pressure on genetic diversity and structure of red deer populations. They also shed light on the northward post-glacial colonisation process of red deer in Europe and suggest increased precision in inferring past demographic events when including both ancient and contemporary DNA. | ['andersen', 'hufthammer', 'roed', 'rosvold', 'stenoien'] | ","['andersen', 'hufthammer', 'roed', 'rosvold', 'stenoien']",1
409,"Regeneration of Little Ice Age bryophytes emerging from a polar glacier with implications of totipotency in extreme environments | Across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, widespread ice retreat during the 20th century has sharply accelerated since 2004. In Sverdrup Pass, central Ellesmere Island, rapid glacier retreat is exposing intact plant communities whose radiocarbon dates demonstrate entombment during the Little Ice Age (1550-1850 AD). The exhumed bryophyte assemblages have exceptional structural integrity (i.e., setae, stem structures, leaf hair points) and have remarkable species richness (60 of 144 extant taxa in Sverdrup Pass). Although the populations are often discolored (blackened), some have developed green stem apices or lateral branches suggesting in vivo regrowth. To test their biological viability, Little Ice Age populations emerging from the ice margin were collected for in vitro growth experiments. Our results include a unique successful regeneration of subglacial bryophytes following 400 y of ice entombment. This finding demonstrates the totipotent capacity of bryophytes, the ability of a cell to dedifferentiate into a meristematic state (analogous to stem cells) and develop a new plant. In polar ecosystems, regrowth of bryophyte tissue buried by ice for 400 y significantly expands our understanding of their role in recolonization of polar landscapes (past or present). Regeneration of subglacial bryophytes broadens the concept of Ice Age refugia, traditionally confined to survival of land plants to sites above and beyond glacier margins. Our results emphasize the unrecognized resilience of bryophytes, which are commonly overlooked vis-a-vis their contribution to the establishment, colonization, and maintenance of polar terrestrial ecosystems. | ['england', 'la', 'farge', 'williams'] | ","['england', 'la', 'farge', 'williams']",1
410,"Reindeer-herding cultures in northern Nordland, Norway: Methods for documenting traces of reindeer herders in the landscape and for dating reindeer-herding activities | This paper focuses on reindeer-herding culture in northern Scandinavia. Reindeer herding concerns the day to day work with the herd on seasonal pastures and on the spring and autumn migrations. The main purpose is to discuss the age of reindeer pastoralism in northern Scandinavia. The transition to a reindeer-herding culture in northern Scandinavia occurred as reindeer came into private ownership, by which means reindeer acquired a new status in society. At the same time a new settlement pattern was established, involving a shift away from watercourses and new landscape elements coming into use. These new areas were the high hills between the rivers. In following the reindeer, people established new settlements in the reindeer pastures. At the same time, new types of physical features were established in the same areas, such as milking places ""(gieddi)"" and bone deposits. In Hamaroy municipality there is a large number of documented physical cultural remains related to reindeer pastoralism. These are hearths, places where reindeer were milked, and bone deposits that have been dated from the end of the late Iron Age, through the medieval period and to recent times. It is argued that they can be linked to a transition from a hunter-gatherer society to pastoralism, a change that can be dated back to the transition between the Iron Age and the Middle Ages, with the initial phase apparently dating from the end of the late Iron Age. This is a pattern that coincides with similar surveys in other areas, such as on the Swedish side of the Norwegian border. It is argued therefore that the transition to reindeer pastoralism occurred at this time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved. | ['andersen'] | ",['andersen'],4

412,"Reply to formal comment on Griffiths et al. (2017) submitted by Gajewski (2020) | Gajewski offers a formal comment on Griffiths et al. (2017), a paper that explored how microclimates and their varying ice cover regimes on lakes and ponds in Arctic regions modified the diatom assemblage responses to recent warming. One of Gajewski's main criticisms is that the microclimate classification scheme used in Griffiths et al. (2017) is merely anecdotal; a claim which ignores the value of observational evidence and misunderstands the frequency that each site was visited or surveyed. We clarify that the study sites were visited multiple times via recurrent aerial surveys and ground observations dating back to the 1970s, which supports our microclimate classification scheme. Many of Gajewski's claims regarding climate, catchment characteristics, and ice melting properties from field locations he has not visited were refuted by veteran Arctic scientists with long-term field experience in these regions. In addition, Gajewski makes several criticisms concerning radioisotopic dating, core chronology, sediment mixing, diagenesis, and preservation of bioindicators that relate more to general paleolimnological assumptions than to conclusions reached by Griffiths et al. (2017). Research from the 1980s and 1990s, when scientific consensus on these issues was first reached, readily show that the methodologies and data interpretation of Griffiths et al. (2017) are sound. We appreciate the opportunity to expound on the finer details of the Griffiths et al. (2017) paper, work based on field research by the study's co-authors spanning almost three decades, with additional observations from colleagues dating back to the 1970s.

414,"A review of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) stock identity | For management purposes, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission has considered bowhead whales as having five stocks (geographically distinct segments of the population): Spitsbergen, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, Okhotsk Sea and Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (B-C-B). These divisions are defined primarily by known distribution and seasonal movements. Historically, bowhead whales had a circumarctic distribution, with several periods of range expansion and contraction depending upon access through Arctic straits. Heavy exploitation by pre-20th century commercial whalers reduced bowhead whale abundance, further segregating stocks. A portion of the B-C-B stock escaped whalers by migrating into the pack ice each spring and summering in the Beaufort Sea. Few bowhead whales are now found in the summer in the Chukchi or Bering Seas. The distribution of this species should be considered labile, affected by sea ice and availability of prey, a factor that improves the likelihood of genetic mixing between stocks. Genetic variability has remained relatively high in spite of the severe depletion of the population, and there is no evidence of any recent genetic bottleneck. Besides geographic distribution and genetics, stock identity may be studied via morphological differences, reidentification of individuals between different stock areas, acoustic signatures, pollutant burdens, parasites and predators, feeding ecology and conception dates. Harpoon heads, research tags and lens racemisation indicate that bowhead whales are long-lived, can travel over large areas and may mix among stocks. Because conception occurs during or near the time of the spring migration, there are opportunities for genetic mixing among whales that might use different summering areas. | ['breiwick', 'demaster', 'moore', 'rooney', 'rugh', 'shelden'] | ","['breiwick', 'demaster', 'moore', 'rooney', 'rugh', 'shelden']",4

Bien que la tendance generale des changements dans la vegetation soit semblable aux donnees publiees anterieurement pour l'etang Antifreeze, notre nouvelle analyse indique que le moment des principaux changements de vegetation est substantiellement different, surtout au cours des periodes tardiglaciaires et de l'Holocene precoce (similar to 17 000 - 9000 annees cal. avant le present). Les donnees originales pour l'etang Antifreeze devaient couvrir un interstade au Wisconsinien moyen (> 30 000 annees cal. avant le present) et toute la periode glaciaire. Nos resultats indiquent toutefois que le materiel d'age Wisconsinien moyen a probablement ete depose par effondrement autour de l'etang, rendant difficile l'interpretation du paleoenvironnement.

417,"Rock Glacier Types and Their Drainage Systems Grizzly Creek Yukon Territory Canada | Moraine rock glaciers, talus-derived rock glaciers and avalanche rock glaciers are described from Grizzly Creek [Canada]. The main moraine rock glacier has a number of flow lobes of different ages as indicated by lichen and vegetation development. On many of these surfaces there is evidence for recent movement in the form of overridden vegetation surfaces and unstable frontal slopes. Meltwater drainage through the landform is slow, allowing precipitation of the suspended sediment load, and as resurgences do not occur for all of the inflow the possibilities of addition to the ice core or drainage below Grizzly Creek gravels are discussed. The talus-derived rock glaciers differ morphologically from the moraine forms with far greater complexity of the flow ridges but with fewer flow episodes indicated. Drainage through these forms is slow and variable and indicates percolation of meltwater over an impermeable surface within the form. Avalanche rock glaciers by contrast are relatively simple morphologically and the extension from the base of the talus is attributed to ice content derived from the avalanches. | ['johnson'] | ",['johnson'],0

420,"The Saami between East and West in the Middle Ages: An archaeological contribution to the history of reindeer breeding | When did pastoral reindeer breeding emerge out of utilizing the reindeer as a decoy and means of transport? Where? Under what circumstances? Why was this form of economy significant for Saami communities which belonged to the Swedish trade network and not to the contemporary Danish-Norwegian or Russian ones? The problem is illuminated here using social anthropological theory and historical-archaeological evidence. Prerequisites for nomadism are economic reserves, e.g. silver, and regular contact with other economies. Thus, the Saami's silver accumulation, monetization and emerging external economical networks in the north are considered relevant to the problem, as well as ancient remains that surely represent pastoral reindeer breeding or new ways of using the environment. Pite and/or Lule√• lappmark and adjacent parts of northern Norway are probably where reindeer pastoralism emerged. It seems to be of late medieval origin (15th century?), though its expansion principally is post-medieval. The economic network established by the Swedish Crown in the Gulf of Bothnia in the 14th century, with the so-called bircarlians (Sw. birkarlar) as middlemen in contacts with the interior parts of northern Fennoscandia, appears to have been of principal importance. This network was rendered more effective from the 17th century onward, a time when reindeer pastoralism became more and more significant. The article also illuminates how a group in the periphery came to be important for the territorial definition of states, in this case Sweden, Denmark-Norway and Russia, and how opportunities for royal governance were created.

In this study we analyzed trees with bark-peelings in a nature reserve in northernmost Sweden to assess the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of inner-bark harvesting. We found that the same inner-bark harvest locale was used repeatedly, in nearly every decade from the late 16th to the late 19th century and that harvest levels varied greatly over time. The harvest levels we observed were surprisingly low, in comparison to levels suggested in other studies, and indicate that inner-bark was used as a supplementary health food during early spring when game meat was naturally lean, rather than being used as bulk food year-round. | ['josefsson', 'ostlund', 'rautio'] | ","['josefsson', 'ostlund', 'rautio']",0

The artefacts consisted of asbestos-tempered ceramics, soapstone vessels and a fragment of a soapstone mould for casting a socketed axe. Burnt animal bones recovered from a fireplace indicate the presence of domesticated animals in the form of sheep or goat. Also fragments of seal and fish bones were uncovered, and seen in connection with the find of a fishing sinker a strictly agrarian economy is out of the question. 14C-dating indicates a main habitation phase between c 1000-800 BC, a date also supported by the artefact material as well as the construction type of the building. The site mirrors the only other Late Bronze Age house in northern Norway as well as settlements further south. The Sandvika locality also sheds new light on the so-called drift sand sites found on the northern Norwegian coast. It is suggested that these sites have been of the same type as the one in Sandvika. Nonetheless, it is highlighted that this settlement hardly can be understood as a mirror image of what is found further south, and that it must be understood in light of its local and regional setting. | ['arntzen'] | ",['arntzen'],4
424,"Using satellite image analysis for locating prehistoric archaeological sites in Alaska's Central Brooks Range | In this pilot study, we apply satellite image analysis to archaeological site prospection in Alaska's Brooks Range. Our goal was to test whether satellite remote sensing, which has been successful in locating large archaeological features associated with sedentary peoples, could be applied to arctic interior sites associated with mobile hunter-gatherers. In particular, we strove to develop a relatively straightforward and inexpensive model using existing data which could be used to help guide archaeology surveys. Using 1-m resolution IKONOS imagery of Lake Matcharak along the upper Noatak River, we produced a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tasseled cap transformation of the study area and stacked these five vegetation indices into one image. We then applied unsupervised and supervised classifications to the image first, to test for the presence of a site-specific spectral class and second, determine the nature of that class. Through a visual analysis of the unsupervised classification, a spectral phenomenon was seen to co-occur with archaeological sites in the study area. The supervised classification provided a high-resolution land cover map used to identify the signature as the ecotone between un-vegetated sediments and dense willow (Salix sp.) stands. Dense willow stands along the Lake Matcharak shore visually correlate with most of the known archaeological sites, possibly reflecting landform and/or vegetation characteristics that would have appealed to past inhabitants.

Genetic research has recently led to the ‚ÄòBeringian standstill hypothesis‚Äô (BSH), which suggests an isolated group of humans lived somewhere in Beringia for millennia during the Last Glacial, before a subgroup migrated southward into the American continents about 14 ka. Recently published organic geochemical data suggest human presence around Lake E5 on the Alaskan North Slope during the Last Glacial; however, these biomarker proxies, namely faecal sterols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are relatively novel and require replication to bolster their support of the BSH.

This early date is also in conflict with the dating results on extensive series of short-lived material such as grain and domestic animal and human bone remains of early settlers.

This study uses a Bayesian model, implemented in the OxCal program, to show that the charcoal data combined with short-lived material (grain/bone) suggest ages anywhere in the interval AD 854-922 (95.4% probability), indicating that the available 14C data cannot be taken as compelling evidence that there was a settlement any earlier than AD 922.

428,"Shieling activity in the Norse Eastern Settlement: Palaeoenvironment of the 'Mountain Farm', Vatnahverfi, Greenland | Transhumance agriculture formed a key component of subsistence strategies in the Norse economies of the North Atlantic, with evidence of shielings or saeters found in Norway, Scotland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland. It is frequently assumed to have played a role in Norse Greenland, yet little enquiry has been made into such activity. This paper seeks to address this deficit, presenting the first palaeoenvironmental study of a suspected Greenlandic shieling site in the uplands of the former Norse Eastern Settlement. Pollen analysis, C-14 and associated proxies are used to date and assess the environmental and landscape impact of shieling activity. Evidence for vegetation disturbance associated with Norse settlement is indicated from c. ad 985, but the shieling itself is interpreted as having been established somewhat later (cal. AD 1050-1150). Initially the site appears to have been used exclusively for grazing of livestock and there is tentative evidence for the use of burning to stimulate the spread of pastures. Pollen influx figures suggest the intensification, or initiation, of hay production c. cal. 1225-1325 reflecting either the spread of settlement from the lowland valleys, or evolution of the site into a full farm in response to population pressure. A reduction of human impact cal. AD 1300-1390 suggests a reversion to shieling activity, indicating similarities to transhumance in northern Iceland. Abandonment of the site dates to cal.

Except in cases of exceptional endogenous DNA preservation, most of the sequences isolated from fossil material do not originate from the specimen of interest, but instead reflect environmental organisms that colonized the specimen after death. Here, we characterize the microbial diversity recovered from seven c. 200- to 13000-year-old horse bones collected from northern Siberia. We use a robust, taxonomy-based assignment approach to identify the microorganisms present in ancient DNA extracts and quantify their relative abundance. Our results suggest that molecular preservation niches exist within ancient samples that can potentially be used to characterize the environments from which the remains are recovered. In addition, microbial community profiling of the seven specimens revealed site-specific environmental signatures. These microbial communities appear to comprise mainly organisms that colonized the fossils recently. Our approach significantly extends the amount of useful data that can be recovered from ancient specimens using a shotgun sequencing approach.

431,"The significance of high-boreal to subarctic maerl deposits in northern Norway to reconstruct holocene climatic changes and sea level oscillations | This paper describes (i) the Recent distribution pattern of various types of carbonate sediments in Troms county (northern Norway), and (ii) the onset of carbonate sedimentation after the final deglaciation of the Fennoscandian ice-shield. The distribution of major facies belts is strongly dependent on hydrographic and topographic constraints. The main bulk of carbonate deposits is derived from maerl-producing coralline algal biotopes that are restricted to the photic zone of waveprotected areas and influenced by tidal currents. Furthermore, extended mollusc and echinoderm-rich arenites are present in the area investigated. In deeper subtidal areas, terrigenous sediments of Late Weichselian to Early Holocene age are preserved. However, these are strongly influenced by later winnowing processes, generating a coquina lag deposit that serves as a secondary hardground for a diverse fouling community. The Holocene facies successions can be seen in several raised outcrops, containing the transition from glacigenic to Recent non-glacigenic depositional conditions. Autochthonous radiocarbon dated rhodolith banks, which mark the onset of carbonate sedimentation, yielded surprisingly young ages of 5,500 YBP. Around 5,500 YBP, present-day oceanographic and climatic conditions had already been firmly established. This time-lag can be explained with the behaviour of postglacial sea level fluctuations in the area. From 10,000 their cooperation in this project.

432,"Silvicultural and Dendroclimatic Analysis of Plantations Gmelin Larch Western Part of the Putoran Plateau | High-latitude regions of the northern hemisphere are of considerable interest for the assessment of natural and anthropogenic changes in air temperature, growth and productivity of tundra ecosystems. The results of the silvicultural analysis of characteristics and condition of Gmelin larch stands and other components phytocoenosis in various site conditions: Larch sphagnum-ledum (slopes of the northern and southern exposure) and Larch alder (intermontane site) in the upper reaches of Lama lake (Putorana plateau). In the surveyed stands dominated by trees 150-200 years old. Plantings on the northern slopes are in satisfactory sanitary condition, stable, perform basic environmental functions. Sanitary condition of stands on the slopes of southern exposure - is not satisfactory. Larch stands in the intermountain site characterized by best sanitary conditions and productivity. The results of dendrochronological and dendroclimatic analysis of radial increment stands of Gmelin larch. Revealed a sharp increase in the number of extrema larch radial increment in the last 50 years. The sharp increase in the amplitude and frequency of vibrations in the increment of larch since the end of 1960, some increase of increment in this period, as evidenced by the growth of the instability of climatic conditions, and the impact on forest ecosystems of Putorana plateau emissions of Norilsk metallurgical Combine. The maximum air temperature and precipitation total for the year, obviously, are the determining factors in the formation of the annual increment by diameter Gmelin larch in the Putorana mountains. –í—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ—à–∏—Ä–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω—ã —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–ª—É—à–∞—Ä–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è—é—Ç –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å –¥–ª—è –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–∏ –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –∞–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–π —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –≤–æ–∑–¥—É—Ö–∞, —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ª–µ—Å–æ—Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º. –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –ª–µ—Å–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ —Ç–∞–∫—Å–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫ –∏ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏—è –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ–≤ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ì–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤ —Ñ–∏—Ç–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–æ–∑–∞ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–µ—Å–æ—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö: –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤—è–≥ –±–∞–≥—É–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ-—Å—Ñ–∞–≥–Ω–æ–≤—ã–π (—Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω—ã —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –∏ —é–∂–Ω–æ–π —ç–∫—Å–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏–∏) –∏ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤—è–≥ –æ–ª—å—Ö–æ–≤—ã–π (–º–µ–∂–≥–æ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Ä–∞—Å–ø–∞–¥–æ–∫) –≤ –≤–µ—Ä—Ö–æ–≤—å—è—Ö –æ–∑–µ—Ä–∞ –õ–∞–º–∞ (–ø–ª–∞—Ç–æ –ü—É—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞). –í –æ–±—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å—è 150-200-–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–≥–æ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞. –ù–∞—Å–∞–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–∞—Ö —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π —ç–∫—Å–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥—è—Ç—Å—è –≤ —É–¥–æ–≤–ª–µ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–º —Å–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–º —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–∏, —É—Å—Ç–æ–π—á–∏–≤—ã, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è—é—Ç –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—É—é—â–∏–µ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏. –°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ–≤ –Ω–∞ —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–∞—Ö —é–∂–Ω–æ–π —ç–∫—Å–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ü–∏–∏ - –Ω–µ—É–¥–æ–≤–ª–µ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ. –î—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∏ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –≤ –º–µ–∂–≥–æ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞—Å–ø–∞–¥–∫–∞—Ö –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞–∏–ª—É—á—à–∏–º —Å–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–º —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ–º –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é. –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –¥–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ –¥–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ–≤ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ì–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω–∞. –í—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ —Ä–µ–∑–∫–æ–µ —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–∞ —ç–∫—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º—É–º–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –≤ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–µ–º 50-–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–µ–º –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–µ. –†–µ–∑–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∞–º–ø–ª–∏—Ç—É–¥—ã –∏ —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ—Ç—ã –∫–æ–ª–µ–±–∞–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –≤ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–µ 40-45 –ª–µ—Ç (—Å –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞ 1960-—Ö –≥–≥.), –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —É–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –≤ —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥, —Å–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç –∫–∞–∫ –æ —Ä–æ—Å—Ç–µ –Ω–µ—Å—Ç–∞–±–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏–π, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –æ –≤–æ–∑–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ –ª–µ—Å–Ω—ã–µ —ç–∫–æ—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –ø–ª–∞—Ç–æ –ü—É—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –≤—ã–±—Ä–æ—Å–æ–≤ –ù–æ—Ä–∏–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–µ—Ç–∞–ª–ª—É—Ä–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ç–∞. –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã –≤–æ–∑–¥—É—Ö–∞ –∏ —Å—É–º–º–∞ –æ—Å–∞–¥–∫–æ–≤ –∑–∞ –≥–æ–¥, –æ—á–µ–≤–∏–¥–Ω–æ, —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è—é—â–∏–º–∏ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–º–∏ –≤ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≥–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –ø–æ –¥–∏–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—É –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ì–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –≤ –≥–æ—Ä–∞—Ö –ü—É—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–∞. | ['gupalov', 'matveev'] | ","['gupalov', 'matveev']",3
433,"In situ cryo-subfossil vegetation in northwest Greenland | A subfossil vegetation about 1300-1400 years old and undisturbed by glacial movements was found along the retreating ice-cap north of Qaanaaq, North Greenland. The lichens and lichenicolous fungi seem to have been alive at the time of ice-covering. 45 species of lichens and 6 of lichenicolous fungi were found. The flora resembles the recent flora of snowbeds in the area. An encrusted tube was seen in the ascustop of Skyttea cfr. fusipora, and ascoconidia were formed by Porpidia crustulata. Otherwise the species seem quite normal, many still reacted to chemicals traditionally used for identifications, but some were damaged by running melt-water. | ['alstrup'] | ",['alstrup'],1
434,"Six-legged Hitchhikers: An Archaeobiogeographical Account of the Early Dispersal of Grain Beetles | Grain-associated insect species are economically important and archaeologically significant. Their dispersal around the globe and eventually across the North Atlantic region surely occurred through human transport rather than naturally. Most beetle cereal pests are now nearly cosmopolitan in their distribution, but their prehistoric ranges appear to have been more restricted. What is known or surmised of the early dispersal of these insect species is summarized, and the role of archaeobiogeographical data in investigating past human contact evaluated. Analysis of fossil and historic records of grain-associated beetles suggests that their dispersal corresponded with assumptions concerning human movement and interaction in the past. There is a significant fossil record for some grain beetles, but it is incomplete and predominantly from northwest Europe. More fossils are needed from across the Palaearctic and North Africa. The examination of pre-agricultural natural deposits in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent might reveal the original ranges of the pest species, the stages by which they entered into association with humans, and their earliest dispersal. With a more complete fossil record, the grain fauna may provide a useful proxy by which to evaluate cultural contact and human migration into the North Atlantic region in the past. | ['kenward', 'king', 'schmidt', 'smith'] | ","['kenward', 'king', 'schmidt', 'smith']",1
435,"Soils –æf Oligo-Mesotrophic –∞nd Mesotrophic Mires –æf the Boreal Belt of West Siberia: Possibilities of Botanical Diagnostics within the Frameworkof Peat Mesotrophic Soil Type | Despite the widespread use of the taxon ‚Äúmesotrophic (transitional) peat soils‚Äù in the present-day Russian and foreign soil science, including some fundamental publications in this field, its diagnostic features are still uncertain, and this taxon is not included in the recent classification of Russian soils. The proposed criteria based on botanical features - botanical composition of peat soils and indicative plants - will allow separating mesotrophic type from eutrophic and oligotrophic types of peat soils. Special attention is paid to the issue of distinction between peat mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils in accordance with the specific features of mires in northern West Siberia. Of the 32 studied profiles in the Numto Nature Park, 19 soils were mamed peat mesotrophic and 13 profiles - peat oligotrophic. Owing to the spatial and temporal d-ynamics of vegetation in large- and flat-mound palsa complexes, the soils of their hollows were in most cases assigned to the oligotrophic type. The soils of aapa mires, as well as mires on low alluvial terraces, in river floodplains and in runoff depressions of the dissected slopes of Siberian Uvaly upland are classified mainly as peat mesotrophic soils. –ù–µ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä—è –Ω–∞ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–∞–∫—Å–æ–Ω–∞ ‚Äú–º–µ–∑–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã–µ (–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ) —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—á–≤—ã‚Äù –≤ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–º –∏ –∑–∞—Ä—É–±–µ–∂–Ω–æ–º –ø–æ—á–≤–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏, –≤ —Ç–æ–º —á–∏—Å–ª–µ –≤ —Ä—è–¥–µ —Ñ—É–Ω–¥–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π –≤ —ç—Ç–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏, –µ–≥–æ –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–∫–∏ –¥–æ —Å–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ä –æ—Å—Ç–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ–æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏, –∞ –≤ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ø–æ—á–≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ —ç—Ç–æ—Ç —Ç–∞–∫—Å–æ–Ω –Ω–µ –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è. –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º—ã–µ –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∏, –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–∞ –≥–µ–æ–±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–∫–∞—Ö - –±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–µ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—á–≤ –∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö-–∏–Ω–¥–∏–∫–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—Ö - –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è—Ç –æ–±–æ—Å–æ–±–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ—á–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ç–∏–ø –º–µ–∑–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Ç —ç–≤—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –æ–ª–∏–≥–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≤ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—á–≤. –û—Å–æ–±–æ–µ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ —É–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–æ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É —Ä–∞–∑–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ–∑–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã—Ö –∏ –æ–ª–∏–≥–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–æ—á–≤ –≤ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–∏ —Å–æ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–æ–π –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–∞ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏. –ò–∑ 32-—Ö –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª–µ–π –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–∞—Ä–∫–∞ –ù—É–º—Ç–æ 19 –ø–æ—á–≤ –±—ã–ª–∏ –¥–∏–∞–≥–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –∫–∞–∫ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã–µ –º–µ–∑–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã–µ –∏ 13 - –∫–∞–∫ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã–µ –æ–ª–∏–≥–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã–µ. –ò–∑-–∑–∞ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–æ- –∏ –ø–ª–æ—Å–∫–æ–±—É–≥—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—ã—Ö –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–æ–≤ –ø–æ—á–≤—ã –º–æ—á–∞–∂–∏–Ω –≤ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ —Å–ª—É—á–∞–µ–≤ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ—Ç–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω—ã –∫ –æ–ª–∏–≥–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω–æ–º—É —Ç–∏–ø—É. –ü–æ—á–≤—ã –∞–∞–ø–∞ –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç –Ω–∞ –Ω–∏–∑–∫–∏—Ö –∞–ª–ª—é–≤–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∞—Å–∞—Ö, –≤ –ø–æ–π–º–∞—Ö —Ä–µ–∫ –∏ –≤ –ª–æ–∂–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ö —Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—á–ª–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–∫–ª–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –°–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ö –£–≤–∞–ª–æ–≤ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –≤ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–º –∫–∞–∫ –º–µ–∑–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã–µ. | ['avetov', 'kuznetsov', 'shishkonakova'] | ","['avetov', 'kuznetsov', 'shishkonakova']",3
436,"Spatiotemporal analyses suggest the role of glacial history and the ice-free corridor in shaping American badger population genetic variation | Recurring glacial cycles through the Quaternary period drastically altered the size and distribution of natural populations of North American flora and fauna. The ""southerly refugia model"" has been the longstanding framework for testing the effects of glaciation on contemporary genetic patterns; however, insights from ancient DNA have contributed to the reconstruction of more complex histories for some species. The American badger,Taxidea taxus, provides an interesting species for exploring the genetic legacy of glacial history, having been hypothesized to have postglacially emerged from a single, southerly refugium to recolonize northern latitudes. However, previous studies have lacked genetic sampling from areas where distinct glacial refugia have been hypothesized, including the Pacific Northwest and American Far North (Yukon, Alaska). In order to further investigate the phylogeographic history of American badgers, we collected mitochondrial DNA sequence data from ancient subfossil material collected within the historical range (Alaska, Yukon) and combined them with new and previously published data from across the species' contemporary distribution (n = 1,207). We reconstructed a mostly unresolved phylogenetic tree and star-like haplotype network indicative of emergence from a largely panmictic glacial refugium and recent population expansion, the latter further punctuated by significantly negative Tajima'sDand Fu'sFsvalues. Although directionality of migration cannot be unequivocally inferred, the moderate to high levels of genetic variation exhibited by American badgers, alongside the low frequency of haplotypes with indels in the Midwest, suggest a potential recolonization into central North America after the hypothesized ice-free corridor reopened ~13,000 years ago. Overall, the expanded reconstruction of phylogeographic history of American badgers offers a broader understanding of contemporary range-wide patterns and identifies unique genetic units that can likely be used to inform conservation of at-risk populations at the northern periphery. | ['cornellas', 'ford', 'leonard', 'russello', 'weir'] | ","['cornellas', 'ford', 'leonard', 'russello', 'weir']",1

439,"St. Matthew Island colonized through multiple long-distance red fox (Vulpes vulpes) dispersal events | Expansion of red fox (Vulpes vulpes (L., 1758)) into new arctic habitat and the potential for competition with arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus (L., 1758)) are of considerable conservation concern. Previous work has focused on red fox expanding into contiguous areas with few barriers to dispersal. Here, we examine mitochondrial DNA in red fox on recently colonized St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea to determine their ultimate origin. Though limited in sample size (n = 7), we found that St. Matthew Island was colonized by North American lineages; surprisingly, despite the >400 km distance to the mainland, we found the island was colonized by at least three mitochondrial matrilines. These results suggest that even extremely isolated places may be colonized by red fox, and that the over-ice or over-ocean dispersal ability of red fox may have been previously underappreciated. | ['colson', 'hundertmark', 'smith'] | ","['colson', 'hundertmark', 'smith']",4

441,"Stable isotope chemistry, population histories and Late Prehistoric subsistence change in the Aleutian Islands | Aleut population history has been a topic of debate since the earliest archaeological investigations in the region. In this paper, we use stable isotope chemistry to evaluate the hypothesis that two distinct groups of people, Paleo- and Neo-Aleut, occupied the eastern Aleutians after 1000. BP. This study focuses on 80 sets of directly dated eastern Aleutian burial assemblages from Chaluka midden, Shiprock Island and Kagamil Island. We use a linear mixing model informed by isotopic analysis of two large Aleut faunal assemblages to address temporal and spatial variation in human carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from these sites. The patterning we report addresses both Aleut demographic and economic prehistory, illustrating a transition in both at ca. 1000. BP. Our results suggests that the Chaluka diet, dominated by Paleo-Aleut inhumations, differed in both trophic level and foraging location from the other two sites for much of the past 4000 years. Trends in our data also suggest that individuals from Shiprock and Kagamil burial caves, primarily Neo-Aleuts, had enough access to higher trophic level foods to differentiate their bone chemistries from those buried in Chaluka midden. These trends in diet, recently reported genetic differences, as well as the introduction of novel mortuary practices at ca. 1000. BP, suggest that Neo-Aleuts do represent a population new to the eastern Aleutians. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. | ['broughton', 'byers', 'coltrain', 'yesner'] | ","['broughton', 'byers', 'coltrain', 'yesner']",1

444,"Stone Age rock art and beluga landscapes at River Vyg, north-western Russia | One of the largest concentrations of Stone Age rock art in northern Europe is situated at the estuary of River Vyg by the White Sea, north-western Russia, where more than 2300 figures have been recorded. A unique feature of the Vyg rock art are the numerous whale hunting scenes. The rock art is dated to between 5300 and 2000 BC, although the dating is controversial. This paper focuses on how rock art interacts with the landscape on different levels. Through a series of case studies, it is shown how natural features are intertwined with rock art, and how the places themselves might reveal why the figures or scenes are positioned in the way they are. The paper relates the rock art to the micro-landscape and the macro-landscape of the River Vyg area. Ethnographic sources are applied to shed light to the prehistoric landscapes and the whale hunting in particular. These suggest that whale hunting at River Vyg included rituals and communication between people, animals and the spirits. The making of rock art, or telling stories, may have been a central part of this communication. | ['gjerde'] | ",['gjerde'],4
445,"Stratigraphic interpretation of rare earth element signatures in Pleistocene mammal bones: A case study from Kharabai site, East Siberia | A significant portion of the Quaternary mammal remains is not found in situ, which limits their biostratigraphic potential and the possibility of studying evolutionary changes. To determine stratigraphic position of such finds we used the geochemical interpretations of rare earth element relative concentrations and fractionations (REE signatures) in the faunal remains and surrounding sediments. REE signatures vary between different profile deposits due to differences in deposit sources, conditions, and REE fractionation during deposition and diagenesis. Redeposited faunal remains can retain evidence of unique REE signatures of surrounding deposits, which allows assigning such bones to their proper depositional units. This method is tested here on the material from the Kharabai site, Viluy River, Central Yakutia (63.77 [degree]N, 121.10 [degree]E). We determined that the REE signatures from the faunal remains, collected at the base of the exposure, showed a statistically significant correspondence to certain stratigraphic layers, indicating the original deposition location of these remains. Importantly, the biochronological age of the mammals, determined using their evolutionary position, was consistent with the stratigraphic position of the layers, with which they were associated using the REE signatures. This research suggests that the lower layers of the Kharabai site date to Early Middle Pleistocene, while the upper ones date to Late Pleistocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

447,"Subfossil Records of the Arctic Fox (Alopex-Lagopus) Compared to Its Present Distribution in Norway | We studied the prehistoric and historic distributions of arctic foxes in Norway by examining material and reports from archaeological excavations. A total of 44 arctic fox bones were found in 15 excavations, all of which were younger than 5000 years before present (B.P.). The majority of these sites was located within or close to the present distribution of arctic foxes. Additionally, 44 naturally deposited arctic fox bones were found in two excavations dated 36 000-28 000 and 13 000 B.P. respectively, indicating that the arctic fox also lived along the Norwegian coast in the Pleistocene. No arctic fox bone was dated to the period 9000-5000 B.P., and the species may have been rare or absent during this comparatively warm period. Since most bones (61%) were from the distal part of the limbs, the foxes may have been skinned elsewhere and transported to the site of deposition. Bones from red foxes were found in three excavations within the present distribution of arctic foxes, indicating that the arctic fox was relatively more abundant than red foxes during the late prehistoric and the historic periods in south Norway, but less abundant in north Norway. | ['frafjord', 'hufthammer'] | ","['frafjord', 'hufthammer']",1
448,"Subsistence Practices of Pioneering Thule-Inuit: A Faunal Analysis of Tiktalik | This paper examines faunal material from Tiktalik (NkRi-3), an early Thule-Inuit site on the southern coast of Amundsen Gulf, Northwest Territories. This region was the gateway through which Thule-Inuit pioneers entered the Canadian Arctic from Alaska and therefore has the potential to help us understand how they adapted to the challenges of moving into an unknown landscape. Despite recent research, many gaps in our knowledge of the Thule-Inuit occupation of Amundsen Gulf remain, including detailed studies of subsistence practices. Tiktalik's faunal material reveals that its occupants relied almost exclusively on ringed seals. Bone modification, ringed seal skeletal-element representation, and the age distribution of hunted ringed seals are also explored. The Tiktalik data provide a baseline for comparison with later sites on Amundsen Gulf and other early Thule-Inuit sites across the North American Arctic. | ['hodgetts', 'moody'] | ","['hodgetts', 'moody']",4

Approximate dating of succession stages was based on a study of the changing position of glacier fronts in the past approximately 100 years. The described succession corresponds to the uni-directional, non-replacement model of succession. All constituent species, except one, present in the nearby old tundra have colonized the glacier forelands since the end of the LIA. The first species appeared about 5 years after deglaciation. The latest succession stages closely resemble the old tundra. | ['prach', 'rachlewicz'] | ","['prach', 'rachlewicz']",1
450,"Summing up: Half a century of Quaternary geology | In summing up the research in Quaternary geology during the second half of the 20th century the topics discussed are restricted to those dealt with by the author. The results obtained in the various studies are viewed against the general advances made subsequently by others. The interpretations in the older investigations are naturally more out-of-date than those in recent works; in many cases the author has himself later been able to reinvestigate and reinterpret conclusions made earlier. The main part of the survey deals with studies of the Quaternary of Finland, starting with pollen stratigraphical problems, particularly of the Late Weichselian and the dating of the deglaciation, but also of the Holocene history, followed by a description of the identification and dating of land/sea level changes, which eventually lead to the construction of a shoreline profile across Fennoscandia from Estonia over Finland and Sweden to the coast of Norway. Topics of archaeology, glacial geology and Quaternary stratigraphy are also discussed. The investigations conducted in the British Isles include pollen analytical studies of the Late-glacial in Scotland, reconstructions of land/sea level changes in Scotland and Ireland, as well as a study of the glaciations of East Anglia and the East Midlands using stone orientation measurements of stones in till. Shorter, more limited, studies of the Quaternary stratigraphy of Long Island in the United States, including a pollen diagram of the Gardiners Clay of the Sangamon Interglacial, and pollen analytical studies of Cueca del Toll in Spain and Abri Pataud in France are described in separate chapters. Descriptions of investigations in the Arctic include studies of the geology of Brageneset in Nordaustlandet, of the land/sea level changes in West Greenland around Disko Bugt, as determined by radiocarbon dating of marine shells, and of a similar study of Finnmark in North Norway. Some observations made in Alaska are also mentioned. Localities used for dating marine shells in southeastern Australia are described, as well as sites along the coast of southern Africa used in studies of the stable isotope composition of recent marine shells. Finally a description is given of studies in the Western Desert of Egypt of playas with evidence of an early Holocene humid phase. Some concluding remarks about the Quaternary studies in general are presented at the end of the account. | ['donner'] | ",['donner'],4
451,"Supply and demand in prehistory? Economics of Neolithic mining in northwest Europe | The extent to which non-agricultural production in prehistory had cost-benefit motivations has long been a subject of discussion. This paper addresses the topic by looking at the evidence for Neolithic quarrying and mining in Britain and continental northwest Europe and asks whether changing production through time was influenced by changing demand. Radiocarbon dating of mine and quarry sites is used to define periods of use. These are then correlated with a likely first-order source of demand, the size of the regional populations around the mines, inferred from a radiocarbon-based population proxy. There are significant differences between the population and mine-date distributions. Analysis of pollen data using the REVEALS method to reconstruct changing regional land cover patterns shows that in Britain activity at the mines and quarries is strongly correlated with evidence for forest clearance by incoming Neolithic populations, suggesting that mine and quarry production were a response to the demand that this created. The evidence for such a correlation between mining and clearance in continental northwest Europe is much weaker. Here the start of large-scale mining may be a response to the arrival by long-distance exchange of high-quality prestige jade axes from a source in the Italian Alps. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc. | ['bevan', 'cook', 'edinborough', 'fyfe', 'kerig', 'parker', 'pearson', 'schauer', 'shennan'] | ","['bevan', 'cook', 'edinborough', 'fyfe', 'kerig', 'parker', 'pearson', 'schauer', 'shennan']",1
452,"Surveys of brown bears in Pasvik, Norway. Glimpses of scenery and natural history past and present | This article starts with Stavanger Museum's legendary curator, Hans Tho. L. Schaanning, who at the beginning of the 20th century carried out a comprehensive investigation of the fauna in Pasvikdal in Finnmark. He was a pioneer in the investigation of the bird species, but, being a passionate hunter, he was also very interested in bears and wolves. In articles, letters and reports he often mentioned bears which he had observed, and which he and his friend Johan Koren had, without success, tried to shoot. Thanks to Schaanning, Pasvik is today known as a classic area for scenery and wildlife. The author has also carried out extensive studies of the natural history of Pasvik over the last two decades. With a background of a strong interest in the pioneers Schaanning and Koren, it was natural to compare today's scenery and natural history with what it was like in the time of the pioneers. The emphasis of the article is on describing how bears were registered in the spring of 2005, with frequent glimpses of the author's experiences at the time, and some glances back to the past. At the same time he includes information about the scenery and wildlife, especially bears. | ['wikan'] | ",['wikan'],0
453,"Swedish beech woods have ancient roots | In the literature, Swedish beech (Fagus sylvatica) woods are often considered to be of recent origin. It has been claimed that many stands were sown or planted, partly with foreign acorn material, during the 19th century. However, an evaluation of historical maps and descriptions from the 17th to 19th centuries suggests that most beech woods are remnants of beech-dominated woods which covered large areas of south Sweden during the Middle Ages. There is no evidence for large-scale acorn import, and the majority of today's beech woods are self-regenerated. Beech woods with long continuity often contain many species with low dispersal capacity. They are not replaceable in reasonable time and should therefore be given high conservation priority. | ['brunet'] | ",['brunet'],1

455,"Systematic review of documented Indigenous Knowledge of freshwater biodiversity in the circumpolar Arctic | Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic have for millennia relied on freshwaters for drinking water and freshwater species that comprise important subsistence harvests, which promotes a strong connection to the land and unique understanding of organisms and ecosystem processes and changes. Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n¬†=¬†127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska; n¬†=¬†116), Fennoscandia (n¬†=¬†38), Russia (n¬†=¬†27), and Greenland (n¬†=¬†5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11‚Äì25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6‚Äì10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments. ¬© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. | ['ivanova', 'knopp', 'lento', 'levenstein', 'watson'] | ","['ivanova', 'knopp', 'lento', 'levenstein', 'watson']",4
456,"Tangled Worlds: The Swedish, the Sami, and the Reindeer | Reindeer pastoralism developed among the indigenous Sami of northern Fennoscandia, but the established colonial relationship with Sweden brought on an expanded use of reindeer. Tradesmen, priests, and officials of Swedish origin benefited from domesticated reindeer in many ways - trading reindeer products and using reindeer as transport during winter trips to marketplaces. Reindeer were, therefore, in many ways focal in the encounters between the Sami and the Swedish. In this paper, we use zooarchaeology, stable isotope analysis, and ancient DNA analysis to interpret reindeer remains from towns, marketplaces, and agrarian settlements in medieval and early modern northern Fennoscandia. We argue that reindeer played important roles in contacts and encounters. The Sami, the Swedish, and the reindeer formed a multispecies community. The exploration of the relationships in this multispecies community captures the complexity of human and human-animal relationships in colonial encounters. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance and agency of animals in colonial histories. | ['heino', 'salmi'] | ","['heino', 'salmi']",4
457,"Taphonomic phenomenon of ancient hair from Glacial Beringia: perspectives for palaeoecological reconstructions | An accumulation of mammoth hair, discovered in the Bol'shaya Chukochya River valley (northeast Yakutia, Russia), was found to contain remains of terrestrial and aquatic organisms, including plants, insects, crustaceans, birds and mammals. Radiocarbon dating indicated that this post-mortem taphocoenosis represented multiple time periods. The mammoth hair was dated to older than 45 ka BP, the plants were dated to 12 750 +/- 50 a BP (which corresponds to a shift in the environmental conditions and landscapes during the formation of thermokarst in northeastern Russia) and the bird feathers were dated to 4115 +/- 40 a BP. A scenario of the formation of this fossil assemblage is proposed, covering the MIS 3-1 time range. The hair also yielded various Arctic branchiopod crustaceans, which inhabit shallow temporary water bodies and therefore are important for reconstruction of palaeoenvironments. The cladoceran subgenus Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia), currently absent from the Asian part of Beringia, is reported from this region for the first time. The study demonstrates that the discovered permafrostpreserved hair is a unique repository of Ice Age organisms. | ['chernova', 'fadeeva', 'gubin', 'kirillova', 'kotov', 'lapteva', 'shidlovskiy', 'trofimova', 'van', 'kolfschoten', 'van', 'der', 'plicht', 'zanina', 'zharov', 'zinovyev'] | ","['chernova', 'fadeeva', 'gubin', 'kirillova', 'kotov', 'lapteva', 'shidlovskiy', 'trofimova', 'van', 'kolfschoten', 'van', 'der', 'plicht', 'zanina', 'zharov', 'zinovyev']",4

B.P.) archaeological sites. Local high rates of sediment deposition and low post-depositional disturbance allow for the interpretation of the function of archaeological occupations within larger economic and mobility strategies. Residential sites used over the long term seem to be located near critical but immovable resources such as clear water and vegetation. The spatial association of artifacts and faunal remains at other sites in the Flats suggest that they were specialized, short-lived locations dedicated to a single or few activities. For instance, the site of Swan Point Cultural Zone 4b is interpreted as a workshop related to the production of composite tools, particularly on mammoth ivory, and the site of Keystone Dune is interpreted as a camp related to wapiti (Cervus elaphus) hunting. These task-specific sites and others were probably used as part of a predominantly logistical mobility and economy strategy, which maximized efficiency in harvesting and processing resources that were distributed heterogeneously on the landscape. | ['holmes', 'lanoe', 'reuther'] | ","['holmes', 'lanoe', 'reuther']",4

462,"Taxonomy of vascular plants and phytogeography in the Institute of Botany of the Jagiellonian University (1913-1993) | The author's aim was to present the directions and achievements of taxonomic and phytogeographical investigations in the Institute of Botany of the Jagiellonian University (UJ) in Krakow, from the foundation in 1913 by Marian Raciborski through the following 80 years. Some centres of botany in other countries, former activities in the Commission of Plant Physiography in Krakow and cooperation with the Institute of Botany of the Polish Academy of Sciences, are also mentioned. Works in plant taxonomy, branch fundamental for other studies, had in the Institute of Botany UJ mainly a descriptive character (alfa taxonomy). It was connected among others with the preparation of the Polish Flora (Flora Polska publication in 14 volumes) and a handy flora Rosliny Polskie (Szafer, Kulczynski, Pawlowski 1924 and next editions). Problems of plant phylogeny (omega taxonomy) were undertaken mostly on the country's scale, in relation to selected groups of species. Bogumil Pawlowski, well known Polish taxonomist, and Jan Kornas (with co-authors) participated in some international enterprises: Flora Europaea, Atlas Florae Europaeae, Index Holmensis. Plant geography formed a chief part of the so called Krakow Geobotanical School. The main achievement here was the publication of a team-monograph The vegetation of Poland (Szafer ed. 1966 and two Polish editions). Original investigations of various authors concerned: geographical elements in the Polish flora, geobotanical characteristic of particular regions, mainly in the Karpaty Mts. and chorological works. Among them the most important are: Atlas of distribution of vascular plants in the Polish Carpathian Mts. which was being prepared by J. Kornas with contributors (selected maps are already published) and Distribution atlas of vascular plants in Poland (prospectus published in 1992), worked out by Adam Zajac and co-authors. For both projects the computer methods are used - from the beginning (atlas for Poland) or in final stage (atlas for Carpathians). The investigations executed by Institute staff-members outside Poland concerned: the Balcans, the Alps, Spitsbergen and the Antarctic, Mongolia and tropical Africa - for Zambia and Rwanda atlases of pteridophytes distribution were published (Kornas 1979, Kornas and Nowak 1993). Ecological plant geography, not discussed by the author, was in the Institute of Botany UJ treated jointly with ecology. Historical plant geography started by M. Raciborski and continued mainly by Wladyslaw Szafer - referred to original paleobotanical and palynological investigations in both Institutes: of the University and of the Academy. Changes involved in the flora and vegetation under human influences were noticed relatively early and induced activities in nature conservation, taken up first of all by W. Szafer. Conceptions of synanthropization, developed from the 1950's by J. Kornas, stimulated investigations of numerous authors.

463,"Tayara site (KbFk-7) and the Dorset period: Multidisciplinary research on a key Palaeoeskimo site of the Hudson Strait (Nunavik, Canada) | Over the last few years, a multidisciplinary research team has been assembled by the Avataq Cultural Institute to work on the Tayara site (KbFk-7) located on the southern shore of Hudson Strait in Nunavik, Northern Quebec. The geomorphologic context and the exceptional preservation of the archaeological layers give this Palaeoeskimo site a key role in understanding the prehistory of Eastern Arctic. This article presents the first observations as well as some preliminary results from this long-term research project including geoarchaeology, faunal, architecture, lithic and osseous industry analyses as well as a revision of the chronology and a discussion on the impact of those researches for the understanding of Palaeoeskimo chronology. The value of Tayara as a type site for the Early Dorset is reevaluated as we reconstitute the sequence of occupation. It illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in our search for a better understanding of the Palaeoeskimo way of life and in the analysis of archaeological sites in general. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

464,"Technology, taphonomy, and seasonality: Understanding differences between dorset and thule subsistence strategies at Iqaluktuuq, Victoria Island | This paper examines differences between Late Dorset and Thule Inuit subsistence economies at the Bell site on Victoria Island, Nunavut. This location is relatively unusual in the Canadian Arctic because local subsistence was based largely on caribou and fish, rather than the sea mammals that dominate in most other regions. For both periods, animal bone samples are quantified in terms of taxonomic frequencies, element (body part) distributions, seasonality, prey demography, and bone modifications such as cutting, burning, and gnawing. A comparison between the periods indicates many broad similarities in subsistence, but some subtle differences suggest that the Thule had a more focal and specialized economy, with a slightly different seasonal profile. ¬© The Arctic Institute of North America. | ['friesen', 'howse'] | ","['friesen', 'howse']",1
465,"Temporal and spatial aspects of peatland initiation following deglaciation in North America | A set of simple ecological models accounts well for the cumulative initiation of peatlands throughout North America in relation to glacial retreat. The most parsimonious form incorporates, first, a delay term to account for the lag during which newly deglaciated land became suitable for peatland initiation and, second, an intrinsic rate of initiation related to the probability of migration and establishment of plant propagules from elsewhere. The goodness of fit of the models, based on 1680 basal-peat dates throughout the continent, allows projection of past trends into the future. Factors contributing to the lag of about 4000 years between deglaciation and peatland initiation are suggested and data on colonization of deglaciated land by beavers (known to initiate peatlands) are presented. The rate of peatland initiation peaked between 7000 and 8000 years ago, but remains appreciable today. A marked depression of peatland initiation (8360-8040 BP) interrupted the peak rate. The time of the interruption matches the 8200 BP cold-dry event recorded in Greenland ice cores, and suggests that this event caused a substantial, continent-wide depression of an important ecosystem function, i.e., carbon sequestration from the atmosphere by peat deposition. Spontaneous initiation of new peatlands is projected to continue for millennia to come. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

466,"The terrestrial invertebrate fauna of the Svalbard archipelago in a changing world: history of research and challenges | The High Arctic represents a unique environment, an environment from where knowledge is limited and which is currently experiencing rapid change. The archipelago of Svalbard in the European High Arctic possesses a terrestrial and freshwater invertebrate fauna that is distinctive and diverse. However, the majority of studies concentrate on the fauna of the comparatively mild west coast. Very few investigations of the colder east coast exist. Furthermore, scientific investigations are relatively recent. Scientific records of the terrestrial invertebrate fauna begin in the mid-19th century with species inventories and community descriptions but experimental field-based studies and physiological investigations did not commence until the 1980s. Some 570 articles consider this fauna, 54% of which have appeared since 1990. There is hence a dramatic and rapid increase in our understanding, which is not only improving our comprehension of Arctic ecosystem functioning but also providing a baseline for environmental change studies. Due to a largely pristine environment, a political focus and relative ease of logistics, Svalbard is set to become a focus of such studies. This article considers the state of knowledge of the terrestrial and freshwater invertebrate fauna of Svalbard, current research, and discusses the threats to the distinctive communities. | ['coulson'] | ",['coulson'],4

469,"Over a Thousand Years of Evolutionary History of Domestic Geese from Russian Archaeological Sites, Analysed Using Ancient DNA | The European domestic goose is a widely farmed species known to have descended from the wild greylag goose (Anser anser). However, the evolutionary history of this domesticate is still poorly known. Ancient DNA studies have been useful for many species, but there has been little such work on geese. We have studied temporal genetic variation among domestic goose specimens excavated from Russian archaeological sites (4th-18th centuries) using a 204 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial control region. Specimens fell into three different genetic clades: the domestic D-haplogroup, the F-haplogroup that includes both wild and domestic geese, and a clade comprising another species, the taiga bean goose. Most of the subfossil geese carried typical domestic D-haplotypes. The domestication status of the geese carrying F-haplotypes is less certain, as the haplotypes identified were not present among modern domestic geese and could represent wild geese (misclassified as domestics), introgression from wild geese, or local domestication events. The bones of taiga bean goose were most probably misidentified as domestic goose but the domestication of bean goose or hybridization with domestic goose is also possible. Samples from the 4th to 10th century were clearly differentiated from the later time periods due to a haplotype that was found only in this early period, but otherwise no temporal or geographical variation in haplotype frequencies was apparent. | ['askeyev', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'aspi', 'heikkinen', 'heino', 'honka', 'kvist', 'searle', 'shaymuratova'] | ","['askeyev', 'askeyev', 'askeyev', 'aspi', 'heikkinen', 'heino', 'honka', 'kvist', 'searle', 'shaymuratova']",1

In this article whaling and walrus hunting and their impact on the environment is reconstructed. Annual catch records and shipping logs made it possible to calculate the original size of the populations and to reconstruct their original migration in the Greenland Sea.

471,"Three Species of Pinnipedia in Hunting Gain of Sea Hunters at the North-Western Coast of Chukchi Peninsula | The contribution of the main pinnipedian species (ringed seal (Pusa hispida), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus)) to the harvest of ancient sea mammal hunters of Chukotka is analyzed on the basis of the osteological material from three ancient settlements (the 3rd century BC - the 14th century AD). All three settlements - Kaniskak, Paypelgak and Vankarem - are located on the sea coast. Methodological aspects of various computations, in particular, factors forming an osteological sampling are of special importance. The analysis of the spectrum presenting elements of three pinnipedian species from different settlements showed that the probability of burying various skeletal parts was not equal due to local traditions of people or methods of butchering. The ringed seal predominated in all three sites (>80 %). A great number of bones of ringed seals provided for the possibility to clear up the age structure of the animals hunted. Aborigines were showed to harvest primarily the fastest reproducible age group - yearlings. One can suggest that the long-term harvest did not affect adversely the ringed seal population. This suggestion was also confirmed by the reconstruction of the ringed seal population abundance during the studied period. A relationship between the climate changes and the abundance of the ringed seal population in the study region was revealed, as well as a correlation between the climate changes and abundance of the ringed seal population. Cooling increased the number of the population in the hunting area. The measurements of femur bones of juvenile animals showed that the period of mass hunting of ringed seal fell on autumn, when harvest was possible in open water. | ['gorlova', 'vasyukov'] | ","['gorlova', 'vasyukov']",4
472,"Thriving or surviving? The isotopic record of the Wrangel Island woolly mammoth population | The world's last population of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) lived on Wrangel Island persisting well into the Holocene, going extinct at ca. 4000 cal BP. According to the frequency of 'radiocarbon dated mammoth remains from the island, the extinction appears fairly abrupt. This study investigates the ecology of the Wrangel Island mammoth population by means of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotope analyses. We report new isotope data on 77 radiocarbon dated mammoth specimens from Wrangel Island and Siberia, and evaluate them in relation to previously published isotope data for Pleistocene mammoths from Beringia and lower latitude Eurasia, and the other insular Holocene mammoth population from St. Paul Island. Contrary to prior suggestions of gradual habitat deterioration, the nitrogen isotope values of the Wrangel Island mammoths do not support a decline in forage quality/quantity, and are in fact very similar to their north Beringian forebears right to the end. However, compared to Siberian mammoths, those from Wrangel Island show a difference in their energy economy as judged by the carbon isotope values of structural carbonate, possibly representing a lower need of adaptive strategies for survival in extreme cold. Increased mid-Holocene weathering of rock formations in the central mountains is suggested by sulfur isotope values. Scenarios related to water quality problems stemming from increased weathering, and a possibility of a catastrophic starvation event as a cause of, or contributing factor in their demise are discussed.

473,"Timing and causes of mid-Holocene mammoth extinction on St. Paul Island, Alaska | Relict woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) populations survived on several small Beringian islands for thousands of years after mainland populations went extinct. Here we present multiproxy paleoenvironmental records to investigate the timing, causes, and consequences of mammoth disappearance from St. Paul Island, Alaska. Five independent indicators of extinction show that mammoths survived on St. Paul until 5,600 +/- 100 y ago. Vegetation composition remained stable during the extinction window, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 CE, suggesting that these factors were not extinction drivers. Instead, the extinction coincided with declining freshwater resources and drier climates between 7,850 and 5,600 y ago, as inferred from sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, and diatom and cladoceran assemblages in a sediment core from a freshwater lake on the island, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains. Contrary to other extinction models for the St. Paul mammoth population, this evidence indicates that this mammoth population died out because of the synergistic effects of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity caused by rising sea levels and regional climate change. Degradation of water quality by intensified mammoth activity around the lake likely exacerbated the situation. The St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best-dated prehistoric extinctions, highlighting freshwater limitation as an overlooked extinction driver and underscoring the vulnerability of small island populations to environmental change, even in the absence of human influence. | ['belmecheri', 'choy', 'culleton', 'davy', 'froese', 'graham', 'heintzman', 'hritz', 'kapp', 'newsom', 'rawcliffe', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'shapiro', 'wang', 'williams', 'wooller'] | ","['belmecheri', 'choy', 'culleton', 'davy', 'froese', 'graham', 'heintzman', 'hritz', 'kapp', 'newsom', 'rawcliffe', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'shapiro', 'wang', 'williams', 'wooller']",1

475,"Towards a first chronology for the middle settlement of Norse Greenland: 14C and related studies of animal bone and environmental material | The so-called Middle Settlement (Mellembygden) of Norse/Viking Greenland has received far less attention than either of its larger Eastern and Western counterparts. The Greenlandic Norse occupation is nominally taken to date between AD 985 and about AD 1450 and it is generally assumed that the Western Settlement was abandoned prior to the Eastern, but where the Middle Settlement fits into the pattern temporally has hitherto been completely unknown. This paper presents the first absolute dating evidence from the Middle Settlement. In addition to providing the results (14C, Œ¥13C, Œ¥15N) of a radiocarbon dating and stable isotope measurement program from domesticated (Bos, Ovis/Capra) and wild (Rangifer) animal bone and cultural-environmental (coastal, possibly midden) samples, the paper also addresses some problems of 14C estimation for the period of Norse occupation in Greenland. Investigations show a Medieval Scandinavian presence close to the start of the conventional landn√°m period (after AD 985) and with occupation continuing up to at least the 14th century AD. The start of this activity, found at 2 sites, bears comparison with various locations in both the Eastern and Western Settlement areas. The terminal phase of activity in the Middle Settlement is represented at 1 site only, but despite this limitation, it shows that the Norse may have been present for most of the period that they occupied sites in both the Western and Eastern settlements. Caribou bone from separate contexts that also contained Thule Inuit material proves useful in indicating dates for a probable post-Norse Inuit presence. The position of age estimates on the calibration curve underscores the need to look critically at such evidence when making chronological inference during the Norse period owing to the existence of plateaus and wiggles. The inclusion of samples from both domesticated and wild fauna considered to be possibly modern, yet reported from archaeological assemblages, provides a warning to archaeozoologists to be especially vigilant when considering the potential non-contemporaneity of material. ¬© 2013 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona. | ['cook', 'edward', 'schofield', 'edward', 'nyegaard'] | ","['cook', 'edward', 'schofield', 'edward', 'nyegaard']",1

477,"Transformation of traditional reindeer herding technologies and pasturing practices on the Kola Peninsula in the 20th‚Äî early 21st century | The purpose of the article is to give an accent presentation of the transformation of technologies and techniques of reindeer grazing and value attitudes of the Kola reindeer herders in the 20th ‚Äî early 21st century from an ethno-cultural perspective. The paper is based on the materials of the 2018 expedition to the Kola Peninsula. On the basis of using a system-analytical approach, the paper is structured as a narrative discourse, where the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù is given to the Kola reindeer herders themselves. As the studies show, the changes in the Kola reindeer husbandry brought about by the merger of the nomadic Samoyed-Izhem Culture, introduced to the Kola peninsula in the late 19th ‚Äî early 20th century, with the semi-nomadic ‚Äúcabin‚Äù Saami herding style, as well as by the Soviet period collective and state farm transformation of the traditional reindeer husbandry and the unfolding ‚Äúsnowmobile revolution‚Äù (the use of the reindeer sled has been reduced to one month in a year), have led not only to the loss of numerous traditional reindeer herding technologies, pasturing practices and herd control, but also to significant changes in the population composition, structure, and organization of the behavioral characteristics of the herds. Today, the Komi-Izhem reindeer husbandry is dominant in the Kola region. However, despite the major changes, the Kola herders are still quite flexible in using, depending on the circumstances, the advantages of both the Izhem and the Lapp reindeer husbandry systems. The return to the semi-free herds ranging practices and transition to rotational organization of reindeer herd tending in the post-Soviet period stimulated the economic revival of the herding industry and added more comfort to the reindeer herders' lifestyle, although the reindeer herding is not considered a prestigious occupation among young people. Rethinking the older generation's life experiences, together with the more critical perception of today's realities, is an indication of changes within the system of ethnic values, which formerly, in a sense, supported both the individual and collective identities of the Saami and Komi-Izhem ethnies. The transformation processes have had a particularly profound impact on the traditional Saami reindeer culture, almost destroying it, which causes painful memories and reactions of its last bearers. Displacement of the Lapp component is carried forward in the choice of preferred deer breeds and disappearance of the Saami language and Saami toponymy from the reindeer herding context. ¬© 2021 Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk.

Migration rates were calculated by first estimating the arrival dates of F. grandifolia and T. canadensis to cells within a 50 km rectilinear grid, each cell corresponding to a pollen data site. Migration maps were then constructed using vectors of movement between cells. The average migration rates for F. grandifolia and T. canadensis were 180 and 156 m/year, respectively, with a general direction of migration towards north and west. The distribution of migration rates was highly skewed, with the median rate about 40% less than the mean rate. | ['herstrom', 'king'] | ","['herstrom', 'king']",4
479,"Tree-ring dating of Russian Pomor settlements in Svalbard | Results of the tree-ring dating of samples from the three Russian settlements of the 18th century (Bjornbeinflyene, Palffyodden, and Schonningholmane) at Svalbard are presented. The present study is a development of a previous work (Chochorowski and Krapiec, 2017). These stations were discovered during excavations conducted by the Polish archaeological expedition of Jagiellonian University in the Sorkappland and Hornsund fjord regions of the Svalbard Archipelago. In total, 5 non-dated samples of the previous work were reanalyzed for these sites: Bjornbeinflyene (2 samples), Palffyodden (1 sample), Schonningholmane (1 sample) and relics from the landing site on the Torrflya coast (1 sample). All samples from these settlements are constructional elements of dwellings, appearing to be prefabricates brought from the continent, and only one of them is a driftwood timber. These floating chronologies were cross-dated against more than 200 master tree-ring chronologies from the Arctic coast, including as well our own data. Cross-dating was performed by CORINA software which includes t-values calculated with different detrending options. As a result, it was possible to successfully date and determine the place of origin of these samples. Results obtained do not contradict the data of radiocarbon and archaeological dating and indicate the possible use of wood from the territories of the White and Kara Sea basins as a building material for the Russian Pomor settlements in Svalbard. | ['chochorowski', 'kasatkina', 'krapiec', 'shumilov', 'szychowska', 'krapiec'] | ","['chochorowski', 'kasatkina', 'krapiec', 'shumilov', 'szychowska', 'krapiec']",4
480,"Trends in Intensive Management of Alaska's Grizzly Bears, 1980-2010 | Hunting regulations for grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in much of Alaska since 1980 increasingly were designed to reduce bear abundance in the expectation such regulations would lead to increased harvests by hunters of moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Regulations were liberalized during 1980-2010 primarily in the area we termed the Liberal Grizzly Bear Hunting Area (hereafter Liberal Hunt Area) which encompassed 76.2% of Alaska. By 2010, these changes resulted in longer hunting seasons (100% of Liberal Hunt Area had seasons > 100 days, 99.7% > 200 days, and 67.8% > 300 days), more liberal bag limits (99.1% of the Liberal Hunt Area with a bag limit >= 1/yr and 10.1% with a bag limit >= 2/yr), and widespread waiver of resident tag fees (waived in 95.7% of the Liberal Hunt Area). During 1995-2010, there were 124 changes that made grizzly bear hunting regulations more liberal and two making them more conservative. The 4-year mean for grizzly bear kills by hunters increased 213% between 1976-1980 (387 grizzly bears) and 2005-2008 (823 grizzly bears). Since 2000, long-term research studies on grizzly populations in the Liberal Hunt Area have been terminated without replacement. Management of large predators by the State of Alaska is constrained by a 1994 state statute mandating ""intensive management"" in areas classified as important for human consumptive use of ungulates. Current grizzly bear management in the Liberal Hunt Area is inconsistent with the recommendations of the National Research Council's 1997 report on predator management in Alaska. Current attitudes, policies and absence of science-based management of grizzly bears in Alaska are increasingly similar to those that resulted in the near extirpation of grizzly bears south of Canada in the 19th and 20th centuries. If current trends continue, they increase risks to portions of the largest and most intact population of grizzly bears in North America.

481,"Uncompensated extinctions in Wuerm. 5. Crisis in the Palaearctic | Predation by man is the principal cause of the extinction of mammoth, forest and namadic elephants, all Palaearctic rhinos, With the depression of these giants peculiar plant communities, sustained by their activity (mosaic woodlands, parklands and cryophytic savannah associations), were supplanted, according to each climatic zone, by tundras, taiga or dense leaf-bearing forests. Ungulates and carnivores could not use ""mammoths' paths"" through thickets and snow any more. In steppes (both on plains and on highlands) vegetation became less mosaic, and fires more frequent and intensive (in absence of gigantic grazers more grass than before rested uneaten and dried up). Because of all this, territories, fit for viable populations of such herbivores as Ursus spelaeus, U. rossicus, Megaceros spp., Spirocerus kiakhtensis, Parabubalis capricornis, Ovibos moschatus, Bos grunniens baikalensis, siberian race of Bos (Bison) priscus, Equus hidruntinus, forest races of E. caballus s. l. drastically shrinked. Diminishing populations of these species became more and more isolated and were gradually outsted by multiplying populations of extant herbivores more fit for existence in the environment without pachyderms. So successful competitors of Bos priscus in Siberia were extant Cervidae, in steppic zone it was Bos primigenius. Subsidiary factors of extinction of the mentioned herbivores were changes of the competitive conditions caused by human hunting and burning activity. The predation from packs of wolves that multiplied because of the decline of their foes (lions, leopards, cave hyenas) could also accelerate the decline of populations of herbivores, depressed by afore-mentioned environmental changes. It may be the main reason of extinction of european tahr (Hemitrogus bonali). The principal cause of the decline of cave lions, cave hyenas, leopards and dholes in Northern Eurasia was the impoverishment of large prey. Besides this the 3 first species unsuccessfully completed with man, and dhole - with wolf, previously suppressed by larger predators. The extinction of a series of soil mites belonging to Oribatidae is linked with the change of soil conditions after the cessation of grazing activity of mammoths and other extinct herbivores. Extinction of Palaearctic pachyderms was long-lasing and gradual. Therefore considerably more forms than in America could adapt themselves to environmental changes. This is the main reason of the conservation of horses in Palaearctic and their expiration in America. Climatic factors played only subsidiary role in Wurm extinctions by accelerating or retarding the process. | ['puchkov'] | ",['puchkov'],4
482,"Unresolved Questions about Site Formation, Provenience, and the Impact of Natural Processes on Bone at the Bluefish Caves, Yukon Territory | Recent reanalysis of material excavated from the Bluefish Caves, Yukon Territory claims to have identified culturally modified bone dating to 24,000 cal. BP, thereby providing evidence for continuous human occupation of eastern Beringia from the Last Glacial Maximum. However, the recent research largely ignores the history of criticisms of the site and leaves outstanding questions about the site context, associations of lithic artifacts and Last Glacial Maximum radiocarbon dates, and the impact of natural processes on the faunal assemblage, and therefore, how the site fits into the broader Beringian archaeological record. This paper critically analyzes the archaeological record from Bluefish Caves by focusing on evidence for significantly disturbed archaeological contexts and alteration of bone by nonanthropogenic processes. We offer alternative hypotheses explaining the archaeological record at Bluefish Caves based on published data that were not considered in the recent reanalysis. These alternative hypotheses must be addressed before Bluefish Caves can be considered evidence for a Last Glacial Maximum occupation of Beringia. Bluefish Caves remains provocative but unconvincing archaeological evidence for the Beringian Standstill supported by genetic data. | ['blong', 'krasinski'] | ","['blong', 'krasinski']",4

There are also shallow waterbodies, several steep canyons, and two minor mountains barely reaching above the tree-line. Numerous contributions to the botany of the park have been published, but a compilation of its vascular flora has not been made until now. Major early contributions were made by E.

486,"Vegetational History and Recent Conditions in the 2 Northernmost Localities for Thelypteris-Palustris in Sweden | Thelypteris palustris Schott has a circumpolar distribution. The species reaches its northern limit in north Sweden, where two isolated localities are situated. The vegetational hsitory, with special regard to the occurrence of Thelypteris palustris, and the present vegetation in the two localities are described hre. The two sites are rich fens, dominated by lawn and carpet communities. Thelypteris palustris has a long continuity in both sites. The fern colonized the virgin mires, which were primarily formed on ground 'borne from the sea' by land uplift, about 8000 and 4000 years ago, respectively. In the past, when the climatic conditions were more favourable for Thelypteris palustris, the species was considerably more abundant than today. In the northernmost locality, where the fern is restricted to two small stands, the regeneration seems to be exclusively vegetative. Spore production has not been observed and the shoots are smaller than usual. In this site the long-term survival of the species is probably threatened. | ['elveland', 'ohlson'] | ","['elveland', 'ohlson']",1
487,"Vegetational response to human colonisation of the coastal and volcanic environments of Ketilsstadir, southern Iceland | Tephra-dated, high-resolution pollen profiles from Ketilsstaoir, southern Iceland, indicate a largely unwooded pre-settlement environment, a probable consequence of the exposed coastal location. The degree of change associated with the Norse landnam is more limited than in many Icelandic pollen diagrams. There are three main periods of change in the post-settlement vegetational development of the area. Firstly, Norse settlement affected the hydrology of the bog, resulting in the near-disappearance of Sphagnum and agricultural activity led to a reduction of some species (e.g. Angelica spp. and, Salix). Secondly, the establishment of probable permanent settlement in the mid-11th century AD initiated expansion of such apophytic taxa as Plantago spp. Lactuceae, Ranunculus spp. and Pteridophytes. Thirdly, the >= 10 cm thick Katla tephra, deposited in AD 1357, enhanced drainage of the bog surface, favouring dryland taxa (e.g. Poaceae, Galium and Lactuceae). The tephra deposit and the associated drainage probably caused or contributed to the local extinction of the wetland beetle Hydraena britteni. The study has enabled a series of natural and humanly-related issues to be addressed including tephra-vegetation relationships, the anthropogenic reduction in plant diversity, and comparisons between historical and environmental settlement records.

There is heavy reliance on the occurrence of deserted farms and farmyards as well as on pollen-analysis. A retrospective use of written records and later archaeological evidence is also employed.

493,"What's the catch? Archaeological application of rapid collagen-based species identification for Pacific Salmon | Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are ecological and cultural keystone species along the Northwest Coast of North America and are ubiquitous in archaeological sites of the region. The inability to morphologically identify salmonid post-cranial remains to species, however, can limit our understanding of the ecological and cultural role different taxa played in the seasonal subsistence practices of Indigenous groups in the past. Here, we present a rapid, cost-effective ZooMS method to distinguish salmonid species based on collagen peptide mass-fingerprinting. Using modern reference material and an assemblage of 28 DNA-identified salmonid bones from the pre-contact Yup'ik site of Nunalleq, Western Alaska, we apply high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify a series of potential collagen peptide markers to distinguish Pacific salmon. We then confirm these peptide markers with a blind ZooMS analysis (MALDI-TOF-MS) of the archaeological remains. We successfully distinguish five species of anadmmous salmon with this ZooMS approach, including one specimen that could not be identified through ancient DNA analysis. Our biomolecular identification of chum (43%), sockeye (21%), chinook (18%), coho (11%) and pink (7%), confirm the exploitation of all five available species of salmonid at Nunalleq. | ['bottomley', 'britton', 'collins', 'dobney', 'fischer', 'hickinbotham', 'hulme', 'beaman', 'masson', 'maclean', 'mcgrath', 'richter', 'speller', 'tedder', 'zona'] | ","['bottomley', 'britton', 'collins', 'dobney', 'fischer', 'hickinbotham', 'hulme', 'beaman', 'masson', 'maclean', 'mcgrath', 'richter', 'speller', 'tedder', 'zona']",4
494,"Widespread continental mtDNA lineages prevail in the bumblebee fauna of Iceland | Origins of the fauna in Iceland is controversial, although the majority of modern research supports the postglacial colonization of this island by terrestrial invertebrates rather than their long-term survival in glacial refugia. In this study, we use three bumblebee species as a model to test the hypothesis regarding possible cryptic refugia in Iceland and to evaluate a putative origin of recently introduced taxa. Bombus jonellus is thought to be a possible native Icelandic lineage, whereas B. lucorum and B. hortorum were evidently introduced in the second half of the 20(th) century. These phylogeographic analyses reveal that the Icelandic Bombus jonellus shares two COI lineages, one of which also occurs in populations on the British Isles and in mainland Europe, but a second lineage (BJ-02) has not been recorded anywhere. These results indicate that this species may have colonized Iceland two times and that the lineage BJ-02 may reflect a more ancient Late Pleistocene or Early Holoccne founder event (e.g., from the British Isles). The Icelandic populations of both Bomb us lucorum and B. horlorum share the COI lineages that were recorded as wide-spread throughout Eurasia, from the European countries across Russia to China and Japan. The findings presented here highlight that the bumblebee fauna of Iceland comprises mainly widespread ubiquitous lineages that arrived via natural or human-mediated dispersal events from the British Isles or the mainland. | ['bolotov', 'filippov', 'gofarov', 'kolosova', 'kondakov', 'potapov', 'tomilova'] | ","['bolotov', 'filippov', 'gofarov', 'kolosova', 'kondakov', 'potapov', 'tomilova']",4
495,"Wild reindeer hunting in Arctic Norway: Landscape, reindeer migration patterns and the distribution of hunting pits in Finnmark | Hunting pits for wild reindeer are found in large numbers across northern Fennoscandia. In Finnmark County, Arctic Norway, hunting pits are the most common category of cultural heritage site. Based on the distribution and density of hunting pits throughout Finnmark we have identifi ed what we see as signifi cant distribution patterns. Most hunting pits in Finnmark are located adjacent to the inner fjords and the large rivers of the interior, while such sites are almost absent in the outer coastal areas. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that a majority of hunting pits are located along the Deatnu (Fi. Teno, No. Tana) waterway, and that a large percentage of the pits are found in two geographical areas. One cluster is located at the V√°rjjat (No. Varanger) Isthmus in Eastern Finnmark, and the other is found by the lower K√°r√°≈°johka (Fi. Kaarasjoki, No. K√°r√°sjohka) and upper Deatnu Rivers in inner Finnmark. There are ample reasons to assume that both areas had a very high abundance of wild reindeer in prehistoric times and in the Medieval Period. Hunting pits in inland Finnmark have been dated to the Late Stone Age and the Early Metal Period, whilst hunting pits on the V√°rjjat Isthmus have been connected to S√°mi reindeer hunting in the Medieval Period. However, we argue that hunting pits both in the interior and at the V√°rjjat Isthmus could have been used over a long period of time and may be partly contemporary. The hunting pit systems in both clusters are located adjacent to the Deatnu River - the largest waterway in Finnmark, and the river may have been an important premise for the use of these sites throughout prehistoric and historic times. | ['holm', 'olsen', 'myrvoll', 'thuestad'] | ","['holm', 'olsen', 'myrvoll', 'thuestad']",4

497,"Wolf and Bear Depredation on Livestock in Northern Sweden 1827-2014: Combining History, Ecology and Interviews | During the twenty-first century, large carnivores have increased in human dominated landscapes after being extinct or nearly extinct. This has resulted in increasing numbers of livestock killed by large carnivores. The intent of this paper is to give a land use-historical perspective on the recent livestock-carnivore conflict in boreal Sweden. More specifically we address: (1) depredation risks (livestock killed by carnivores) and (2) local knowledge of how to protect livestock from predation and whether it survived among pastoralists until the present. This study provides numeric information on carnivores, livestock and depredation, combined with oral information from summer farmers about livestock protection. We compare recent (since 1998) and historical (late nineteenth century) depredation rates in two Swedish counties. In Dalarna recent depredation rates are higher than historical rates while the opposite pattern is seen in Jamtland. Recent depredation rates in Dalarna are twice the recent rates in Jamtland, in contrast to the historical situation. Recent and historical depredation rates are of the same order. Summer farmers traditionally graze their livestock in forested areas where carnivores reside. Interviews show that traditional knowledge of how to protect livestock from carnivores was lost during the twentieth century, but recently new knowledge has developed leading to changes in summer farming practices. The carnivore-livestock situation today differs from the historical situation, not so much in levels of depredation, but mainly regarding the possibilities of farmers to face challenges associated with increasing carnivore populations. | ['kvarnstrom', 'linkowski', 'moen', 'ostlund', 'westin'] | ","['kvarnstrom', 'linkowski', 'moen', 'ostlund', 'westin']",4
498,"Wood procurement in Norse Greenland (11th to 15th c. AD) | The Norse Greenlanders were dependent on wood for making houses, boats, utensils, tools and as fuel. Due to Greenland's northerly latitude and short, cool summers, the local woody taxa include relatively few species, most of which are low-growing shrubs. Consequently, it has been argued that import of timber was necessary to meet the wood requirements of the Norse Greenlanders. The taxa of archaeological wood assemblages from five Norse sites in Greenland, the episcopal manor Gar√∞ar/Igaliku (√ò47), Tatsip Ataa Killeq (√ò172), Tasilikulooq (√ò171), Narsaq (√ò17a) and G√•rden under Sandet (GUS) were analysed to determine whether the wood was native, import or driftwood. This paper demonstrates that farmers in Greenland used mainly driftwood and native wood, while high-status sites like Igaliku had access to sporadic timber imports from mainland Europe and North America. Furthermore, the proportions of driftwood taxa from the Norse settlements are more or less the same as of Inuit and pre-Inuit cultures in Greenland and the Smith Sound. These results suggest that the Norse Greenlanders were not reliant on imported wood but were in fact mostly self-sufficient in regard to their timber resources. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd | ['gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir'] | ",['gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir'],1

During 1999 the Western Aleutians Archaeological and Paleobiological Project excavated archaeological sites on north Adak Island, Alaska. Faunal remains from two excavation pits at ADK-011 are analyzed here. This is the first analysis of faunal remains from this particular island. Our research reveals that late prehistoric Aleuts depended on marine mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. Although whale remains were recovered, it is currently impossible to tell if these represent hunted or stranded animals. Birds were hunted for their valuable bones as well as for their meat. Aleuts captured both pelagic and near-shore fish. Invertebrate remains indicate that prehistoric Aleuts depended on nearby high energy reefs as well as the calmer waters of Clam Lagoon for subsistence. Additionally, the marine reservoir effect must be considered when understanding radiocarbon dates from Aleutian archaeological sites. | ['corbett', 'lefevre', 'west'] | ","['corbett', 'lefevre', 'west']",0

502,"Zoogeographical implications of variation in mitochondrial DNA of Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) | Most of the northern half of North America's freshwater fish survived the last glacial period in unfrozen refugia peripheral to the ice sheets. In our study, the question of which refugia Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) inhabited during the Wisconsinan Ice Age, and how they subsequently dispersed to their present geographical range, was examined using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis. mtDNA from 12 T. arcticus populations was analysed by direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). Our data support the hypotheses that T. arcticus had a large refugial population in the Bering Refuge (shown by high mtDNA diversity in extant Alaskan populations) and that British Columbia was colonized from the Bering Refuge (shown by mtDNA haplotype similarities). Our data also show that a disjunct southern set of populations in Montana is significantly different from the northern grayling, in terms of restriction haplotype frequency and distinguishing sequence characteristics. Sequence results yielded an estimated divergence time of 370 000 years between the northern and Montana grayling haplotypes. We conclude that T. arcticus survived the Wisconsinan glaciation in at least two refugia: (i) the Bering Refuge north of the ice sheets; and (ii) either the Upper Missouri or the southwest Alberta Refuge, south of the ice sheet. | ['redenbach', 'taylor'] | ","['redenbach', 'taylor']",1
0,"14C dating of peat and Œ¥18O-Œ¥D in ground ice from northwest Siberia | We present new radiocarbon dates from a number of Holocene peat deposits along a north-south transect across the Yamal Peninsula. The samples were collected from frozen peat deposits with large ice wedges in: the northern tundra near Seyaha Settlement, in the Central Yamal Peninsula, the southern tundra in Shchuch'ya River valley at the Edem'yaha mouth, the southern part of the Yamal Peninsula, and the southern forest tundra near Labytnangi Town. 14C dates of wood remains from the tundra in the Yamal Peninsula could be used to reconstruct a northern limit of forest during the Holocene Optimum. The wood layers at the bottom of the peat give evidence for immigration of trees further north beyond the present boundary. The first forest appearance in the Seyaha River valley area is dated about 9 ka BP according to the oldest peat date in the Seyaha cross section. This suggests that summer temperatures were higher than at present. Very fast accumulation of peat (around 5 m/ka: about 9-8 ka BP at Seyaha and about 7-6 ka BP at Shchuch'ya) also supports this observation. In contrast, oxygen isotope composition of Holocene syngenetic ice wedges from the area (Œ¥18O= -19.1 to -20.3% in the Seyaha cross-section and -17.3 to -20.3% in the Shchuch'ya River) show that winter temperatures were significantly lower than presently, i.e. the climate during the Holocene Optimum was slightly more continental.

The palynological and macrofossil analyses give a detailed picture of the vegetational succession consisting of three Late Weichselian and three Holocene stages. The first two phases represent pioneer vegetation before the development of forests. The NAP flora is very rich with many exotic elements, i.a. Dryas octopetala. Birches have been present from the beginning, first as solitary copses but by the end of the I-ate Weichselian as light forests. Betula nana characterizes the intermediate phase between open vegetation and forest. The Holocene forests have been dominated by pine and birches.

3,"The appearance and disappearance of major vegetational assemblages: Long-term vegetational dynamics in eastern North America | Contoured maps of pollen percentages from eastern North America illustrate that the vegetation changed continuously during the past 18000 years. The maps show that the geographic distribution for selected pollen types from 500 years ago parallels the major patterns in the vegetation, and that the correspondence is good enough to justify using maps of fossil pollen to interpret the patterns and composition of the broad-scale vegetation from earlier times. Data for Artemisia, Cyperaceae, Picea, Betula, Alnus, Abies, and Pinus pollen illustrate how the changing location and abundance of their plant taxa and populations altered the spatial pattern, local composition, and the overall structure of the vegetation and thus led to thedisappearance as well as appearance of major biomes and ecotones. For example, the Picea parkland biome that existed from 18000 to 12000 yr B.P. within a broad region south of the ice sheet disappeared within 2000 years after 12000 yr B.P., and the modern boreal forest biome began to develop across a large area of central Canada only after 6000 yr B.P. On a time scale of 104 to 106 yr, these types of vegetation changes involve a continual overlapping and separation of the abundance distributions for different taxa. Such changes are likely to have been a feature of vegetational dynamics for millions of years. ¬© 1987 Dr W. Junk Publishers. | ['webb', 'iii'] | ","['webb', 'iii']",2

6,"Biogeographical history of northeastern Asiatic soricine shrews (Insectivora, mammalia) | A hypothetical biogeographical history of northeastern Asiatic soricine shrews in the late Quaternary was developed by integrating their present distributions, fossil records, a hypothetical phylogeny, and geological investigations. First, a biological area cladogram of the northeastern Asiatic region was constructed by applying the vicariance hypothesis to the phylogeny of the caecutiens/shinto group, a monophyletic group proposed by Ohdachi et al. (1997). Comparing the biological area cladogram with a geological hypothesis by Ohshima (1990, 1991, 1992), we hypothesized a geographical history of northeastern Asia. Species were then located on the dendrogram of the geographical history, referring to the present distributions, fossil records, and phylogeny of shrews. According to our hypothesis, higher species diversity of the northern region of northeastern Asia (Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and Eastern Siberia) was achieved by several series of colonizations and habitat expansion. On the other hand, the shrew communities of the southern region (Honshu, Sado, Shikoku, and Kyushu) were created by extinction and isolation followed by speciation. | ['abe', 'dokuchaev', 'masuda', 'ohdachi'] | ","['abe', 'dokuchaev', 'masuda', 'ohdachi']",1

With the exception of a few marshes, peatlands are classified into bogs (18 forms), fens (17 forms), and swamps (21 forms). Bogs are the most widespread compared to fens and swamps. Peatlands occur throughout most of Canada but are most common in the Boreal, Subarctic, and Arctic Wetland Regions. Species richness for plants clearly separates bogs and fens. Average number of total species is greater in fens than in bogs. Species richness of herbs, fern and fern allies, and bryophytes is greater in fens than in bogs, and it is greater in bogs for trees and lichens. Bryophytes contribute the most to species richness in bogs, while herbs are most important in fens. Bogs on the Atlantic coast appear to have greater species numbers of lichens and shrubs than bogs on the Pacific coast. Herbs likely contribute more to total species numbers in fens in eastern Canada than in western Canada. There are species of mammals, birds, herptiles, biting flies, beetles, dragon-flies, water mites, rotifers, and protozoans that are restricted to peatlands or are found in both peatlands and other habitats. | ['asada', 'warner'] | ","['asada', 'warner']",1

9,"Birch pollen measurements and the history of birch at Bruvatnet, Norwegian Lapland | Birch pollen measurements were carried out on a Holocene sediment sequence from lake Bruvatnet, in the birch-forest region of Norwegian Lapland. Betula pollen diameters were measured systematically from samples that were taken at 5 cm intervals. The resulting size-frequency distributions were analysed statistically to infer their species composition and to reconstruct the local history of birch. Birch catkin scales and fruits were used as an independent supplementary evidence. According to the vegetation reconstruction based on these results shows that Betula tortuosa has grown in the area throughout the Holocene. In the beginning of the Holocene B. pubescens was also present and its occurrence reached a peak in the birch-pine woodland phase prior to the onset of pine decline. While pine receeded southwards, 5000-3000 BP, B. pubescens also gradually ceased to grow around the lake and the vegetation became more open. | ['makela'] | ",['makela'],1
10,"Bison extirpation may have caused aspen expansion in western Canada | The aspen Populus tremuloides parkland that forms the northern margin of the North American grassland or prairie has been variously attributed either individually or in different combinations to the ecological effects of prairie fire, fire suppression, frequent drought, and grazing. Plains bison Bison bison bison, formerly abundant on the western North American plains, inhibited growth of aspen by browsing, wallowing, trampling and toppling. Historical references show that aspen populations have expanded over the past century, and fossil pollen evidence suggests that the expansion occurred mainly after the near extinction of bison but before European homesteading and subsequent fire suppression in the late 1800s. We suggest that a prehistoric cycle of grassland, fire, aspen suckering, bison activity, and return to grassland was interrupted by the removal of bison, allowing aspen expansion. | ['blyth', 'campbell', 'campbell', 'mcandrews'] | ","['blyth', 'campbell', 'campbell', 'mcandrews']",1

There is some question as to whether trees survived in unglaciated portions of Alaska during the last glacial period. Spruce trees became prevalent about 10000 yr ago and may still be expanding to their climatic limits. In some areas of Alaska the treeline was more expanded during the Hypsithermal period than it is at present, but in other regions evidence for such an expansion is lacking.

17,"Climate change and Arctic ecosystems: 1. Vegetation changes north of 55 degrees N between the last glacial maximum, mid-Holocene, and present | [1] A unified scheme to assign pollen samples to vegetation types was used to reconstruct vegetation patterns north of 55degreesN at the last glacial maximum (LGM) and mid-Holocene (6000 years B. P.). The pollen data set assembled for this purpose represents a comprehensive compilation based on the work of many projects and research groups. Five tundra types (cushion forb tundra, graminoid and forb tundra, prostrate dwarf-shrub tundra, erect dwarf-shrub tundra, and low- and high-shrub tundra) were distinguished and mapped on the basis of modern pollen surface samples. The tundra-forest boundary and the distributions of boreal and temperate forest types today were realistically reconstructed. During the mid-Holocene the tundra-forest boundary was north of its present position in some regions, but the pattern of this shift was strongly asymmetrical around the pole, with the largest northward shift in central Siberia (similar to200 km), little change in Beringia, and a southward shift in Keewatin and Labrador (similar to200 km). Low- and high-shrub tundra extended farther north than today. At the LGM, forests were absent from high latitudes. Graminoid and forb tundra abutted on temperate steppe in northwestern Eurasia while prostrate dwarf-shrub, erect dwarf-shrub, and graminoid and forb tundra formed a mosaic in Beringia. Graminoid and forb tundra is restricted today and does not form a large continuous biome, but the pollen data show that it was far more extensive at the LGM, while low- and high-shrub tundra were greatly reduced, illustrating the potential for climate change to dramatically alter the relative areas occupied by different vegetation types. | ['anderson', 'andreev', 'bartlein', 'bigelow', 'brubaker', 'christensen', 'cramer', 'edward', 'gajewski', 'harrison', 'holmqvist', 'igarashi', 'kaplan', 'kremenetskii', 'lozhkin', 'matveyeva', 'mcguire', 'murray', 'paus', 'pisaric', 'prentice', 'razzhivin', 'ritchie', 'smith', 'volkova', 'walker', 'wolf'] | ","['anderson', 'andreev', 'bartlein', 'bigelow', 'brubaker', 'christensen', 'cramer', 'edward', 'gajewski', 'harrison', 'holmqvist', 'igarashi', 'kaplan', 'kremenetskii', 'lozhkin', 'matveyeva', 'mcguire', 'murray', 'paus', 'pisaric', 'prentice', 'razzhivin', 'ritchie', 'smith', 'volkova', 'walker', 'wolf']",2
18,"180,000 Years of Climate Change in Europe: Avifaunal Responses and Vegetation Implications | Providing an underutilized source of information for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, birds are rarely used to infer paleoenvironments despite their well-known ecology and extensive Quaternary fossil record. Here, we use the avian fossil record to investigate how Western Palearctic bird assemblages and species ranges have changed across the latter part of the Pleistocene, with focus on the links to climate and the implications for vegetation structure. As a key issue we address the full-glacial presence of trees in Europe north of the Mediterranean region, a widely debated issue with evidence for and against emerging from several research fields and data sources. We compiled and analyzed a database of bird fossil occurrences from archaeological sites throughout the Western Palearctic and spanning the Saalian-Eemian-Weichselian stages, i.e. 190,000-10,000 years BP. In general, cold and dry-adapted species dominated these late Middle Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene fossil assemblages, with clear shifts of northern species southwards during glacials, as well as northwards and westwards shifts of open-vegetation species from the south and east, respectively and downwards shifts of alpine species. A direct link to climate was clear in Northwestern Europe. However, in general, bird assemblages more strongly reflected vegetation changes, underscoring their usefulness for inferring the vegetation structure of past landscapes. Forest-adapted birds were found in continuous high proportions throughout the study period, providing support for the presence of trees north of the Alps, even during full-glacial stages. Furthermore, the results suggest forest-dominated but partially open Eemian landscapes in the Western Palearctic, including the Northwestern European subregion. | ['holm', 'svenning'] | ","['holm', 'svenning']",2
19,"The climate, the fuel and the land use: Long-term regional variability of biomass burning in boreal forests | The influence of different drivers on changes in North American and European boreal forests biomass burning (BB) during the Holocene was investigated based on the following hypotheses: land use was important only in the southernmost regions, while elsewhere climate was the main driver modulated by changes in fuel type. BB was reconstructed by means of 88 sedimentary charcoal records divided into six different site clusters. A statistical approach was used to explore the relative contribution of (a) pollen-based mean July/summer temperature and mean annual precipitation reconstructions, (b) an independent model-based scenario of past land use (LU), and (c) pollen-based reconstructions of plant functional types (PFTs) on BB. Our hypotheses were tested with: (a) a west-east northern boreal sector with changing climatic conditions and a homogeneous vegetation, and (b) a north-south European boreal sector characterized by gradual variation in both climate and vegetation composition. The processes driving BB in boreal forests varied from one region to another during the Holocene. However, general trends in boreal biomass burning were primarily controlled by changes in climate (mean annual precipitation in Alaska, northern Quebec, and northern Fennoscandia, and mean July/summer temperature in central Canada and central Fennoscandia) and, secondarily, by fuel composition (BB positively correlated with the presence of boreal needleleaf evergreen trees in Alaska and in central and southern Fennoscandia). Land use played only a marginal role. A modification towards less flammable tree species (by promoting deciduous stands over fire-prone conifers) could contribute to reduce circumboreal wildfire risk in future warmer periods. | ['blarquez', 'bradshaw', 'carcaillet', 'clear', 'davis', 'kaplan', 'lehsten', 'molinari'] | ","['blarquez', 'bradshaw', 'carcaillet', 'clear', 'davis', 'kaplan', 'lehsten', 'molinari']",2

A peat plateau profile (Ortino II) is analyzed for plant macrofossils, sediment type, loss on ignition, and radiocarbon dating. A paleosol profile (Ortino III) is described and radiocarbon dated. A previously published peat plateau profile (Ortino I) was analyzed for pollen and conifer stomata, loss on ignition, and radiocarbon dating. The interpretation of the latter site is reassessed in view of new evidence. Spruce immigrated to the study area at about 8900 14C yr B.P. Peatland development started at approximately the same time. During the Early Holocene Hypsithermal taiga forests occupied most of the present East-European tundra and peatlands were permafrost free. Cooling started after 5000 14C yr B.P., resulting in a retreat of forests and permafrost aggradation. Remaining forests disappeared from the study area around 3000 14C yr B.P., coinciding with more permafrost aggradation. The retreat of forests resulted in landscape instability and the redistribution of sand by eolian activity. The displacement of the Arctic forest line and permafrost zones indicates a warming of at least 2-3degreeC in mean July and annual temperatures during the Early Holocene. At least two cooling periods can be recognized for the second half of the Holocene, starting at about 4800 and 3000 14C yr B.P. | ['kaakinen', 'kuhry', 'valiranta'] | ","['kaakinen', 'kuhry', 'valiranta']",0

22,"Climatic tolerances and zoogeography of the Late Pleistocene beetle fauna of Beringia | The study of fossil beetles has played an important role in the reconstruction of Beringian paleoenvironments. More than 25 fossil localities have yielded Late Pleistocene beetle assemblages, comprising more than 300 species, of which about 147 are predators and scavengers, groups which are suitable for paleoclimatic reconstruction. The author has developed climate envelopes (climatic parameters characterizing the modern localities in which species are found) for these species, in order to perform mutual climatic range paleotemperature studies. This paper describes the thermal requirements of these beetles, and their zoogeographic history since the interval just prior to the last interglacial period. The fossil assemblages include 14 arctic and alpine species, 66 boreo-arctic species, and 68 boreal and temperate species. The greatest percentage of species with restricted thermal requirements occurs in the arctic and alpine group. The majority of boreo-arctic and boreal and temperate species have very broad thermal requirements. Based on modern distribution and the North American fossil record, it appears that some species resided exclusively in Beringia during the Late Pleistocene. These Beringian species comprise 64 % of the arctic and alpine species found in the fossil assemblages, 34 % of the boreo-arctic species, and only 1 % of the boreal and temperate species. | ['elia'] | ",['elia'],0
23,"The holocene closing of the 'ice-free' corridor: A biogeographical perspective | Biogeographical corridors are continuous areas of similar habitat that connect two biogeographical regions and allow the migration of fauna and flora. Examples of Quaternary faunal radiation between the Nearctic and Palearctic biogeographic regions and between Beringia and the Great Plains indicate that the 'ice-free' corridor region of western Canada must have been such a route for grazing animals. Today, boreal forest and extensive peatlands in the ice free corridor region separate the open vegetation of the grasslands and arctic tundra. However, it is likely that open vegetation existed between Beringia and the plains, creating a biogeographic corridor during some Pleistocene glacial stages and during glacial non-glacial transitions such as the Late Glacial-Early Holocene. Between 12,000 and 10,000 BP the corridor supported a herb and shrub dominated vegetation that included Populus trees and probably reflected a climate that was relatively warm in the summer and dry. Vertebrate paleontological evidence indicates that the corridor vegetation supported grazing fauna. The most recent closing of the biogeographic corridor occurred with the development of the present boreal forest, which is dominated by plants unsuitable for grazing. The development of forest was initiated by a rapid northward spread of Picea glauca and P. mariana from the eastern plains and western mountains at 10,000 BP. By 8000 BP the Picea forests in the corridor were as dense as at present. The extensive peatlands that typify much of the corridor today developed by similar to 5000 BP and provide an additional impediment for the movement of some grazing animals.

24,"Coastal heathlands of Central to Northern Norway | The western coastline of Norway is characterized by long fjords and numerous islands. This holds true particularly for the coastline of Trondelag and Nordland, which constitutes app. 43% of Norway's total coastline. The coastal heathlands of Norway, at the outlets of fjords or on the numerous islands just off the mainland, represents the northern one third of the total European Atlantic heathland belt. Even at the northern brink of their distribution, the ocean currents make for a mild coastal climate, dominated by high precipitation; 200225 days a year exceeding 0.1 mm precipitation, varying slightly depending on local topography. Average temperature for July varies between +10 and +14 degrees C, while for January it varies between +1 and -2 degrees C, hence some of the winter precipitation do fall as snow. Calluna vulgeris is usually the dominant plant species in these heaths. Characteristically, moisture dependent, northern and alpine species tend to blend in with the typical heathland vegetation. Such species are Betula nana, Arctostaphylas alpinus and Loiseleuria procumbens. In particular, Empetrum nigrum tends to constitute more of the heath as we move northwards. These landscapes have been an important resource for the maintenance of livestock, both in terms of grazing and harvesting grounds. Here, palaeoecologists and archeologists have found traces of early settlements and cultural influences in the landscape, dating back to the Stone Age. These traces show anthropogenic heathlands in the coastal regions of Central to Northern Norway; Trondelag and Nordland, as part of the prehistoric cultural landscape formed 3-4000 years ago. | ['maren', 'nilsen'] | ","['maren', 'nilsen']",2

Does the taiga flora follow the tundra pattern (Asian-American commonality of species as a result of continuity through the Quaternary), the temperate forest pattern (distinct species because of late Tertiary disjunction), a combination of these two patterns, or some pattern unique to the taiga? Location The taiga regions of interior Alaska and the Yukon in North America (the 'Alaskan taiga'), and the Kolyma and eastern Indigirka River basins in Russia (the 'Kolyma taiga'). The study areas include both forested and unforested habitats below elevational treeline. The two regions have similar climate and topography and were linked via the Bering Land Bridge in the Tertiary and for several extended periods during Quaternary cold periods. Methods Systematic comparison of the vascular floras of the two regions from published sources; and review of palaeoecological literature for the region. Results Of the 796 species found in the study areas, 27% occur only in the Alaskan taiga, 35% occur only in the Kolyma taiga, and 38% occur in both the regions. The following subsets of species show a high proportion of species in common between the study areas (subsets are not mutually exclusive): plants that occur on the tundra and the taiga, non-flowering plants, abundant taiga understory plants, and wetland and aquatic plants. A lower proportion of shared plants was noted for warm, south-facing steppe communities. No tree species are common to both areas. Main conclusions The Bering Strait region in the Quaternary has acted as a biogeographical filter for taiga plants. Significant divergence between northeast Asia and northwest North America has developed among the more southerly ranging fraction of the flora (e.g. trees), while the more cosmopolitan and the most cold-adapted elements of the taiga flora are common to both areas. Many plants in the former group have been disjunct between Asia and North America for millions of years, while many plants in the latter group have probably maintained continuity between the study areas via the Bering Land Bridge through much of the late Tertiary and Quaternary periods. Repeated extirpation of the less cold-adapted species from both study areas during Pleistocene cold periods has probably enhanced floristic differences between the two regions. | ['swanson'] | ",['swanson'],2

Yet studies on the subject in the Canadian Arctic have only recently been carried out, and the present study is the first in Nunavik (northeastern Canada). This paper documents the composition, characteristics, and origin of modern driftwood pieces on the beaches of the eastern coast of Hudson Bay. A total of 1057 samples from Ivujivik, Akulivik, Inukjuak, and Umiujaq were identified as belonging to four coniferous species (Picea sp., Larix sp., Abies sp. likely balsamea, and Thuja sp. likely occidentalis) and four deciduous species (Salix sp., Populus sp., Alnus sp., and Betula sp., likely papyrifera). Spruce largely predominate; white birch, white cedar, and fir are rare. The presence of the latter species proves that some of the wood originated from south-southeast of James Bay. Driftwood found in the southern area (Umiujaq) are more numerous, larger, and less degraded than driftwood in the north (Ivujivik). However, many large coniferous samples were found as far north as Akulivik, indicating that they likely traveled a great distance, unlike the smaller wood specimens (especially deciduous samples). All of the wood that we analyzed died relatively young, with an average age of 63years for conifers and 23years for deciduous.

Of these, 14 were frequent or at least locally abundant, including: Juniperus horizontalis, J. communis var. depressa, Geum triflorum var. triflorum, Carex richardsonii, Populus tremuloides, Elymus trachycaulus subsp. trachycaulus, Koeleria macrantha, Saxifraga tricuspidata, Artemesia campestris subsp. borealis, Senecio lugens, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, and Galium boreale. Of the trees comprising the surrounding forest, only Populus tremuloides and Pinus banksiana were common in the open areas. The cliff tops had fewer species but they also had some species of arctic and high boreal affinity that were absent from the alvars. Associations characterized by Deschampsia caespitosa occurred in lower areas of alvar that collect run-off, whereas higher areas were characterized by a variety of plants including Carex richardsonii, Elymus trachycaulus, and Geum triflorum. Cracks in the limestone pavement in elevated areas were occupied by Pinus banksiana and Juniperus communis. Approximately 12% of the species present were rare and/or restricted, including Avenula hookeri, Carex filifolia, and Dodecatheon pulchellum. Compared to the alvars of the Great Lakes region, the alvars and cliff tops of Northwest Territories had a much higher percentage of species that were also found in the Beringian region of northwestern North America. Higher numbers of boreal, arctic, and cordilleran species also contributed to the distinctive nature of Northwest Territories alvars, based on clustering of similarity coefficients from species presence or absence data. The alvar flora of Northwest Territories is believed to have been established in the region of Great Slave Lake between 10,000 and 8000 years ago, prior to invasion of the boreal forest. At this time, the northwestern Beringian and Cordilleran floras met the retreating tundra and prairie floras from the south in an expanding ice-free corridor. The relief flora of Northwest Territories alvars and cliff tops includes species of the Beringian steppes and tundras such as Plantago canescens, species of the central North American plains such as Geum triflorum, and many species that could have originated from the prairie-like habitats of either region. This unusual relict flora, originating in early postglacial times, is now isolated within the present boreal forest that spread through the region approximately 8000 years ago. | ['catling'] | ",['catling'],1

Holocene pollen data show a clear east-west increase to high values. A haplotype unique to the Scandinavian Peninsula is recognized. For eastern Beringia pre- and post-LGM macrofossils occur, but the LGM fossil record comprises only scattered low pollen values. Early Holocene pollen values increase markedly c. 11 cal yr bp (north-west Canada) and c. 10kcal yr bp (central Alaska). Also at this time three sites on the Bering Land Bridge indicate the presence of Picea where it is now absent. Several unique regional haplotypes were recorded; while most are rare one is common in some modern populations.Main conclusionsSmall Picea populations probably occurred in pre-Holocene Scandinavia, but pollen patterns argue against immediate expansion with the onset of warmer conditions. Despite relatively weak fossil evidence, refugial populations are also probable in eastern Beringia, particularly given the extent of unglaciated terrain. Post-glacial pollen patterns are more nuanced, suggesting two spatially and temporally distinct expansions, one possibly consistent with a unique central Alaskan haplotype, and subsequent westerly filling-in'. The presence of macrofossils and/or neutral markers does not require that current northern populations are derived primarily from refugial ones, particularly where pollen patterns show delayed directional expansion of large populations though time. Refugial populations initially responded weakly to major post-glacial environmental change; if subject to genetic isolation and strong selection pressure they may have had little potential to do otherwise, instead being largely replaced by in-migrating populations with greater genetic diversity. | ['armbruster', 'edward', 'elia'] | ","['armbruster', 'edward', 'elia']",1

The main species are larch (Larix sibirica (Ledeb.)), spruce (Picea obovata (Ledeb.)) and pine (Pirus sibirica (Du Tour)). Methodical approaches that allow the determination of the source of the wood and correct dating of the time of the constructions are presented. The tree-ring dating of eleven buildings and parts of the palisade highlighting four periods of construction activity during the second half of the 15th century (i.e. at around 1466 AD and 1475 AD) and the first half of the 16th century (at the beginning of the 16th century and after 1530 AD). The results determine that only two wooden structures were built using wood from local forests. In all other cases, the distribution of the dendrochronological dates and timber provenance indicates the use of driftwood from forests further upstream of the Nadym River. Thus, for a precise determination of construction activity in the Nadymskiy Gorodok settlement, a long exposure time of the driftwood needs to be considered and previous presumptions about the settlement history revised. | ['barinov', 'kardash', 'myglan', 'omurova', 'seim'] | ","['barinov', 'kardash', 'myglan', 'omurova', 'seim']",2

37,"Cooling in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and estuary region at 9.7 to 7.2 C-14 ka (11.2-8.0 cal ka): Palynological response to the PBO and 8.2 cal ka cold events, Laurentide Ice Sheet air-mass circulation and enhanced freshwater runoff | An examination of post-Younger Dryas (YD) pollen stratigraphies in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence estuary region reveals features in the pollen records that represent breaks in the normal vegetation succession, widespread vegetation suppression, and a delay in migration of plant taxa between 9.7 and 7.2 C-14 ka (11.2 and 8.0 cat ka). The domination of Alnus crispa at sites bordering the St. Lawrence estuary-Gutf region in Gaspesie and northern New Brunswick within this timeframe represents a diversion from the typical vegetation progression from Picea and/or Populus or Picea/Betula to Pinus and/or Betula, and signifies a shift to a cooler, drier climate. Coinciding with the A. crispa expansion and domination in that region was the contraction of Picea populations in other areas. In southwestern New Brunswick and eastern and southeastern Nova Scotia, Picea was replaced by the first appearance of tree birch, B. whereas in western and southwestern Newfoundland, Picea gave way to a resurgence of shrub birch, Betula glandulosa. The Picea contraction and immediate resurgence of Betula represents Cooling, and is reliably dated at 9720 +/- 110 C-14 BP (10,800-11,240 cat BP) in southwest Newfoundland. This first post-YD episode of widespread cooling is correlated with the North Atlantic Preboreal Oscillation (PBO) centered around 9650 +/- C-14 BP (10,900 - 11,180 cat BP) in the adjacent Great Lakes region. Sites exposed to winds from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and northern Nova Scotia show a lingering persistence of Picea and delay in arrival of Pinus to 8.0 and 7.7 C-14 ka (9.0 and 8.4 cat ka), yet Pinus was dominant as early as 9.4 C-14 ka (10.6 cat ka) in southwestem New Brunswick. At the same time, tundra vegetation persisted at high elevations in western and southwestern Newfoundland only to be replaced by upslope migration of shrub-birch heath by 8 C-14 ka. Prolonged broad-scale cooling to 8 C-14 ka and to as late as 7.7 C-14 ka extended up to 200 km inland in areas exposed to the St. Lawrence estuary and Gulf region and was in response to strong, cold, dry anticyclonic winds coming off the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet in combination with enhanced freshwater runoff through the Gulf of St. Lawrence.The end of the period of prolonged cooling and onset of regional warming coincided with the diversion of western Canada runoff and Agassiz-Ojibway drainage to Hudson Bay and reduced effect or final break-up of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Several sites document a subsequent cold shift, that interrupted regional warming at 7650 to 7200 C-14 BP (8400 to 8000 cat BP), and which is variously represented by the suppression of Pinus and resurgence of Picea, sometimes with A. crispa (Quebec-Maritime region), or by an abrupt decrease of Picea and resurgence of Betula (western Newfoundland). This second post-YD cool interval is equated with the 8200 cat BP cold event registered in the Greenland ice isotopic record. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

38,"Corresponding geographical types of hemiboreal forests in North Asia: peculiarities of ecology and genesis | This study represents a survey of various aspects of the ecology and genesis of a pair of geographically corresponding zonal forest types West and East Siberian light-coniferous-birch hemiboreal forests. The physiognomic similarities of these communities cause an impression of their plant-geographical and syntaxonomical uniformity. However, they represent two different geographical vegetation types showing essential differences in ecology, floristic compositions and plant-geographical relations. DCA ordination of 70 low-rank syntaxa of North Asian hemiboreal forests and correlation analysis with climatic parameters, demonstrate the importance of special climatic regimes and the influences of Atlantic and Pacific oceans in the formation of floristic differences in geographically corresponding forest types in western and eastern parts of Eurasia. Results of bioclimatic ordination and chorological analysis revealed important geographical trends in the evolution of zonal vegetation types. In case of hemiboreal forests, two different directions of evolution were seen during the last paleogeographical period: 1) Selection of similar cold-tolerant types of life forms during the glacial period because of general fall of temperature in northern hemisphere; 2) Formation of fundamental floristic distinctions in the western and eastern sectors of hemiboreal subzone caused by differences in sub-Atlantic and sub-Pacific climatic regimes and increasing floristic isolation caused by mountains in the central part of continent. Despite the colder, arid and continental climate in the eastern part of Eurasia, East Siberian hemiboreal forests have stronger floristic relations with thermophilous East Asian oak forests than West Siberian forests with European analogues. This fact demonstrates the evolutionary importance of the factor of oceanity-continentality for establishment of specific characteristics of vegetation types. High variability of seasonal temperatures and precipitation is a distinctive peculiarity of monsoon climate determining general ecological-geographical conditions of the whole East Asian sector during the last millions of years. | ['ermakov'] | ",['ermakov'],4
39,"A Current Synthesis of the Northern Archaic | Notched-point-bearing artifact assemblages found in Alaska and Yukon have commonly been attributed to the Northern Archaic tradition. Although the term Northern Archaic is commonly applied to notched-point-bearing assemblages, its use has extended beyond original intentions. This paper reviews the formulation of the Northern Archaic as it is known today and compiles nearly 200 notched point sites in Alaska and Yukon to critically review the age, distribution, and material culture of this tradition. Radiocarbon dates from sites show that this tradition falls mainly into the range of 3000-6000 years before present. Sites cluster in mountainous areas within and beyond the spruce tree line. Microblade and burin technology appears to be important in at least 30 percent of assemblages. Subsistence revolves around caribou in all areas and inadequate evidence at present exists to suggest fishing as a major seasonal activity. | ['esdale'] | ",['esdale'],1
40,"Decay progression and classification in two old-growth forests in Atlantic Canada | This paper investigates the relationship between visually apparent stage of decay of coarse woody debris (CWD) and time since death of decaying balsam fir (Abies balsamea L.) and black spruce (Picea mariana [P. Mill]) in old-growth forests in western Newfoundland and in the Cape Breton Highlands (CBH) of Nova Scotia. These sites are two of the least disturbed old-growth forest locations remaining in Atlantic Canada. In Newfoundland, a total of 42 detrital samples were collected from downed logs and standing snags, of which 36 had their mortality dates determined. In the CBH, 50 detrital samples were collected, of which death dates for 44 samples were obtained. For both sites, samples represented all visually discernable classes of decay. In Newfoundland, these visual decay classes were separated by approximately 17 years for a minimum decay time of 85 years. In CBH, a faster rate of decomposition was apparent, with 12-year classes and a minimum decay time of logs of 60 years. Evidence points toward a climate-driven decay regime in both locations, with the longer time frame evident in Newfoundland thought to result from lower temperatures and fewer snow-free days than in CBH.

41,"Deglacial vegetation succession and Holocene tree-limit dynamics in the Scandes Mountains, west-central Sweden: stratigraphic data compared to megafossil evidence | High-resolution records of plant macrofossils, magnetic susceptibility, and total carbon content, complemented by pollen data, were obtained from a postglacial lake sediment sequence at alpine Lake Stentjarn (987 m a.s.l.), in west-central Sweden. Holocene vegetational and environmental changes were reconstructed from the data, with particular emphasis on the deglacial establishment of terrestrial vegetation and subsequent tree-limit dynamics. A short-lived pioneer flora with Geum rivale, Dryas octopetala, Empetrum nigrum, Ledum palustre, Saxifraga sp., Salix spp., and Oxyria digyna established locally following deglaciation at c. 10,500 cat year BP. The pioneer flora was out-competed by establishing Betula pubescens and grasses at c. 10,300 cat year BP. Subsequent local expansions of B. pubescens at c. 9800 cat year BP and Pinus sylvestris at c. 9200 cal year BP were followed by a temporary retraction of the birch tree-limit and a permanent retreat of pine between 8500 and 8000 cat year BP, accompanied by declining aquatic productivity and increasing catchment erosion. A gradual decrease in forest density initiated at c. 6000 cat year BP led to a retreat of the birch tree-limit from the lake catchment at c. 3500 cat year BP, followed by persistence of scattered trees until c. 2000 cat year BP. A mosaic heath vegetation dominated by Empetrum nigrum and Betula nana developed at c, 3500 cat year BP. Comparison of the stratigraphic data from Lake Stenljiirn with records of radiocarbon-dated subfossil wood remains (megafossils) obtained from adjacent areas during recent decades revealed a high level of consistency of the inferred tree-limit variations for P. sylvestris, B. pubescens, and Alnus incana. Chronological control was established by radiocarbon dating of terrestrial macrofossils and geochemical identification of a tephra horizon originating from the Icelandic Askja- 1875 eruption.

42,"Dendro-provenancing of Arctic driftwood | Arctic driftwood may represent a cross-disciplinary proxy archive at the interface of marine and terrestrial environments, which will likely gain in importance under future global climate change. Circumpolar network analyses that systematically consider species-specific boreal origin areas, transport routes and deposition characteristics of Arctic driftwood, are, however, missing. Here, we present tree ring width (TRW) measurements of 2412 pine, larch and spruce driftwood samples from Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, the Faroe Islands, and the Lena Delta in northeastern Siberia. Representing the largest Arctic driftwood TRW compilation, these data are compared against 495 TRW reference chronologies from the boreal forests of Eurasia and North America. The southern Yenisei region is the main source for recent pine driftwood at all Arctic sampling sites, whereas spruce mainly originates in western Russia and central Siberia, as well as in northern North America. Larch driftwood is, for the first time, dendroprovenanced to central and eastern Siberia. A new larch driftwood chronology extends the middle Lena River reference chronology back to 1203 CE. Annually resolved radiocarbon measurements further date six larch driftwood chronologies between 1294 and 2013 CE. Although being highly replicated, our study emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research efforts including radiocarbon dating, isotopic tracing and aDNA processing for improving Arctic driftwood provenancing in space and time. If successful, Arctic driftwood studies will contribute to the reconstruction of past boreal summer temperature variations and ocean current dynamics, as well as changes in sea ice extent and relative sea level over the last centuries to millennia.

43,"Development of stunted black spruce (Picea mariana) clones in the subarctic environment: A dendroarchitectural analysis | Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) is the dominant tree species across the North American boreal forest. In the northernmost parts of its natural range, the species thrives in the form of scattered or aggregated stunted clones (krummholz) in winter-exposed subarctic and arctic sites. In this study, we have examined the mechanisms and developmental sequence that allow the growth, maintenance and expansion of long-lived (several hundred years old to more than one thousand years old), stunted black spruce using architectural and tree ring analyses. The development of stunted black spruce clones is the result of the reiteration potential of the species through layering. Exposed snow-drift sites are favourable to layering because branches are maintained close to the soil surface; these site conditions promote layering through adaptive reiteration associated with dedifferentiation of growing axes. Because the lower branches are held near the soil surface and buried beneath the litter, the formation of adventitious roots is accelerated and facilitates the physiological autonomy of clonally-born units. Newly formed units with an expanding root system lead to self-pruning of inter-branch connections and physiological autonomy. The age structure of all physiologically autonomous units within a clone often exhibits an inverse J-shaped distribution suggesting a stable population of units with prevailing site conditions. The average life span of a unit was 170 +- 70 years, but individual units may reach an age of more than 450 years. The dynamics of establishment and death of units (fragmentation of layers) through adaptive reiteration is the mechanism ensuring the great longevity of prostrate clones. In the absence of fire disturbance, stunted black spruce clones can perpetuate indefinitely. | ['laberge', 'payette', 'pitre'] | ","['laberge', 'payette', 'pitre']",2
44,"Distinguishing prehistoric human influence on late-Holocene forests in southern Ontario, Canada | The influence of Native Americans on late-Holocene forests of North America remains a contentious issue, as it is unclear whether vegetation transitions inferred from pollen records are a product of prehistoric human disturbance. In southern Ontario, the adoption of maize agriculture coincides with neoglacial cooling, so distinguishing the relative roles of prehistoric people and climatic change in shaping forest composition requires that pollen records be interpreted in a regional context. In this study, we objectively identify pollen records from the southern Ontario region which exhibit periods of significant pre-European anthropogenic disturbance in the context of the archeological record. This enables a comparison of pollen records shaped primarily by climatic cooling with those disturbed by prehistoric human forest clearance. Our results suggest that regional-scale late-Holocene cooling resulted in a gradual and synchronous shift from deciduous to boreal taxa. However, forest clearance by Native Americans resulted in a secondary succession characterized by the replacement of late-successional beech-maple forest with ruderal species, grasses and poplar, followed by mid-successional oak and white pine. This transition consistently coincides in space and time with an increase in archeological records of human occupation. The method we have developed here to distinguish significant prehistoric human impacts could be applied to pollen records in other regions, or on a continental scale. | ['gajewski', 'munoz'] | ","['gajewski', 'munoz']",4
45,"Distribution and dynamics of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) at its northern limit in the James Bay area | A regional assessment of balsam fir distribution along a transect between 49 degree 30' N and 53 degree 30'N Suggests that balsam fir exists as isolated populations scattered across large expanses of Quenbec's boreal forest. At its northern limit, balsam fir is primarily associated with environments that have a low fire frequency, such as the coastal lands along James Bay and the shores of major hinterland water bodies. Detailed mapping of balsam fir populations, stratigraphical study of supporting organic soils, and age-structure data of forest stands around Duncan Lake (53 degree 30'N, 78 degree w) constituted the core of the local analysis of balsam fir ecology at its northern limit. The presence of macrofossils in a representative organic soil profile of the spruce-fir forests of the Duncan Lake area suggests that balsam fir is present in the region since 3830 years BP. Its scarcity in the peat profile indicates a low population density during much of the site history. Age-structure analysis indicates the four spruce-fir forests studied in the Duncan Lake area are old-growth, dating back to at least the 17th or 18th centuries. Balsam fir behaves like a late successional species, appearing 100-150 years after black spruce in each site. Layering started during the 19th century, and became the principal means of regeneration for both species during the 20th century. The correlation between age frequency distribution and negative exponential model estimates ranges from 0.57-0.93 for balsam fir, and 0.930.95 for black spruce. The distribution of residuals along the regression slope suggests a period of low black spruce recruitment between ca 1860-1930; this was followed by a sharp increase until ca 1970. Balsam fir followed a similar, though delayed, pattern. The results suggest that marginal spruce-fir communities in the Duncan Lake area have experienced accelerated layering during the 20th century. Because few dead fir trees were found in the field, this may represent a long-ten-n increase in fir population densities. Increased snow fall since the turn of the century may have favoured the growth of Sphagnum and the rooting of basal branches; this has resulted in a continuous increase in population density. | ['sirois'] | ",['sirois'],2

47,"Dynamics of East European modern amphibian and reptile species distribution areas and their potential use in Quaternary stratigraphy | The last appearance dates and especially occurrences of amphibian and reptile species have a rather limited stratigraphic potential in Quaternary deposits. However, changes in their areas of distribution against the background of climate variations open some possibilities for biostratigraphy. Based on fossil assemblages of amphibians and reptiles, interglacial or periglacial conditions can be distinguished. Substitution of forest associations by those typical for forest-steppes or steppes within the limits of the modern forest zone can be attributed to climate aridization at the onset of a glaciation. Therefore, during paleogeographic reconstructions, it is important to determine a natural zone, instead of an assortment of possible biotopes. Glacial intervals for modern steppe zones can theoretically be visualized by the emergence of desert taxa. Distribution areas of amphibians and reptiles during interglacial optima show different outlines. They usually varied slightly, but sometimes the range of some species expanded (Bufotes viridis) or species disappeared (Strauchbufo raddei) from a large part of their original distribution. Such changes can be used to define large age intervals within a regional biostratigraphy. ¬© 2015 Acad√©mie des sciences. | ['ratnikov'] | ",['ratnikov'],2

49,"Early Holocene hybridisation between Betula pubescens and B. nana in relation to birch vegetation in Southwest Iceland | The aims of the present research were to gain better insight into the early Holocene vegetation history of Betula in South Iceland and to investigate whether hybridisation between downy tree-birch (Betula pubescens) and dwarf birch (Betula nana) could be discovered in this region, similar to that previously found in North Iceland. A peat monolith spanning the period from about 10.3 to 7.6 cal ka BP from Eyvik, Southwest Iceland, provided 44 samples for pollen analysis. The samples were dated by known tephra layers, Saksunarvatn and Seydisholar tephras, and two C-14 datings. The macrofossil and spore/pollen results showed several progressive phases of vegetation development in the area until birch woodland became established around 9.5 cal ka BP. The timing of birch colonisation is in good agreement with results from other sites in Iceland. From these Eyvik samples, all morphologically normal Betula pollen grains were size-measured and abnormal pollen grains recorded. Species proportions within samples were estimated statistically on the basis of pollen size. As birch woodland in this area became established rather late, statistical analysis of Betula pollen size was only possible in the uppermost 18 samples, approximately spanning the period between 7.6 and 9.5 cal ka BP. The frequency distribution of pollen size indicated populations of B. nana predating those of B. pubescens. The proportion of B. pubescens pollen was oscillating but increased with time. In two samples at the top of the peat monolith, more than half of the measured Betula pollen grains belonged to B. pubescens. Evidence of hybridisation based on high frequencies of non-triporate Betula pollen was found in two samples dated at about 8.8 and 7.7 cal ka BP. Conditions appeared to be comparable to the corresponding hybridisation events previously reported for North Iceland, i.e. in warm periods when downy birch was expanding near dwarf birch habitats.

51,"Early-Holocene vegetation of northern Iceland: pollen and plant macrofossil evidence from the Skagi peninsula | Pollen and plant macrofossil records from two lakes on northernmost Skagi peninsula, northern Iceland, reflect a progressive closing of the vegetation cover during the early Holocene. This development was connected with the succession from an initial herb-tundra phase characterized by Oxyria digyna, Poaceae and Caryophyllaceae, through an intermediate dwarf-shrub phase dominated by Salix and Empetrum nigrum, to a shrub and dwarf-shrub phase with Juniperus communis, Betula nana, Salix and Poaceae. This development is similar to that recorded at other sites in northern Iceland, both with respect to the taxa involved and the timing of transitions between successional phases, which suggests that early-Holocene vegetational development in northern Iceland was forced by broad-scale climatic changes. The palaeobotanical data suggest a gradual early-Holocene warming in northern Iceland, which probably was connected with northward displacements of Atlantic waters and North Atlantic air masses. The deposition of the Saksunarvatn ash at 9000 BP caused a transitory phase of vegetational succession on northernmost Skagi. | ['rundgren'] | ",['rundgren'],1

54,"Effects of Boreal Timber Rafting on the Composition of Arctic Driftwood | Wood from the boreal forest represents an important resource for paper production and sawmill processing. Due to poor infrastructure and high transportation costs on land, timbers are often transported over long distances along large river systems. Industrial river rafting activities started at the end of the 19th century and were intensified in western Russia and central Siberia from the 1920s to the 1980s. After initial single stem rafting, timber is today mostly floated in ship-guided rafts. Lost wood can be transported further to the Arctic Ocean, where it may drift within sea ice over several years and thousands of kilometers before being deposited along (sub-)Arctic coastlines. Here, we introduce dendro-dated tree-ring width series of 383 driftwood samples from logged timber that were collected along different driftwood-recipient coastlines in Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard. The majority of driftwood is Pinus sylvestris from the southern Yenisei region in central Siberia, whereas Larix sp. and Picea sp. from western Russia and eastern Siberia are rare. Although our results are based on a small sample collection, they clearly show the importance of timber rafting on species, age and origin of Arctic driftwood and indicate the immense loss of material during wood industrial river floating. | ['buntgen', 'hellmann', 'kirdyanov'] | ","['buntgen', 'hellmann', 'kirdyanov']",0
55,"Effects of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers on local vegetation in a non-uniform glacio-isostatic land uplift area, northern Sweden | The oldest early Mesolithic settlements found so far (i.e. 8600 B.P.) in the interior of northern Sweden, in the province of Norrbotten, have been discovered through the application of a model simulating glacio-isostatic land uplift. The objective of this study was to investigate, through pollen and charred particle analyses, vegetation composition and the influence of man on vegetation and fire pattern in the vicinity of two of these early settlements. Early Holocene vegetation was characterised by Betula, Hippophae and Salix-species, but no initial impact by hunter-gatherers on vegetation was detected. Subsequently Betula and Pinus became dominant but abrupt changes in the tree layer followed, Poaceae, Hippophae and Salix-species increased, and Humulus occurred. These changes, which were synchronous with dates of archaeological findings at the settlements, indicated local vegetation changes caused by man. The relationship between these changes and fire was, however, subtle. Eventually Pinus forests became dominant and human impact on vegetation became less apparent. It is concluded that the impact of early Mesolithic hunter-gatherers on vegetation was detectable, but that their effect on fire pattern was difficult to evaluate. Further, we show that the glacio-isostatic land uplift must be considered in the search for Mesolithic settlements in areas previously covered by the Weichselian Ice, and that the process has influenced the biological archives through re-deposition of material. | ['bergman', 'bohlin', 'hellberg', 'hoernberg', 'olofsson', 'passe', 'wallin', 'zackrisson'] | ","['bergman', 'bohlin', 'hellberg', 'hoernberg', 'olofsson', 'passe', 'wallin', 'zackrisson']",4
56,"The effects of snow packing on tree growth forms on an island in a recently created reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada | This study aims at determining the dendrochronological indicators of a changing snow accumulation regime on an island of a recently created reservoir in northern Quebec. Reservoir Robert-Bourassa (LG-2) is a vast lake (2,835 km(2)) covered by ice from mid-December to mid-May. Snow drifts across the frozen lake until it is trapped by obstacles on islands and at reservoir margins. Pre-established trees on the islands are negatively affected by the local augmentation of snow accumulation. Changes in tree growth forms of a severely exposed forested island indicate that damage occurred soon after reservoir filling. At the island edges, the decay of trees increases the wind exposure of border trees, causing massive foliage loss, thus reducing tree growth. Beyond the edge, in the island interior, drifted snow accumulates due to the wind breaking effect of the shoreline trees. Since reservoir filling, incidents of stem breakage, shoot bending and tilting, and branch tearing have increased due to snow packing. Such anomalous growth features appeared during the first 3 y after reservoir filling. Tree rings also indicate the trauma of wind and cold exposure stress. Such stress results in the incomplete formation of annual rings and the development of a series of resin ducts. The amount of snow packing damage to trees depends on the abundance of snowfall and on winter levels of the reservoir. The combination of these two factors controls the amount of snow reaching the island forests when drifted by the wind. | ['begin', 'tremblay'] | ","['begin', 'tremblay']",2

An initial oligotrophic lake was formed at the study site c. 9800 - 9500 C-14 yr BP. Although tundra communities dominated the vegetation in the area, birch and larch trees might have grown at lower elevations. Dry and disturbed soil habitats also occurred around the lake. Algae (mostly Pediastrum and Botryococcus) started to expand in the lake as climate gradually improved after c. 9500 C-14 yr BP. However, the role of mosses (mostly Calliergon and Drepanocladus) was most important for the infilling of the lake basin. Increased temperatures and subsequent improvement of hydrological conditions resulted in vegetation changes: stands of willows developed rapidly and the role of tree birch in the local vegetation increased. The lake was completely filled at c. 8600 C-14 yr BP. Peat accumulation started with Bryales mosses and, later, Sphagnum became dominant. Stands of Larix, Picea and Betula became well developed during the Boreal climate optimum. Tree birch began to spread into the tundra. Different Bryales mosses formed peat c. 8000 - 6500 C-14 yr BP. Cyperaceae later became the main peat-forming element. Dense spruce canopies with Larix sibirica and Betula pubescens surrounded the study site during the Atlantic period, pointing to the warmest climate during the Holocene. Summer temperatures might have been up to 3 - 4 degrees C higher than today. However, a decline of spruce and an increase of birch around 6700 - 6300 C-14 yr BP may reflect some climate deterioration. There are no dated deposits younger than 6000 C-14 yr BP. It is assumed that Subboreal climate deterioration resulted in the development of permafrost and formation of the palsa at the site. The deposits, now protruding above the surrounding terrain, were eroded by wind, water and cryogenic processes. | ['andreev', 'jankovska', 'panova'] | ","['andreev', 'jankovska', 'panova']",2
58,"Environmental changes on Yugorski Peninsula, Kara Sea, Russia, during the last 12,800 radiocarbon years | New pollen and radiocarbon data from an 8.6-m coastal section, Cape Shpindler (69degrees43'N; 62degrees48'E), Yugorski Peninsula, C dates document the latest Pleistocene and Holocene environmental history of this low Arctic region. Twelve AMS C-14 dates indicate that the deposits accumulated since about 13,000 until 2000 radiocarbon years BP. A thermokarst lake formed ca. 13,000-12,800 years BP, when scarce arctic tundra vegetation dominated the area. By 12,500 years BP, a shallow lake existed at the site, and Arctic tundra with Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Salix, Saxifraga, and Artemisia dominated nearby vegetation. Climate was colder than today. Betula nana became dominant during the Early Preboreal period about 9500 years BP, responding to a warm event, which was one of the warmest during the Holocene. Decline in B. nana and Salix after 9500 years BP reflects a brief event of Preboreal cooling. A subsequent increase in Betula and Alnus fruticosa pollen percentages reflects amelioration of environmental conditions at the end of Preboreal period (ca. 9300 years BP). A decline in arboreal taxa later, with a dramatic increase in herb taxa, reflects a short cold event at about 9200 years BP. The pollen data reflect a northward movement of tree birch, peaking at the middle Boreal period, around 8500 years BP. Open Betula forest existed on the Kara Sea coast of the Yugorski Peninsula during the Atlantic period (8000-4500 years BP), indicating that climate was significantly warmer than today. Deteriorating climate around the Atlantic-Subboreal boundary (ca. 4500 years BP) is recorded by a decline in Betula percentages. Sedimentation slowed at the site, and processes of denudation and/or soil formation started at the beginning of the Subatlantic period, when vegetation cover on Yugorski Peninsula shifted to near-modem assemblages.

59,"The Holocene evolution of permafrost near the tree line, on the eastern coast of Hudson Bay (northern Quebec) | Permafrost evolution in postglacial marine silts near the tree line was reconstructed using landform analysis, <sup>14</sup>C dating, and palynostratigraphic analysis of peat sections. In the forest-tundra, below the tree line, four sites in peat plateaus have a stratigraphic sequence indicating an alluvial plain environment from 6000 to 4800 BP followed by a wetland supporting trees and shrubs with deep snow accumulation and without permafrost. Ground heave occurred between 1900 and 1200 BP as peat plateaus and palsas were formed. In the shrub-tundra, above the tree line, three permafrost sites with buried peat beds suggest that climatic conditions were cold enough for discontinuous permafrost in the surrounding landscape starting from land emergence, about 5800 BP; however, fen expansion and sedge peat accumulation continued over unfrozen ground until 2300, 1560, and 1400 BP. At these dates, the sites were buried with silt, probably as a result of mass wasting on nearby permafrost mounds and then permafrost aggraded under the sites. Generally, the palynostratigraphic data reflect a marked cooling of climate starting by 3200-2700 BP and culminating in a major period of permafrost aggradation between 1900 and 1200 BP. Permafrost degradation has been dominant since then despite other possible cold intervals. Nowadays, the permafrost in marine silts is twice as thick and three times more widespread in the shrub-tundra than in the forest-tundra. | ['allard', 'seguin'] | ","['allard', 'seguin']",2

61,"The Fagus sylvatica forests in the Larvik region, south-eastern Norway: their origin and history | The origin and developmental history of Fagus sylvatica forests in south-eastern Norway have been studied through pollen analysis and AMS radiocarbon-dating of peat from two small forest hollows. In this area F. sylvatica appears to have a long history, from the first occurrence of F. sylvatica pollen at ca. 9100 cal. b.p. to its local expansion ca. 1300-1200 cal. b.p. At this time a shift from a diverse landscape mosaic with many plant taxa present, including broad-leaved trees, to a less diverse landscape mosaic with Picea abies and F. sylvatica trees is interpreted from the pollen data. The long history of F. sylvatica suggests that the existing forests are not recent plantations, but implies that these forests are native. The presence of pollen indicative of anthropogenic activity combined with charcoal before the expansion of F. sylvatica, as well as comparison with data from nearby sites, suggest that the forest development was likely to be a result of human activity and climatic changes, particularly changes in moisture conditions. | ['birks', 'bjune', 'helvik'] | ","['birks', 'bjune', 'helvik']",2
62,"Faunistic Cycles Extinction Expansion Extinction with Special Reference to the East Palearctic Dendrophilous Avi Fauna | The comparison of the present day dendrophilous avifaunas in Siberia and the Far East with the natural environment of these territories 19,000-16,000 B. P. has shown that these faunas could not exist in the major part of these regions at that time. Their formation took place during the Holocene and their expansion was mainly unidirectional. This suggests a recent faunistic vacuum which was due to the large scale extinction of forest birds, mainly of small insectivorous passerines of the preceding interglacial period. In Siberia the extinction appears to have been related to the degradation of forest refuges on the background of the very severe cold and arid climate of 19,000-16,000 B. P. The alternation of extinction and expansion determined the regional fauna formation for the East Palearctic dendrophilous avifaunas during the Late and upper part of the Middle Pleistocene. By the rate of species turnover, percentage of the species of southern origin, extinction of mainly small forms (r-selected species) and the negligible role of autochthonous faunaformation the history of dendrophilous avifauna of the East Palearctic appears to have differed markedly from that of the Western sector of Eurasia. | ['nazarenko'] | ",['nazarenko'],0
63,"FEATURES OF THE RADIAL GROWTH OF SHRUBS <i>BETULA NANA</i> AND <i>SALIX LANATA</i> ON VARIOUS LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS IN THE SOUTHERN TUNDRA OF YAMAL | Tundra communities are widespread in the northern part of Russia, in particular on the Yamal Peninsula in the registration of Siberia, where research was carried out. For the study, we used plants of the species Betula nana and Salix lanata, these species are among the most common in the southern tundra of Yamal. Sampling sites were located on various morphological elements of the relief with the identification of patterns in the distribution of natural resources that determine the radial growth of the trunks of Betula nana and Salix lanata. At each site, at least 30 samples of each species were taken to obtain a sufficient sample. The sampling sites were located on different morphological parts of the relief. In the course of the study, general growth trends are highlighted, as well as absolute values of growth for 5 years. This age corresponds to the minimum age of the selected plants. As a result, data were obtained on the distribution and growth characteristics of Betula nana and Salix lanata shrubs along the relief profile; the most and least favourable areas of the profile for the growth of shrubs were identified. To compare the general trends of radial growth, a faster slowdown in growth was found in Betula nana. In addition, it was found that the species Salix lanata has a stronger effect on mechanical impact (winter road). –¢—É–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤—ã–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω—ã –≤ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –≤ —á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—É–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–µ –Ø–º–∞–ª –≤ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏, –≥–¥–µ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥–∏–ª–∏—Å—å –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. –î–ª—è –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–∏–¥–∞ Betulanana –∏ Salixlanata, –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∏–¥—ã —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –æ–¥–Ω–∏–º–∏ –∏–∑ –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ —é–∂–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç—É–Ω–¥—Ä–∞—Ö –Ø–º–∞–ª–∞. –ü–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∫–∏ –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–± —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –º–æ—Ä—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç—è—Ö —Ä–µ–ª—å–µ—Ñ–∞ —Å —Ü–µ–ª—å—é –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –≤ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤, –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è—é—â–∏—Ö —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç —Å—Ç–≤–æ–ª–æ–≤ Betula nana –∏ Salix lanata. –ù–∞ –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–π –∏–∑ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–æ–∫ –æ—Ç–±–∏—Ä–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ 30 –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–æ–≤ –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞ –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–∫–∏. –£—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∏ –æ—Ç–±–æ—Ä–∞ —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –º–æ—Ä—Ñ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —á–∞—Å—Ç—è—Ö —Ä–µ–ª—å–µ—Ñ–∞. –í —Ö–æ–¥–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª—è–ª–∏—Å—å –æ–±—â–∏–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–¥—ã –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∞–±—Å–æ–ª—é—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –¥–ª—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∞ 5 –ª–µ—Ç. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –º–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º—É –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç—É –æ—Ç–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–π. –í —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω—ã –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∏ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è—Ö –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –∫—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω–∏—á–∫–æ–≤ Betula nana –∏ Salix lanata –ø–æ —Ä–µ–ª—å–µ—Ñ–Ω–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—é, –≤—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∏ –Ω–∞–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–µ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–Ω—ã–µ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—è –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è –∫—É—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω–∏—á–∫–æ–≤. –ü—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–æ —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–±—â–∏—Ö —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–¥–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–¥–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞, –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–æ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ –∑–∞–º–µ–¥–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ —É Betula nana. –ü–æ–º–∏–º–æ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ, –≤—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –≤–∏–¥ Salix lanata —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–µ–µ —Ä–µ–∞–≥–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –≤–æ–∑–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ (–∑–∏–º–Ω–∏–∫). | ['plotnikov'] | ",['plotnikov'],4
64,"Some features of vegetation cover of Eurasia in the earliest Holocene | In northern Eurasia during earliest Holocene (12,000-10,000 years B.P., after Neustadt, 1982) there was a great warming of climate. Especial role of it occurred on territories without ice sheets, where the warming was utilized by vegetation. As a result some species of trees and Alnus fruticosa were migrated to north. Alder had reached Bolshoy Lyachowski Island 10,540 +- 170 years B.P. It migrated also from Chukotka to Alaska. In reversed direction migrated Populus balsamifera and Viburnum edule. There are no data indication concerning the existence of the steppes or tundra-steppes during the earliest Holocene in northern Eurasia, because of the determination of spores and pollens only to genera and families rank (not to species). Many contemporary species considered as the steppic ones are in reality plurizonal. Xeric grassy vegetation of earliest Holocene, like of Pleistocene one, can be considered only as a pseudosteppic vegetation because of its scanty view. Different species of Picea were the first trees to colonize the territories freed of ice in the north-eastern parts of Europe and Asia. | ['kozhevnikov', 'ukraintseva'] | ","['kozhevnikov', 'ukraintseva']",0
65,"Holocene forest development in the central Scandes Mountains, Sweden | Pollen analyses of sediment cores from two small lakes within the boreal forest in the central Scandes Mountains help to elucidate the Holocene forest dynamics of the region. Analyses of pore/pollen grain diameter ratios of Alnus grains indicate the early Holocene presence of Alnus glutinosa in the study area. The results are discussed in conjunction with available pollen records to evaluate the importance of thermophilous trees during the early Holocene and to deduce the regional spread of Picea abies. Corylus avellana, Alnus glutinosa and Ulmus glabra were probably common constituents of the early Holocene forest. Tilia cordata may have occurred there as a rare tree. Pollen stratigraphies from the region do not indicate the occurrence of Quercus robur. The regional spread of Picea abies can be separated into two phases: a mid-Holocene establishment or first expansion of small outpost populations and a late-Holocene population expansion. The mid-Holocene shift in vegetation composition may have been caused by changes in the westerly airflow. | ['giesecke'] | ",['giesecke'],2

The samples were recovered from nine soil trenches located along an alitudinal gradient associated with a chronosequence as determined by the regional land emersion curve. The most significant gelifluction activity occurred after c. 2,800 B.P. Gelifluction events occurred around 5,600, 5,000, 4,500, 3,150, 2,500, 1,550, 1,200 and 450 B.P., and at present. According to the frequency of 14C dates, gelifluction has been particularly active between 2,800-2,300, 1,700-900 and 600-300 B.P., and at present. Gelifluction occurrence seems to be closely related to well-bracketed cold episodes in northern Quebec. The increase in frequency of 14C dates associated with burial of organic matter through gelifluction after c. 2,800 B.P. substantiates the cooling trend depicted elsewhere, both in nothern Quebec and in the northern hemisphere. | ['morin', 'payette'] | ","['morin', 'payette']",0
70,"Geographical and ecological relationships of the arctic-alpine vascular flora and vegetation, Arrigetch Peaks region, central Brooks Range, Alaska | The arctic-alpine vascular flora of the Arrigetch Peaks region is composed of a high percentage of arctic-montane circumpolar taxa. The flora shares the highest percentage of taxa with regions in central Alaska and Yukon Territory. Floristic similarity decreases both to the N and S within Alaska. The study area shares 21-34% of its flora with most arctic locations and with alpine locations in mountain ranges as far S as the Colorado Rocky Nountains in North America and the Altai in Asia. The family Asteraceae has the largest number of taxa in the Arrigetch flora, similar to alpine floras in the Rocky Mountains, but representative arctic floras surveyed had a higher percentage of taxa in Cyperaceae and Poaceae. Analysis of the geographical affinities of dominant and characteristic tax in the 43 plant associations dominated by vascular taxa in the study area indicated that well-drained and poorly-drained late lying snowbeds, subnival ridges, screes, S-facing bluffs, meadows, and calcareous and non-calcareous ridges are dominated and/or characterized by Beringian or Alaska-Yukon endemic taxa. These taxa surely occurred in the Alaska portion of the unglaciated Pleistocene refugium known as ""Beringia', and most likely occupied habitats similar to those they occupy at present. These taxa and associations occupy most of the stable sites in the arctic-alpine landscape, while circumpolar arctic-montane taxa are dominant on unstable valley slopes, cold and wet fens, marshes, and a few stable rock outcroppings. A large number of arctic-alpine tundra associations that are presently widespread in high mountains in the continental and semi-arid portions of interior and northern Alaska provide a reasonably good analogue of late Wisconsin and early Holocene vegetation that occurred in upland regions of the Alaskan portion of Beringia. -from Author | ['cooper'] | ",['cooper'],3
71,"Geomorphic response to climatic and environmental changes along a Central Asian transect during the Holocene | This paper discusses the geomorphic response to late Quaternary climatic changes, and to some extent, human impact, along an Asian transect running from Eastern Siberia via Mongolia and Tibet to India. The prevailing aridity of the Asian interior is controlled by distance from oceans and the existence of high mountain ranges, modifying the circulation of air masses. Another factor is the existence of permafrost expanding to the temperate zone. The contrasting characteristic of continentality are expressed in the asymmetry of present-day slope processes caused by differences in temperature and humidity. Differences in altitude generate altitudinal and horizontal zones. Late Quaternary climatic changes are reflected in latitudinal and altitudinal shifts in upper and lower tree lines, the snow Line and the permafrost limit. The warming trend in the early Holocene, gave way to cooling in the last 3-5 ka BP. This was accompanied by a rise in humidity which started (ca. 10 ka BP) in the southern part under monsoonal influences and later (8-7 ka BP) in the northern part under the influence of westerlies. Increased aridity was more or less coincident with the later cooling trend across Asia. In recent millennia, this has been accompanied by deforestation, cultivation and overgrazing, which have in turn, caused accelerated runoff and soil erosion. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

72,"Glacial populations and postglacial migration of Douglas-fir based on fossil pollen and macrofossil evidence | To understand how temperate forests might respond to future episodes of global warming, it is important to study the effects of large-scale climate change brought about by rapid postglacial warming. Compilations of fossil evidence have provided the best evidence of past plant range shifts, especially in eastern North America and Europe, and provide a context for interpreting new molecular datasets from modern forests. In western North America, however, such reviews have lagged even for common, widespread taxa. Here, we synthesize fossil evidence for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) from nearly 550 fossil pollen, sedimentary macrofossil, and packrat midden macrofossil sites to develop hypotheses about the species' late Quaternary history that can be tested with molecular phylogeographic studies. For both the coastal and interior varieties, we identified alternative hypotheses on the number of glacial populations and postglacial migration patterns that can be characterized as single-population versus multiple-population hypotheses. Coastal Douglas-fir may have been subdivided into two populations at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and colonized British Columbia from populations in Washington and Oregon. Interior Douglas-fir could have been subdivided along major topographic barriers into at least three LGM populations and colonized British Columbia and Alberta from populations in northwest Wyoming and/or northeast Utah. For both varieties, we calculated migration rates lower than previous studies, which could have been as high as 100-220 m/yr if Douglas-fir reached its modern distribution 9000 cal yr BP, or as low as 50 m/yr if it reached its modern range at present. The elevational range of populations in California and the southern Rockies shifted upslope by 700-1000 m. If there were multiple LGM populations, these elevational shifts suggest that those populations did not contribute to the colonization of Canada. Our findings emphasize the possibility of low-density northern LGM populations and that populations within species react individualistically in response to large-scale climate change.

73,"Global distribution of the European species of the lichen genus Melanelia Essl | Aim The global distribution of the European species of Melanelia Essl. (Lichenes: Parmeliaceae) was investigated in order to understand their distribution patterns against the background of ecogeographical and historical factors.The location of the study is global, with a local emphasis on Europe.Methods Geographical distribution and ecology of the species were investigated on the basis of herbarium studies and data from the literature as well as field observations. Distribution maps were created with ArcView GIS. The distribution patterns are expressed as three-dimensional 'areal formulas', regarding zonal distribution, altitudinal range and oceanicity, using a previously described method. The observed distribution patterns are discussed on the basis of their analogies with vascular plants and with respect to the ecogeographical vs. historical factors reflected by them.Results With the exception of one species that is endemic to Europe, all species studied occur in both northern continents. A number of species have tropical-alpine outposts, and two species occur also in extratropical zones of the southern hemisphere. Arctic and boreal distributions are circumpolar, while in the southern holarctic zones an affinity to the western sides of both northern continents is frequent.Main conclusions The distribution patterns appear to be mainly determined by contemporary ecogeographical factors. Most species probably have largely filled their potential distribution, at least within the Holarctic. Thus, the geographical origin and dispersal history of a species cannot reliably be reconstructed; they can be dissimilar in different species with similar distributions. | ['esslinger', 'litterski', 'otte'] | ","['esslinger', 'litterski', 'otte']",0

(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) outbreaks in northeastern British Columbia | The historical pattern of outbreaks of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), in white spruce stands in the Fort Nelson Forest District of northeastern British Columbia was reconstructed with the use of dendrochronology. Outbreaks occurred on an average every 26 years, with 5-6 outbreaks in the past century in the northern regions of the district, while southern regions experienced between 0 (the most southern sites) and 4 outbreaks. In the northern regions, outbreaks began about 10 years earlier and the period of defoliation was longer than in the southern regions of the district. The southern limit of the range of the spruce budworm in British Columbia is marked by the predominance of the Montane Boreal White and Black Spruce biogeoclimatic subzone that has cool and wet summers that may not favor budworm development. Therefore, outbreaks that begin in the more suitable northern habitat would move southward only when favorable environmental conditions develop. Along with the high number of outbreaks in the northern regions of the district, there has been no direct control of the budworm, and overmature stands are maintained through suppression of fire and lack of harvesting. Many of these stands are entering a state of general decline with protracted mortality, resulting from a complex of secondary insects and pathogens. | ['alfaro', 'borden', 'burleigh', 'taylor'] | ","['alfaro', 'borden', 'burleigh', 'taylor']",2
77,"Holocene history of alpine vegetation and forestline on Pyhakero mountain, northern Finland | Paleoecological analyses were carried out from two sediment cores from lake sites at the alpine treeline on Pyhakero mountain, the northernmost peak of an isolated mountain range, Pallastunturi-Ounastunturi, south of the polar forestline in western Finnish Lapland. Plant macrofossils, supported by pollen data, show presence of pine (Pinus sylvestris) and birch (Betula pubescens) on the top of the mountain from 9500 cal yr BP (birch) and 8300 cal yr BP (pine) up to 2000 cal yr BP (pine) and 1500 cal yr BP (birch). However, the major floristic elements of the modem alpine vegetation, as evidenced by plant macrofossils of a number of typical alpine taxa, including Salix cf. polaris, show persistence through the warmer periods of the Holocene, and indicate that the scattered pine-birch forest never completely replaced the low-alpine plant communities. The current low-alpine vegetation on the mountain top has therefore long continuity from the time of regional deglaciation. Dispersal of these alpine species took place primarily during the deglaciation phase and it is unnecessary to invoke dispersal of the arctic-alpine plants from the arctic regions of Fennoscandia during the mid- or late-Holocene to explain the origin of the alpine flora of the mountain range. | ['bradshaw', 'hannon', 'seppa'] | ","['bradshaw', 'hannon', 'seppa']",2

81,"The History of Spruce Forest in Norway under Exposure | Pollen-analytic investigations combined with radiocarbon datings of cores from a hundred sites, mostly ombrotrophic bogs, situated within the Norwegian spruce forest domain, reveal that the occupation of the areas by spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was the result of a protracted spread from east or northwest to west and south. The occupation started in the northern spruce forest province - further northeast in Lierne (Site 1), at the Bronze Age/Iron Age transition. A pre-Christian establishment took place also in the northeastern part of the southeast Norwegian spruce forest province (Sites 1, 2, 4, 8), and by the end of the Roman Iron Age the borderland between Sweden and Norway was occupied in its full length. The invasion of the southeastern lowland area started already in early Roman Iron Age (Sites 27, 28), but the migration up the valleys in either province to the climatically conditioned altitudinal boundary was not completed until the Viking period or Medieval time; at Orkdal and Rennebu (Sites 39 and 40 in the northern province) not until AD ca. 1500. A late establishment was recorded also at the coastal spruce forest boundary furthest west on the Fosen peninsula (Site 31). The late establishment at Voss (Site 62) - the largest spruce forest west of the Langfjellene range - suggests a spread, either natural or anthropogenous, from the nearest source stands east of the mountain range. | ['hafsten'] | ",['hafsten'],2

85,"Immigration of Picea abies into North-Central Sweden. New evidence of regional expansion and tree-limit evolution | Analyses of subfossil tree remains in peats and raw humus soils account for the immigration and spread of Picea abies (Norway spruce) into Sweden and the evolution of the alpine tree-limit ecotone. Picea abies is recorded for the first time about 11 000 BP, on an early emerging nunatak in the southern Swedish Scandes. Prior to c. 8 000 BP, Picea was strictly bound to high elevations in the west. Farther to the east in North-Central Sweden, Picea emerged in the subfossil record mainly after c. 6 000 BP. Later on, growth of local founder populations and landscape-scale expansion may have been forced chiefly by a successively less seasonal climate (the Milankovitch model of orbital forcing), promoting increased net soil moisture and possibly a deeper and more persistent snow cover. Already at the Weichselian/Holocene transition, an elevational tree-limit ecotone was established and arborescent Picea grew at least 400 m higher than the modern tree-limit. Until about 8 000 BP, the species-limit descended, whereafter it stabilized up to the present day. Lack of significant species-limit retraction after c. 8 000 BP may seem paradoxical in perspective of independently inferred climate cooling in response to reduced insolation and land uplift. This could be a consequence of substantial phenotypic plasticity and increased snow accumulation, mitigating the long-term cooling. Thus, the elevational species-limit (krummholz) of Picea abies is out of equilibrium with the modern thermal climate. The striking incongruence between the results exposed here and earlier palynological interpretations of the same biogeographical process will have implications for the use of pollen data for range-limit reconstructions within historical biogeography, and urges for re-evaluation of certain aspects of the Fennoscandian forest history. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],0

Immigration and spread (in area and frequency) were halted or retarded by the warming up of the climate, though Spruce never disappeared completely.

This is the first presentation of an analysis of the climate impact on the historical processes in Central Asia in the early Middle Ages. Climate extremes are sharp, strong and sometimes long-lasting falls of temperature with a negative impact on the economy of a nomadic society, often caused by great volcanic eruptions. As a result of the research undertaken by us, a certain connection has been established between significant historical events and climate extremes on the territory of Central Asia during the period under observation, which makes it possible to state that the climatic factor was of primary importance in its impact on historical processes in the east of Central Asia, especially on those territories that had a nomadic economy. ¬© IDOSI Publications, 2014. | ['ganiev'] | ",['ganiev'],0
88,"Indications of shifting cultivation west of the Lapland border: Multifaceted land use in northernmost Sweden since AD 800 | Permanent cultivation is generally believed to have been established in the interior of northernmost Fennoscandia later than elsewhere in northern Europe, during or after the late 17th century. Although subtle evidence from various pollen records suggests cultivation may have occurred much earlier in this region, such indications have generally been disregarded. We hypothesized that cultivation was introduced early in the Lapland border zone where western native Sami interacted with coastal farming societies due to the high degree of contact between these communities. Therefore, we investigated historical land usage at three settlement sites in the interior of Sweden's northernmost territories - two in the Lapland border zone and one in a more westerly traditional Sami area. Analyses of pollen, charcoal and written historical records indicated that cultivation first occurred in AD 800 (700-900) at the westernmost site and one of the border zone sites. Permanent cultivation appears to have been established in c. AD 1480 (1400-1560) and 1750 (1720-1810) in the two Lapland border zone settlements and around AD 1840 (1725-1940) in the westernmost settlement. These results suggest that small-scale shifting cultivation may have been conducted in inland regions of Northern Fennoscandia (including a traditional Sami area) since AD 800. As such, they support the hypothesis that intermittent small-scale cultivation has been going on in these regions for much longer than was previously accepted. Because there was a great mobility of people and ideas across northernmost Fennoscandia, we conclude that the current tendency to describe specific geographical regions as being solely used by nomadic herders' or permanent farmers' is inappropriate and fails to capture the complexity of historical land usage. | ['bergman', 'hornberg', 'josefsson', 'liedgren', 'ostlund'] | ","['bergman', 'hornberg', 'josefsson', 'liedgren', 'ostlund']",0

The carpograms given demonstrates it for the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Based on the data of dynamics of the species composition and its correlation with radiocarbon dating, as well as on the results of botanical analysis of peat, seventeen landscape-climatic periods in evolution of the ecosystems have been revealed. Three climatic stages in developing forest ecosystems were recognized. The first stage, 13000-8000 y. B. P., is an abrupt change of warm and short cool phases. During the warm and dry phases, grass larch formations with southern migrants prevailed; over cool phases, subtundra associations predominated. The second stage, 8000-5000 y. B. P. was characterized by relatively stable warm and wet climate. Dark coniferous grass formations with participation of southern and nemoral species prevailed. At the third stage, from 5000 y. B.

90,"Holocene Insects of the Urals and from the Center and North of Western Siberia | Data on sub-fossil insects from Holocene sites of the Urals, Pre-Urals region, and the central and northern parts of western Siberia are generalized. This work contains palaeontological material from 39 localities, most of them of alluvial genesis; the insect remains from peat bogs and zoogenic deposits have also been considered. Insect communities from alluvial sites correspond to modern entomofaunas from the same territories. The dynamics of insect faunas, which might have been associated with changes in landscape and climatic conditions, can be observed only at the borders of modern natural zones, such as tundra and taiga. The range limits of some boreal species seem to have moved northwards during the climatic optimum of the Holocene. No changes in insect faunas from the sites of alluvial and swamp genesis situated within the taiga zone have been observed, those insect assemblages being identical to the faunas of the areas containing these sits. Any changes in insect faunas in particular sections can be attributed to processes of ecological successions and the dynamics of local habitats. Based on spore-and-pollen data, no changes in plant communities caused by climatic fluctuations during the Holocene are expressed in the composition of insect complexes. This is demonstrated by taking two localities as examples: ""Lake Pereval'noe"" site from the polar Urals and Nyulsaveyto site from southern Yamal. The data presented in this paper generally correspond to those obtained over the territories of Western and Eastern Europe, as well as northeastern Siberia. However, at the same localities of zoogenic origin (pellets of birds, caves) we find some beetle species whose changes in distribution may have been linked to climatic fluctuations in the Holocene. | ['zinovyev'] | ",['zinovyev'],2

93,"Holocene land uplift and its influence on fire history and ecosystem development in boreal Sweden | Lake Uddjaur in northern Sweden was formed as a consequence of non-uniform glacio-isostatic uplift in which a forested valley was gradually flooded and high elevation areas became islands. We hypothesized that small islands in Lake Uddjaur burnt through lightning strike more frequently when they were part of a large forested area compared to when they became true islands, and that this reduction in fire impact has enhanced the domination of late successional species and humus accumulation. Fire history and vegetation dynamics were studied by analysis of macroscopic charcoal (> 0.5 mm) and pollen in humus profiles from two islands. According to a model of isostatic uplift, the islands became gradually isolated from the mainland between ca. 2000 to 1000 BP, i.e. during the same time that fire impact declined. Prior to that, both islands were part of a Pinus-Betula forest landscape affected by fires from ca. 5800 to ca. 1500 BP. Thereafter fire influence ceased and the islands became more strongly characterized by late successional species, e.g. Picea. This change was associated with substantial humus accumulation. The decreased fire influence on these islands contrasts with the regional increase in fire influence during the last 1000 yr. Long-term influence of wildfire is important in vegetation dynamics and humus accumulation and, thus, post-glacial isostatic land uplift can indirectly have a substantial influence on ecosystem development. Consequently, this effect should be further considered in long-time ecosystem studies of areas with large, non-uniform land uplift such as those found in northern Fennoscandia and eastern Canada. | ['hornberg', 'passe', 'wallin', 'wardle', 'zackrisson'] | ","['hornberg', 'passe', 'wallin', 'wardle', 'zackrisson']",0

During the studied period the species composition of large mammals was nearly constant and similar to the modern one with azonal species dominating in the fauna. The faunal composition of the southern part of forest-tundra zone differed from the northern part by the presence of the beaver and otter. Minor changes in the faunal composition took place only in the northern part of this area at the end of the Subatlantic period and concerned changes in the northern boundary of the sable range. It was controlled by the shift of northern forest boundary and the increased human activities. People completely exterminated beavers and sables in the region by the mid 18th century. The mountain hare. polar fox. and reindeer had persistently high numbers during the Late Holocene in the forest-tundra one. The numbers of other species were low.

96,"Large Scale Anthropogenic Reduction of Forest Cover in Last Glacial Maximum Europe | Reconstructions of the vegetation of Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are an enigma. Pollen-based analyses have suggested that Europe was largely covered by steppe and tundra, and forests persisted only in small refugia. Climate-vegetation model simulations on the other hand have consistently suggested that broad areas of Europe would have been suitable for forest, even in the depths of the last glaciation. Here we reconcile models with data by demonstrating that the highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that inhabited Europe at the LGM could have substantially reduced forest cover through the ignition of wildfires. Similar to hunter-gatherers of the more recent past, Upper Paleolithic humans were masters of the use of fire, and preferred inhabiting semi-open landscapes to facilitate foraging, hunting and travel. Incorporating human agency into a dynamic vegetation-fire model and simulating forest cover shows that even small increases in wildfire frequency over natural background levels resulted in large changes in the forested area of Europe, in part because trees were already stressed by low atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the cold, dry, and highly variable climate. Our results suggest that the impact of humans on the glacial landscape of Europe may be one of the earliest large-scale anthropogenic modifications of the earth system. | ['davis', 'kaplan', 'kolen', 'pfeiffer'] | ","['davis', 'kaplan', 'kolen', 'pfeiffer']",0
97,"The last European landscape to be colonised: A case study of land-use change in the far north of Sweden 1850-1930 | The agricultural colonisation of the interior of northern Sweden in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries can be regarded as Europe's last colonising venture supported by an economy based on self-sufficiency. Nevertheless, nomadic Sami people have practised basic economic approaches to resources and environment in this region for thousands of years. The aim of this study was to analyse the swift land-use transition, from nomadic to agricultural, in the last colonised landscape of northern Sweden. Using historical documents and maps together with modern maps and a field survey, we wanted to link land-use patterns as strongly as possible to landscape features and ecosystems. Resource use of farmers and the native Samis showed many similarities with some important exceptions. Some obvious disparities seem to have evolved, mainly connected to the animal species that were domesticated. With the Sami people involved and interfering with the colonisation process, their use of resources contributed significantly to local economy and land use therefore became intensified. Interestingly, in the studied area the main driving force for establishment of new settlements was commercial forestry. However, in the last colonised landscape, forestry reached its physical limits, leaving mountain birch forests with evidence of traditional Sami land use and Sami historical traces. ¬© 2005 The White Horse Press. | ['andersson', 't√∂rnlund', '√ñstlund'] | ","['andersson', 't√∂rnlund', '√ñstlund']",0

Our main objective was to test the hypothesis that a significant climatic cooling episode occurred during the late Holocene epoch, leading to the opening up of the boreal forest, and to the progressive replacement of black spruce (Picea mariana) forests by jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands. Beetle assemblages in the Radisson area were very stable during the late Holocene epoch. We used a total of 22 beetle species to conduct the MCR analyses. Reconstructed mean July temperatures ranged from 14.5 to 17.5¬∞C, which is close to the present-day (A.D. 1977-1996) temperature range found in the Radisson area. The general stability of beetle assemblages, and the MCR analyses, suggest that there was no major change in July temperatures during the last 5000 yr in the Radisson area. This study provides no evidence that the progressive replacement of black spruce forests by jack pine stands in the Radisson area during the last 2700 yr can be explained by a long-term climatic cooling episode affecting the postfire regeneration potential of trees. Consequently, an alternative hypothesis (more frequent fires favoring jack pine) should be seriously considered to explain the late Holocene changes in the forest environment of the Radisson area. | ['lavoie'] | ",['lavoie'],2

Our main goal was to classify the examined communities in terms of their zonal characteristics. It was shown that the most important changes in the fauna composition and structure occurred ca. 8000-9000 years ago; at that time the arctic rodent complex of the Pleistocene (which included only 3 species) was superseded by that of the forest-tundra type. The latter was composed of 10 species, many of which typical of forest associations. The process of the biota development in the region was strongly affected by the early and extremely abrupt arrival of the Holocene optimum first stage.

101,"Late Quaternary environments on the far southwestern edge of Beringia | Palynological and plant macrofossil data and remains of Mammuthus primigenius from the Tanon quarry (59 40' N, 151 degrees 12' E) provide much needed information about environments in southwestern Beringia during the Middle Holocene and marine isotope stages (MIS) 2 and 3. During the Middle Holocene, Larix-Betula forest characterized the Tanon region and differed from the Lath forests of interior Western Beringia. Betula platyphylla, which today is more common in moderate regions of the Far East, was an important component of the coastal forest near the quarry and possibly was more extensive in the coastal lowland. Ecological and quantitative models suggest that the coastal region experienced longer growing seasons and warmer summer temperatures, which could support the expansion of tree Betula. The MIS 2 palynological assemblage from Tanon indicates a prevalence of mesic and xeric herb-dominated tundra. However, the macrofossil data consist largely of taxa found in forest or forest-tundra with only a minor contribution by steppe species. The Tanon results agree with the larger paleovegetation database from Beringia, which suggests that steppe was not widespread during the Late Pleistocene but rather the landscape was characterized by a mosaic of tundra types. The Tanon site provides the first information about MIS 3 coastal vegetation, indicating the presence of Larix-Betula forest within valleys and shrub tundra at higher elevations.

102,"The late Quaternary history of lodgepole and jack pines | Pinus contorta and P. banksiana have pioneering roles after major disturbances such as fire or glaciation. These species are closely related and hybridize in W Canada, but their fossil records and contemporary variation patterns suggest they had completely different late Quaternary histories. Several taxonomically recognized geographic races of lodgepole pine apparently survived the last glaciation without drastic modification, the northern races either persisting in far-northern refugia or migrating from the south. The uneven influence of jack pine on northern lodgepole populations implies repeated genetic contacts, but less marked introgression in the other direction could be of post-Pleistocene origin. Jack pine occupied its entire range after the last glacial maximum and lacks taxonomically recognized races. In the Great Lakes region, however, the presence of regionally distinct populations suggests the species had at least 2 Midwestern refugia. This hypothesis is contrary to the widely held view that jack pine occupied most or all of its range from a well-documented refugium in southeastern North America, but is supported by limited fossil evidence that pine persisted in the Midwest during the last glaciation.-from Author | ['critchfield'] | ",['critchfield'],2

It is presumed that there was little difference between the potential distribution area of R. frangula and its actual geographical range because of its rapid spread during Preboreal and Boreal in south Norway. A small, temporary expansion of R. frangula occurred around 5500 BP in a mountain valley in western Norway.

104,"Late Quaternary Pollen Records and Vegetation History of the Southwest Yukon-Territory - a Review | This paper is a summary of all known late Quaternary palynostratigraphic records from the southwest Yukon Territory. Thirty two pollen sites available by the end of 1988 are reviewed. Most pollen records in the region are of Holocene age. During the late-glacial to early Holocene, the southwest Yukon supported a herb-dominated tundra vegetation which was replaced by a birch-dominated shrub-tundra at about 10,000 yr BP. Spruce invaded the area between 9000 and 8600 yr BP at different localities, and a southward time transgression is visible in the Aishihik Basin. The current regional vegetation has been stable since 7600-8000 yr BP when dense spruce forest and/or spruce forest-tundra was established in most localities. In the Snag area, however, dense spruce forest developed only around 5700 yr BP, which is about 2000 years later than in the Aishihik Basin. The exotic pine pollen records in the region exhibit an interesting pattern, suggesting a frequent shift of the atmospheric circulation system. Anomalous records of alder pollen from the Aishihik Basin and adjacent regions suggest that alder has never been widespread in these areas due to aridity, and alder pollen is greatly overrepresented in pollen spectra. Spruce arrival dates suggest that further investigations in the Tintina Valley, Yukon River Valley, and Carmacks region might provide useful information concerning the spruce migration routes. | ['geurts', 'wang'] | ","['geurts', 'wang']",1
105,"A Late Quaternary Vegetation History from Hanging Lake Northern Yukon Canada | A 403-cm core was recovered from Hanging Lake in unglaciated northern Yukon. Twenty-one radiocarbon dates indicate that the section is at least 25,000 and possibly 33,000 yr old; they permit the calculation of pollen influxes for the full-glacial in eastern Beringia. Numerical methods were used to divide pollen stratigraphy into 5 zones. From prior to 33,000 to 18,450 BP, a herb zone was dominant (zone HL 1) with high percentages of Gramineae, Artemisia and Cruciferae. However, the low pollen influx, ranging from 5-100 grains .cntdot. cm-2 .cntdot. yr-1, the low organic content of the sediment, and the occurrence of open-ground taxa all indicate that the vegetation cover was sparser than it is today. The arctic-alpine affinities of the herb pollen show that generically the vegetation was akin to modern arctic plant communities. Modern fellfield comunities in the northern Yukon and Siberia have a rich and endemic Artemisia flora and they can produce pollen spectra comparable to that of the herb zone. Percent and influx values for spruce, alder and birch increased slightly during subzone H 1B (21,680-18,450 BP); this subzone probably represents an interstadial. From 18,450 to 14,600 BP, a Salix-Cyperaceae zone (HL 2) occurred, suggesting the development of snowbed and willow scrub communities in shelterd areas. Between 14,600 and 11,100 BP Betula pollen dominated (zone HL 3) indicating the spread of dwarf birches, but the influx data show that this initial increase was modest compared with the subsequent zone and thus dwarf birches were probably restricted at this time to more favorable habitats. The spread of birch together with the increased total pollen influx, the higher organic content of the sediment, and the increased richness of herb pollen indicates that the local flora was more diverse and that the vegetative cover increased. The climate must have warmed. Zone HL 4 (Ericales zone) spanned the period from 11,100 to 8900 BP. Wet heath communities became locally abundant, poplar was more abundant at the beginning of this zone than at any subsequent time, the ranges of Typha latifolia and Myrica gale were greater than today, and pollen influx and sedimentation rate both increased greatly. Spruce became regionally abundant. These varied changes are probably in response to a warmer and wetter climate; they provide evidence for a late Pleistocene to early Holocene warm interval initially recognized by McCulloch and Hopkins (1966). Zone HL 5 (Alnus crispa zone) has been dated from 8900 BP to the present; it reflects the regional expansion of A. crispa on organic soils. | ['cwynar'] | ",['cwynar'],1

107,"Late Quaternary Vegetational Change in the Kotzebue Sound Area Northwestern Alaska USA | Two sediment cores from Kaiyak and Squirrel lakes in northwestern Alaska yielded pollen records that date to ca 39,000 and 27,000 yr B.P., respectively. Between 39,000 and 14,000 yr B.P., the vegetation around these lakes was dominated by Gramineae and Cyperaceae with some Salix and possibly Betula nana/glandulosa forming a local, shrub component of the vegetation. Betula pollen percentages increased about 14,000 yr B.P., indicating the presence of a birch-dominated shrub tundra. Alnus pollen appeared at both sites between 9000 and 8000 yr B.P., and Picea pollen (mostly P. mariana) arrived at Squirrel Lake about 5000 yr B.P. The current forest-tundra mosaic around Squirrel Lake was established at this time, whereas shrub tundra existed near Kaiyak Lake throughout the Holocene. When compared to other pollen records from northwestern North Ameica, these cores (1) represent a meadow component of lowland, Beringian tundra between 39,000 and 14,000 yr B.P., (2) demonstrate an early Holocene arrival of Alnus in northwestern Alaska that predates most other Alnus horizons in northern Alaska northwestern Canada, and (3) show an east-to-west migration of Picea across northern Alaska from 9000 to 5000 yr B.P. | ['anderson'] | ",['anderson'],3
108,"The late Weichselian and early Holocene history of tree birch in south Norway and the Bolling Betula time-lag in northwest Europe | This study compares late-glacial pollen data from northwest Europe to elucidate the northward migration of tree birch during the Bolling warming about 13,000 BP and the subsequent birch-forest development. The late-glacial tree-birch history in south Norway is emphasized. The Bolling warming initiated a rapid northward migration of tree birch, that extended across most of northwest Europe within c. 300 yr. Comparison of pollen influx studies shows that values of about 200 tree-birch pollen grains cm-2a-1 indicate local tree birch. The time that elapsed between the Bolling warming and the local birch-forest development, the so-called Bolling Betula time-lag, lasted up to 1000 yr, though in southern and/or protected sites this lag was about 500 yr or even less. In all areas of northwest Europe, strong winds are assumed to have been an important factor that delayed the birch-forest development in the first half of the late-glacial. Other important factors were drought effects in southern areas (e.g. south Britain) and sparse snow cover and frost in northern areas. The Arctic treeline lay in north Rogaland, southwest Norway, about 12,500 BP. During the Allerod Chronozone, tree birch migrated northward along the ice-free coastal strip of south Norway to More and Romsdal. However, the development of Allerod birch forest in Norway was restricted to Rogaland. The Younger Dryas cooling (11,000-10,000 BP) caused the near-extinction of tree birch in Norway, and only in sheltered sites in south Rogaland scattered individuals were able to survive. Hence, vegetational boundaries crossed Rogaland, thus representing an ecotonal area, through major parts of the late-glacial. A rapid development of closed birch forests all along the coast of south Norway occurred after the Holocene warming (10,000 BP). | ['paus'] | ",['paus'],2
109,"Late Wisconsin and Holocene Vegetational History of the Upper Koyukuk Region Brooks Range Alaska USA | Three pollen diagrams provide information on late Wisconsin and Holocene vegetation history at high elevation and midelevations (1000 and 600 m) in the east-central Brooks Range. After the retreat of glacial ice and until about 12,000 years before present, the vegetation was a tundra, dominated by Salix, Cyperaceae, Gramineae, Gramineae, Artemisia, and other herbaceous taxa. However, because the early pollen spectra do not have close modern analogs, the detailed composition and ecology of this tundra cannot be inferred. Between .apprx. 12,000 and .apprx. 8000 yr BP, Betula nana-glandulosa was the dominant pollen producer at both elevations; a significant ericaceous component was present in the vegetation of the alpine sites, but not at the lower elevation site. During the period 10,500-8500 yr BP, Populus balsamifera and Juniperus were probably abundant at the lower site and may also have been present at the higher sites, where they are now absent. Picea glauca, Alnus spp., P. mariana and Betula papyrifera became established at the lower site between .apprx. 8500 and 6000 yr BP. None of these species currently grows at the high sites, but their arrival at lower elevations is represented in the regional pollen rain at these sites. The arrival times of P. glauca and P. mariana in the study area are consistent with the hypothesis that P. glauca preceded P. mariana into the central Brooks Range. | ['anderson', 'brubaker', 'edward', 'garfinkel'] | ","['anderson', 'brubaker', 'edward', 'garfinkel']",3
110,"The Lateglacial and Postglacial vegetation history of the northwestern limits of Beringia, based on pollen, stomate and tree stump evidence | In order to reconstruct the Late- and Postglacial vegetation history of the northwestern edge of Beringia, a sediment core was collected from a lake north of the present treeline along the lower Lena River of northeastern Siberia, and analysed for fossil pollen and stomates. In addition, fossil tree stumps were collected in the vicinity of the lake. Eight radiocarbon dates indicate that the lake sediment record spans at least the past 12,300 yr BP. The early vegetation at this site was dominated by herb and shrub tundra. Possible evidence of Younger Dryas cooling, consisting of a decrease in shrub birch and increases in grass and herbaceous plants, occurs between 11,000 and 10,000 yr BP. Forests, dominated by Larix dahurica and including Picea obovata, extended northward to the site between 8500 and 3500 yr BP. There is an agreement between the pollen, stomate and tree stump evidence for this advance. The modern vegetation of shrub tundra was established after 3500 yr BP. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

111,"Lateral extension in Sphagnum mires along the southern margin of the boreal region, Western Siberia. (Special Section: Climatic and environmental change in Northern Eurasia.) | Although recent studies have recognized Northern Eurasian ecosystems as an important carbon reservoir, little is known about the forest-peatland interactions in a boreal environment induced by ongoing climatic changes. This study focuses on the evaluation of both the long-term and contemporary trends of land-cover changes and rates of lateral extension of peat-accumulating wetlands toward the adjacent forests, estimated at the southern climatic range of the Sphagnum-dominated mires in Western Siberia. We used the radiocarbon dates and stratigraphy of peat sediments from seven peat cores, analyzed at two types of forest-peatland ecotones, which are located close to each other but differ by topography and composition of their plant communities. The rate of lateral extension was found in a wide range varying from 2.3 to 791.7 cm yr<sup>-1</sup>. It was observed to be rapid during the initial stage of mire development, but to have slowed down over the last 2000-3000 yr. Our results, therefore, strongly contradict the concept of progressive peat accumulation throughout the late Holocene and contribute to our knowledge about ongoing land-cover change in the natural ecosystems of the Northern hemisphere. | ['peregon', 'uchida', 'yamagata'] | ","['peregon', 'uchida', 'yamagata']",0
112,"The Lemming Community on the Lichen-Heath Tundra at Churchill Manitoba Canada | During 1984, a community of small mammals located within an ""island"" of lichen-heath tundra in the forest-tundra near Churchill, Manitoba was studied. Dicrostonyx richardsoni shares the area with two eurytopic species; Sorex cinereus, Microtus pennsylvanicus and three Boreal species; Phenacomys intermedius, Clethrionomys gapperi, and Synaptomys borealis. Of the three most abundant species, D. richardsoni was trapped in the upland sites along with P. intermedius, and M. pennsylvanicus was trapped in the lowland sites. In comparison to other populations of the species, the Churchill population of D. richardsoni is residing in a community with more southern species of small mammals. The high density of the burrows, and the slow rates for peat accumulation shows that most of the burrows date to a previous period. D. richardsoni may have been more widespread during colder climatic periods such as the Little Ice Age. P. intermedius, C. gapperi, and S. borealis are not characteristically found on tundra and, therefore, may be recent invaders encouraged by the recent favourable climate. | ['hansell', 'scott'] | ","['hansell', 'scott']",1

114,"Limited stand expansion by a long-lived conifer at a leading northern range edge, despite available habitat | In an era of rapid climate change, understanding the natural capacity of species' ranges to track shifting climatic niches is a critical research and conservation need. Because species do not move across the landscape through empty space, but instead have to migrate through existing biotic communities, basic dispersal ecology and biotic interactions are important considerations beyond simple climate niche tracking. Yellow-cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis), a long-lived conifer of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest region, is thought to be undergoing a continued natural range expansion in southeast Alaska. At the same time, yellow-cedar's trailing edge is approaching its leading edge in the region, due to climate-induced root injury leading to widespread mortality over the past century. To examine the current dispersal capacity of yellow-cedar at its leading range edge, and potential for the species' leading edge to stay ahead of its trailing edge, we characterized recent yellow-cedar stand development near Juneau, Alaska, and surveyed the spread of yellow-cedar seedlings just beyond existing stand boundaries. Despite suitable habitat beyond stand edges, stand expansion appears limited in recent decades to centuries. Large quantities of seed are germinating within stands and just beyond boundaries, but seedlings are not developing to maturity. Furthermore, c. 100-200-year-old yellow-cedar trees are located abruptly at stand boundaries, indicating stand expansion is in a period of stasis with a last pulse at the end of the Little Ice Age climate period. Vegetative regeneration is common across stands and may be an adaptive strategy for this long-lived tree to persist on the landscape until conditions are favourable for successful seedling recruitment, leading to an overall punctuated migration and colonization of new landscapes.Synthesis. Species ranges do not always respond linearly to shifting climatic conditions. Instead, successful colonization of new habitat may be tied to episodic, threshold-related landscape phenomena, dispersal ability, and competition with existing plant communities. | ['buma', 'krapek'] | ","['buma', 'krapek']",2
115,"Long-distance pollen dispersal during recent colonization favors a rapid but partial recovery of genetic diversity in Picea sitchensis | Tree species in the northern hemisphere are currently subject to rapid anthropogenic climate change and are shifting their ranges in response. This prompts questions about the mechanisms allowing tree populations to respond quickly to selection pressures when establishing into new areas. Focusing on the northern expanding range edge of Picea sitchensis, a widespread conifer of western North America, we ask how genetic structure and diversity develop during colonization, and assess the role of demographic history in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of an establishing population.We combined 500 yr of tree-ring and genotyping-by-sequencing data in 639 trees at the expansion front on the Kodiak Archipelago.We show that alleles accumulated rapidly during an increase in recruitment rate in the early 1700s. A shift from foreign to local pollen flow subsequently homogenized genetic structure at the expansion front.Taking advantage of the exceptional longevity of conifers, we highlight the major role of long-distance pollen dispersal in the rapid but incomplete recovery of genetic diversity during the initial stages of colonization. We also warn that slow initial population growth as well as long-lasting dominance of local gene flow by early founders could increase evolutionary load under a rapidly changing climate. | ['aitken', 'elleouet'] | ","['aitken', 'elleouet']",2

Little research has examined the long-term and broad-scale history of MPB outbreaks, which is necessary to provide a baseline for comparing current and future outbreak extents. We examine the long-term history of MPB outbreaks in western Colorado, and analyse the synchrony of previous outbreaks across western North America.LocationWestern Colorado for tree-ring analysis; western North America for comparative analysis.MethodsWe used dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of MPB outbreaks since the 1700s in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests in Colorado. We then combined these new records with previously published data on MPB outbreaks to examine the historical synchrony of outbreaks across western North America.ResultsThe tree-ring record indicated that multiple cross-site MPB outbreaks occurred in Colorado lodgepole pine forests, initiating c. 1760s, 1780s, 1820s-1830s, 1860s, 1910s, 1960s and 1980s. Comparative analysis indicated that these outbreak dates coincide with documented and reconstructed MPB outbreaks in British Columbia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Utah.Main conclusionsSeveral subcontinental-scale MPB outbreaks have occurred in lodgepole pine forests over the past three centuries. Although the current study does not address the intensity of past outbreaks, it does indicate that previous outbreaks appear to have been highly synchronous across western North America. The subcontinental, rather than purely local, nature of these outbreaks is important for putting recent and future outbreaks of MPB into a broader ecological context. This study presents the longest tree-ring reconstruction of MPB outbreaks in the southern Rocky Mountains available to date, as well as the first subcontinental long-term comparative analysis of MPB outbreaks in western North America. | ['jarvis', 'kulakowski'] | ","['jarvis', 'kulakowski']",1
117,"Long-term changes in regional vegetation cover along the west coast of southern Norway: The importance of human impact | QuestionsHow open was the landscape prior to agriculture? Did agriculture start earlier in the south than in the north? How did the vegetation change in different regions after the introduction of agriculture?LocationCoast of SW and W Norway.MethodsThe REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites) model is applied for pollen-based vegetation reconstruction in 19 time windows over the last 9,000years. Pollen data from 63 sites (lakes and bogs) are compiled and systematically used for data analysis so that the structure of vegetation change in space and time is captured.ResultsEstimated cover of selected trees, shrubs, Calluna, graminids and herbs indicate a partly open outer coast throughout the Holocene. The highest tree cover is estimated for 8,200-6,200cal. BP. Broad-leaved trees (Fraxinus, Quercus, Tilia and Ulmus) spread from south to north and were present in the whole region at the end of the Mesolithic (5,950cal. BP). Larger spatial variation in tree cover and a step-wise reduction in deciduous trees after 5,700cal. BP is concordant with increases in open-land taxa indicating human activity. Vegetation changes caused by agriculture are indicated in the very south from ca. 5,950cal. BP. Distinct human-induced vegetation changes with spatial differentiation took place from 4,200 to 1,700cal. BP, when most of the areas earlier covered by deciduous woodland had been transformed to cultivated fields, grasslands and heathlands. Increased Poaceae cover from 1,700cal. BP probably reflects the expansion of mown meadows in addition to pastures.ConclusionsCapturing continuous changes of vegetation structure in space and time elucidates open areas along the western coast prior to the introduction of agriculture. Agriculture started earliest in the very south and spread rapidly along the whole coast prior to the Late Neolithic. Differences within the study area have existed in all time periods, reflecting different land-use practices adapted to different natural conditions. | ['danielsen', 'halvorsen', 'hjelle', 'hoeg', 'kaland', 'mehl', 'midtbo', 'overland', 'paus', 'prosch', 'danielsen', 'sugita'] | ","['danielsen', 'halvorsen', 'hjelle', 'hoeg', 'kaland', 'mehl', 'midtbo', 'overland', 'paus', 'prosch', 'danielsen', 'sugita']",0

Of the plants measured in detail, 70% had multiple stems (largest difference in stem age on a plant was 67 years), 54% had small epicormic shoots, and 59% had partially prostrate stems that could layer. The oldest stems were 35-114 years on alpine tundra, 47-48 years on river cuts, 36 years on moist tundra, and 16-33 years of floodplain. This species appeared to be reproducing by means of seedlings on 8 of 11 sites. Alder pollen percentages in surface samples from seven small ponds were negatively correlated with distance to alder stands. Pollen and 14C analysis of sediments from a pond near one sample stand showed that alder pollen percentages had decreased over the past 3600 years, but that alder had persisted in the area during this period. Estimates of potential plant age, dependent on assumptions about the production and survival of new stems, ranged from 100 years to unlimited age. The maximum age of stands is at least 100-200 years, but could be up to the 3600 years shown by a continuous pollen record and 14C analysis. | ['okeefe', 'patterson', 'iii', 'wilson'] | ","['okeefe', 'patterson', 'iii', 'wilson']",2

The oldest peat deposits were formed in a fen with many shallow pools between 5850 and 4500 BP. The flora was mainly composed of aquatic taxa (Ranunculus trichophyllus, Potamogeton spp., Hippuris vulgaris). Around 4500 BP, there was a shift from a very wet fen to a sedge fen with Potentilla palustris and Menyanthes trifoliata. From 3700 to 1950 BP, most plant remains were wood fragments of dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa). The formation of the palsa occurred after 1950 BP. The development of this peatland is similar to that of other palsa peatlands of subarctic Quebec, except that it is characterized by the presence of a thick peat layer composed of Betula glandulosa fragments at the top of the palsa. There were no black spruce remains older than 4560 BP. Three peaks of coleoptera abundance were identified at 4400, 3800, and 2700 BP, respectively.

Our fossil-tree chronology established from 66 radiocarbon dates of tree stems indicates that white pine and hemlock were present at the study site about 6000-5700 yr B.P. Hemlock reached a maximum 4900-4800 yr B.P. and then declined between 4600 and 3800 yr B.P.; the species recovered around 3700 yr B.P. and then decreased when white pine and eastern larch dominated the site after 3000 yr B.P. and between 2600 and 2200 yr B.P., respectively. Tree-ring signatures of fossil hemlocks suggest the continuous influence of biotic factors, possibly insect defoliators, throughout the record, as shown by recurrent suppressed-growth pattern.

124,"Methodological falsification and the interpretation of palaeoecological records: The cause of the early Holocene birch decline in western Canada | The use of palynological data to test hypotheses concerning biological interactions, pedological development, or climatic change is often based upon speculative assumptions about the causes of past vegetation change. In this study the approach of methodological falsification is used to investigate the causes of the decline of Betula in the western interior of Canada between 9000 and 7000 yr BP. The approach consists of the following steps: (1) determining the timing and geographic extent of the Betula decline; (2) reviewing information on the modem ecology of Betula papyrifera and the modern environment and late Quaternary palaeoenvironments of western Canada to develop a series of parsimonious and testable hypotheses regarding causes for the birch decline; and (3) testing the hypotheses using internal evidence from the pollen record and independent palaeoenvironmental data. This approach leads to the conclusion that hypotheses linking the birch decline to a pathogen, interspecific competition or progressive soil development should be rejected. The surviving hypothesis is that the birch decline represents an individualistic response to climate change. However, the process of erecting and testing these hypotheses demonstrates that great uncertainty exists in extracting the causes of vegetation change from palaeoecological records. | ['macdonald'] | ",['macdonald'],0

126,"Migration Patterns of Subgenus Alnus in Europe since the Last Glacial Maximum: A Systematic Review | Background/Aims: Recently, new palaeoecological records supported by molecular analyses and palaeodistributional modelling have provided more comprehensive insights into plant behaviour during the last Quaternary cycle. We reviewed the migration history of species of subgenus Alnus during the last 50,000 years in Europe with a focus on (1) a general revision of Alnus history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), (2) evidence of northern refugia of Alnus populations during the LGM and (3) the specific history of Alnus in particular European regions.Methodology: We determined changes in Alnus distribution on the basis of 811 and 68 radiocarbon-dated pollen and macrofossil sites, respectively. We compiled data from the European Pollen Database, the Czech Quaternary Palynological Database, the Eurasian Macrofossil Database and additional literature. Pollen percentage thresholds indicating expansions or retreats were used to describe patterns of past Alnus occurrence.Principal Findings: An expansion of Alnus during the Late Glacial and early Holocene periods supports the presence of alders during the LGM in southern peninsulas and northerly areas in western Europe, the foothills of the Alps, the Carpathians and northeastern Europe. After glaciers withdrew, the ice-free area of Europe was likely colonized from several regional refugia; the deglaciated area of Scandinavia was likely colonized from a single refugium in northeastern Europe. In the more northerly parts of Europe, we found a scale-dependent pattern of Alnus expansion characterised by a synchronous increase of Alnus within individual regions, though with regional differences in the times of the expansion. In southern peninsulas, the Alps and the Carpathians, by contrast, it seems that Alnus expanded differently at individual sites rather than synchronously in whole regions.Conclusions: Our synthesis supports the idea that northern LGM populations were important sources of postglacial Alnus expansion. The delayed Alnus expansion apparent in some regions was likely a result of environmental limitations. | ['douda', 'doudova', 'drasnarova', 'hadincova', 'krak', 'kunes', 'mandak', 'zakravsky'] | ","['douda', 'doudova', 'drasnarova', 'hadincova', 'krak', 'kunes', 'mandak', 'zakravsky']",1

The dendroclimatic analysis of the increment of older larch trees in the zone of the NMSC impact, implemented by the method of revealing the main factors influencing the increment, showed that since the beginning of the 20th century, the instability of the increment of wood has increased due to the sensitivity of this tree species to changes in the temperature conditions of growth. To assess the extent of forest damage, an aerial survey was conducted in July, 2003, as a result of which zoning of the territory adjacent to the NMSC was carried out according to the degree of damage to the stands: dead stands, severely damaged stands and moderately damaged stands. An estimation of the productivity of stands and the degree of their damage by landscape locations was made. The negative role of sulfur compounds was assessed and contemporary measures for sulfur utilization were described. | ['karbainov', 'polyakov', 'voronin', 'ziganshin'] | ","['karbainov', 'polyakov', 'voronin', 'ziganshin']",0
129,"Morphological differentiation of Betula (birch) pollen in northwest North America and its palaeoecological application | Lake sediments from arcto-boreal regions commonly contain abundant Betula pollen. However, palaeoenvironmental interpretations of Betula pollen are often ambiguous because of the lack of reliable morphological features to distinguish among ecologically distinct Betula species in western North America. We measured the grain diameters and pore depths of pollen from three tree-birch species (B. papyrifera, B. kenaica and B. neoalaskana) and two shrub-birch species (B. glandulosa and B. nana), and calculated the ratio of grain diameter to pore depth (D/P ratio). No statistical difference exists in all three parameters between the shrub-birch species or between two of the tree-birch species (B. kenaica and B. papyrifera), and B. neoalaskana is intermediate between the shrub-birch and the other two tree-birch species. However, mean pore depth is significantly larger for the tree species than for the shrub species. In contrast, mean grain diameter cannot distinguish tree and shrub species. Mean D/P ratio separates tree and shrub species less clearly than pore depth, but this ratio can be used for verification. The threshold for distinguishing pollen of tree versus shrub birch lies at 2.55 mm and 8.30 for pore depth and D/P ratio, respectively. We applied these thresholds to the analysis of Betula pollen in an Alaskan lake-sediment core spanning the past 800 years. Results show that shrub birch increased markedly at the expense of tree birch during the 'Little Ice Age'; this pattern is not discernible in the profile of total birch pollen. | ['clegg', 'gavin', 'hu', 'tinner'] | ","['clegg', 'gavin', 'hu', 'tinner']",2
130,"Natural Disturbances Regime as a Factor of Korean Pine-Broadleaved Forest Stand Shaping in the South of the Russian Far East | Using dendroecological approach we reconstructed disturbance history of a mixed Korean pinebroadleaved stand in the south of the Russian Far East. Our results show that during the last two centuries there were no mass disturbances, which may lead to canopy destruction and change of the tree species composition. The main drivers of natural dynamics of the stand were small- and middle-size gaps, and they determine current tree species abundance in the stand. We revealed 20-years periodicity in occurrence of trees growth releases, connected with gaps formation. The stand was formed only under natural disturbances (without Ô¨Åres, loggings and catastrophic disturbances) during at least 1000-1200 years. –° –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –¥–µ–Ω–¥—Ä–æ—ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥–∞ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è –∫–µ–¥—Ä–æ–≤–æ-—à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ª–µ—Å–∞, —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞ —é–≥–µ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≥–æ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞. –£—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –∑–∞ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏—Ö –¥–≤—É—Ö —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–π –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–æ –º–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø–æ–≤–ª–µ–∫–ª–∏ –±—ã –∑–∞ —Å–æ–±–æ–π —Ä–∞–∑—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∞ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è –∏ —Å–º–µ–Ω—É –µ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞. –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–æ–π –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ –±—ã–ª–∏ –æ–∫–Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–≥–æ –∏ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä–∞, —á—Ç–æ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏–ª–æ —Ç–µ–∫—É—â–µ–µ —Å–æ–æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–∞ –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –≤ –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ. –í—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –¥–≤–∞–¥—Ü–∞—Ç–∏–ª–µ—Ç–Ω—è—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —É–ª—É—á—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—å–µ–≤, —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ–º –æ–∫–æ–Ω. –î–ª–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏—è –¥—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è –∑–∞ —Å—á–µ—Ç –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–π (–±–µ–∑ –ø–æ–∂–∞—Ä–æ–≤, —Ä—É–±–æ–∫ –∏ –∫–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ä–∞—Å–ø–∞–¥–æ–≤) —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –Ω–µ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ 1000-1200 –ª–µ—Ç. | ['gusev', 'omelko', 'ukhvatkina', 'zhmerenetsky'] | ","['gusev', 'omelko', 'ukhvatkina', 'zhmerenetsky']",4
131,"New Data on the Natural Environment of the Middle and Late Neopleistocene Interglacial Periods in the East of the European Subarctic Region of Russia | The data obtained from investigation of the Middle and Late Neopleistocene lake sediments in the European Subarctic Region of Russia are reported. Chirva, Rodionovo (Scklov), Sula (Mikulino), and Byzovaya (Leningrad) sediments were subject to palynological analysis and investigation of particle size distribution and mineral composition. The spore-pollen spectra of the Chirva sediments demonstrate two climatic optima: the lower optimum is dominated by the pollen of Pinus sylvestris and broad-leaved species (up to 10%); the upper optimum is dominated by Picea sp. and Pinus sylvestris, while the pollen of Picea sect. Omorica and broad-leaved species are sporadic. The Rodionovo flora is characterized by a more xerophilous composition relative to the Chirva flora and a higher pollen content of pine, birch, wormseed plants, and wormwood. The climatic optimum of the Sula interglacial is distinguished by boreal vegetation, including spruce, birch, and birch-spruce forests with sparse broad-leaved species. The Byzovaya interstadial is marked by seven stages of changes in the vegetation: from tundra and forest-tundra communities to taiga forests with some broad-leaved species. The natural climatic sedimentation conditions in the Middle and Late Neopleistocene interglacial periods are reconstructed. The mineral composition of sediments was largely formed owing to underlying deposits. | ['andreicheva', 'marchenko', 'vagapova'] | ","['andreicheva', 'marchenko', 'vagapova']",1
132,"Neoglacial climate control of subarctic Picea abies stand dynamics and range limit in northern Sweden | The study focused on the performance of the spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) range limit in northern (subarctic) Sweden during the Neoglacial period of the Holocene, mainly after the climax of the Little Ice Age. Subfossil wood remains suggest that the geographic spruce tree limit has remained fairly stable for slightly more than the past 2000 14C yr. Previous postulates about delayed immigration and continual spread are contradicted in favor of a dynamic climate/spruce equilibrium. The mechanism restricting the spruce distribution was inferred to be severe annual ground frost characterizing this climatically continental and snow-poor region, which is crossed by the limit of discontinuous permafrost. An extensive (landscape scale) age structure analysis showed near-exponential population build-up over the past 100 yr or so. This manifested as densification of outlying stands and sparse range limit advance by some tens of kilometers. These responses clearly related to increased snowfall during the early (December) and late winter (March). In consequence, annual ground frost and permafrost declined in general, which made the least ground frost prone sites equable for establishment and persistent growth (less risk of winter desiccation) of spruce. These inferences are strengthened by tendencies for decreased spruce regeneration and vitality during the past decades, coincident with some exceptionally cold and snow-poor early winters. It is speculated that the structure and performance of the studied system, i.e. outliers checked by severe ground frost, is a small-scale analogy to the situation preceding the general late Holocene expansion of spruce in Fennoscandia. | ['engelmark', 'kullman'] | ","['engelmark', 'kullman']",0

A comparison of current data with those of 1920‚Äî1930s is given, a tendency of the larch to penetrate northward in the form of individual trees is observed. It is assumed that the larch elfin wood in the area is a remnant of woody forms which grew there during the Holocene warming. A comparison of the northern limits of the larch and <i>Duschekia</i> in the eastern Taimyr suggests that indicating species of the southern tundra in the area is the larch elfin wood, instead of <i>Duschekia</i>, since the limit of its distribution everywhere goes further north, with keeping within this subzone. –ü—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥—è—Ç—Å—è —Å–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–º –ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –ì–º–µ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ ( <i>Larix gmelinii</i> (Rupr.)

134,"Holocene occurrence of Lophodermium piceae, a black spruce needle endophyte and possible paleoindicator of boreal forest health | Holocene occurrences of conifer needle endophytes have not previously been reported. We report the fossil remains of Lophoderillitan piceae (Fckl.) Hoehn., a fungal endophyte of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) needles, in macrofossils dating back to 8000 cal yr BP. Spruce budworm head capsules and L. piceae remains were found preceding charcoal layers delineating the transformation of four spruce-moss forest sites to spruce-lichen woodland. As L. piceae is found solely on senescent needles, its increased presence during these transformation periods likely indicates that the forests were in decline due to the spruce budworin (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) when they burned. Future paleoecological studies incorporating needle fungi observations could be used to investigate the historical occurrence of tree disease and the role of fungi in forest health and decline.

135,"The old pine forest in Dievaidvuovdi/Dividalen - an ancient Sami cultural landscape | The old Sami tradition of collecting pine bark has gradually become forgotten in Norway during the last century, and characteristic markings on old living and dead pine trunks in and near Ovre Dividalen National Park, Central Troms, North Norway long remained a mystery to us. However, the topic has been much better studied in Sweden, and the present article presents both our own findings from Dividalen/Dievaidvuovdi and the long ethnobotanical traditions related to this activity. We have recorded 70 living and dead trunks with a total of 100 scars. Among these, 29 scars from 18 trees have so far been dated by dendrochronological methods, and were found to originate during the period 1619-1819.As seen in several illustrations, most scars are long-ellipsoid with an inrolled margin of compensatory growth. A photograph published in 1912 shows that they were originally broader. In the lowermost parts of a trunk, c. 0.5-1.5 m above the ground, Sami collected the inner bark during spring when it contained sap, using up to five different tools during the whole process. The bark was roasted slowly in subterranean stoves, and stored to be used as an attractive addition to several dishes. Etymologically very old names have been used about this tradition. This type of harvesting has also been used by many other northern, non-agricultural, indigenous peoples, and has been thought to prevent scurvy. During the pre-Christian period, bark was not harvested on the southern side of pine trunks, related to beliefs in the Sun God, whereas later harvesting took place on all sides of trees. Trees were never killed, but a tree was often resampled, often 10-15 years after the previous harvesting. The tree with the oldest datings in Dividalen had been harvested four times. From Sweden, scars of this type have been dated back to the 12th century, and a single scar has been dated to be c. 2800 years old. There, several symbols have also been carved into the scars. In Dividalen, the Samis Lars Person and Mard-Nils carved their names into a pine tree in 1748, still easily readable. An illustrated case with a circular scar instead represents harvesting for a different purpose. A circular piece of bark was put into a bag of a similar shape to store reindeer tendons, used for sewing purposes.The traditional Sami harvesting of pine bark was strongly critized by forestry officials about a century ago, often in a negative and colonialist style. Old-growth forests of pine have been strongly reduced. However, scars of traditional Sami bark harvesting can probably be found in most remaining primeval forest enclaves in North Norway, but probably not further to the south. Dividalen may represent one of the best sites, and is the Norwegian locality with the most extensive number of datings. Thus, what have been thought to represent untouched virgin pine forests, are instead old Sami cultural landscapes. | ['elvebakk', 'kirchhefer'] | ","['elvebakk', 'kirchhefer']",1
136,"The origin of driftwood on eastern and south-western Svalbard | The Arctic is one of the regions where the effect of global change is most evident. Associated with warming are changes in snow, sea ice and hydroclimate, all which have significant impacts on environments and society. However, due to short observational records, it is difficult to set the current climate in a long-term context. Arctic driftwood (DW), available throughout the Holocene, is a paleoclimate resource that may shed information on past sea-ice, ocean current and atmospheric conditions because it is transported by sea ice across the Arctic. Moreover, DW tree-ring data can be used to interpret climate in the boreal forests where the trees grew. Here we present a study of 380 DW samples collected on eastern and south-western Svalbard. Combining species identification and dendrochronology, it was found that the DW mainly consisted of Pinus sylvestris, Picea sp. and Larix sp. (87% of all samples), mainly originating from northern Russia. In total, 60% of the DW could be dated and their provenance determined, and four tree-ring width chronologies representing Yenisei and Dvina-Pechora were constructed, facilitating extension and improvement of the existing chronologies representing those regions. Moreover, DW from relict beaches that can be subjected to dendrochronological analyses, provides possibilities to extend pan-Arctic tree-ring data even further back in time. Because there are several processes governing the temporal patterns of wood deposition in the Arctic, using DW as an indicator of sea-ice variations needs further investigation. | ['buntgen', 'fuentes', 'gunnarson', 'hormes', 'linderholm'] | ","['buntgen', 'fuentes', 'gunnarson', 'hormes', 'linderholm']",0

The Late-glacial period (pollen zones I-III), with an open-ground vegetation of shade-intolerant pioneer plants, is only represented in deposits south of the Central Swedish Moraines. T o the north the forest, mostly of birch, is presumed to have migrated close behind the retreating ice in early Postglacial time (zone IV). Most of the Postglacial (zones V-VIII ) is characterized by luxuriant forest growth, favored by a comparatively warm climate, with optimum in zone VII . During the last part of the Postglacial (zone IX ) , or locally earlier, the vegetational landscape was influenced by the climatic deterioration and formation of raw humus and peat and was transformed through the activities of man. | ['fry'] | ",['fry'],2
139,"Palaeoclimate and tree-line changes during the Holocene based on pollen and plant macrofossil records from six lakes at different altitudes in northern Sweden | Pollen and macrofossil samples were analysed from lake sediments where the lakes formed a transect across the altitudinal tree-line in the Tornetrask area, in the northern Scandinavian mountain range. The results show that the tree-line, consisting of mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. tortuosa (Ledeb.) Nyman), was 300-400 m above the present during the early and mid-Holocene. When the isostatic land up-lift is taken into account this reflects summer temperatures 1.5-2degreeC higher than today. Expansion of mixed pine-birch forest took place 8300 cal BP in the eastern part of the Tornetrask area and about 700 years later in the western part at low altitudes. Optimal conditions for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) occurred during the mid-Holocene (6300-4500 cal BP) when mixed pine-birch forest reached 110 m and single pines reached 175 m above the present pine limit. The Holocene climate is interpreted as warm and moist during the early Holocene, warm and dry during the mid-Holocene, and finally cold and moist during the late Holocene. | ['barnekow', 'sandgren'] | ","['barnekow', 'sandgren']",0

A sediment core from Mezhgornoe Lake situated at the present-day alpine tree-line was studied for pollen, plant macrofossils, Cladocera and diatoms. A peat section from Vangyr Mire in the nearby mixed mountain taiga zone was analysed for pollen. The results suggest that the study area experienced a climatic optimum in the early Holocene and that summer temperatures were at least 2degreesC warmer than today. Tree birch immigrated to the Mezhgornoe Lake area at the onset of the Holocene. Mixed spruce forests followed at ca. 9500-9000 (14)C yr BP. Climate was moist and the water level of Mezhgornoe Lake rose rapidly. The hypsithermal phase lasted until ca. 5500-4500 (14)C yr BP, after which the mixed forest withdrew from the Mezhgornoe catchment as a result of the climate cooling.

141,"The palaeoecology of a treed bog in western boreal Canada: A study based on microfossils, macrofossils and physico-chemical properties | The developmental histories of a wetland and the surrounding upland vegetation in the southern boreal region of western Canada are traced through microfossil, macrofossil, physico-chemical and radiometric analyses of a 425 cm deep core consisting of sandy gyttja and peat. Microfossil analysis includes algal, fungal and zoological 'Types' which are illustrated and described, with notes on their occurrence as observed in several peat sequences of western boreal Canada. Local wetland development started in the central area of a 65 ha closed depression at c. 5000 BP, due to a rise in the groundwater table related to a gradual increase in effective precipitation in the region. Initial stages were characterised by Typha-dominated marsh communities that suggest marked seasonal fluctuations in local water levels. The accumulation of organic matter could not keep pace with the ever-rising groundwater table, and a shallow eutrophic pond with aquatic macrophytes developed locally. The body of open water was surrounded by marsh vegetation that was gradually being displaced towards the margins of the depression. At 4330 BP moist conditions became prevalent throughout the growing season. A brown-moss dominated treed rich fen replaced the shore marsh community and gradually began to encroach on the small pond. The basin completely terrestrialised at 3260 BP. Autogenic processes caused by peat accumulation resulted in a transition towards a Sphagnum-dominated treed poor fen. At 2790 BP a treed bog became established, firstly dominated by Sphagnum angustifolium and S. magellanicum indicating moist local conditions. After 1870 BP S. fuscum became dominant, indicating drier conditions locally. The upland vegetation just before local wetland formation was characterised by Picea in relatively wet depressions and by Populus in drier areas. Some grassland patches were present, most probably on the more southerly exposed slopes of the hills. Picea was locally displaced by wetland vegetation at c. 5000 BP, whereas deciduous forest and some grassland stands continued to dominate the surrounding hills. The coniferous taxa Pinus and Picea began to invade the uplands after 4330 BP, contemporaneously with the development of the local peatland. This marks the time at which the modern southern boreal ecosystem dominated by peatlands in lowlands and mixed wood forest in uplands became established in the area. | ['kuhry'] | ",['kuhry'],1
142,"Paleoecology of Pine (Pinus-Sylvestris) in the Swedish Scandes and a Review of the Analysis of Subfossil Wood | Subfossil pine (Rinus sylvestris L.) occurs in various deposits and in great frequency well above the current altitudinal pine limit in the Scandes Mountains. These tree remnants constitute a fairly continuous record of range-limit dynamics throughout the Holocene and offer excellent potential for palaeoecological as well as palaeoclimatological research. General aspects of this record are discussed, including the fundamental issue of the circumstances of preservation. It is proposed that throughout the Holocene conditions for preservation have existed at the fluctuating tree-limit. Hypothetically, temporal clusters and gaps in the frequency distribution of radiocarbon dates can fairly consistently reflect climatic variability. Tree-limit recession in particular may be rapid, in response to episodes of severe winter cold. Such events may appear disproportionately protracted backwards in time, due to frost-heaving and rain-induced erosion of deposits with subfossils.

More than 60 AMS-14C and conventional 14C dates indicate that the deposits accumulated during the last 60,000 radiocarbon yr BP. High concentration of green alga colonies (Pediastrum and Botryococcus) in the investigated sediment show that sedimentation was mostly in shallow water environments. Scarce grass and sedge communities dominated the vegetation 53-60 kyr BP. Climate was cold and dry. Open Poaceae and Cyperaceae associations with Asteraceae, Ranunculaceae, and Cichoriaceae. dominated in the area about 48-42.5 kyr BP. Steppic communities with Artemisia and shrubby tundra communities with Salix and Betula sect. Nanae were also present. Climate was dry, but relatively warm. Vegetation cover became denser about 42.5-33.5 kyr BP, reflecting more favorable climate conditions. Scarce Poaceae communities with some Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae. Cichoriaceae, and Selaginella rupestris covered the Bykovsky Peninsula area during the Sartan (Late Weichselian) stage about 26-16 kyr BP. Disturbed, uncovered soils were very common in the area. Climate was extremely cold and dry. Poaceae and Cyperaceae associations with Caryophyllaceae. Asteraceae. Cichoriaceae dominated the vegetation in the late Sartan. ca 16-12.2 kyr BP. Climate was significantly warmer than in the early Sartan time. The Ice Complex sedimentation was interrupted about 12 kyr BP; most likely it was connected with the beginning of the Allered warming. Shrubby (Betula sect. Nanae, Alnus fruticosa, Salix, Ericales) tundra was widely distributed on the Bykovsky Peninsula during the early-middle Holocene. Climate was most favorable between 8200 and 4500 yr BP.

144,"Paleography of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene of the Novaya River Basin Taimyr National Okrug Russian-Sfsr Ussr | On the basis of geological, geomorphological and palynological analyses of Pleistocene and Holocene deposits (focusing on material from the following spp.: Larix sp., L. cf. gmelinii, Picea obovata, Betula alba s.l., Betula exilis, Betula sp. ex sect. Fruticosae, B. sp. ex sect. Nanae, Betula spp., Alnaster fruticosa, Salix spp., Lycopodium alpinum, L. inundatum, Bryales sp., Sphagnum sp., Polypodiaceae), it was established that a rhythmic shift occurred in the conditions of sedimentation, climate and vegetative cover found in the basin of the river Novaya in eastern Taimyr within the last 30,000 yr. Despite the planetary improvement in climate during the Karginskian and the climatic optimum of the Holocene, ecological conditions varied in many places and served to control the advance of forests toward the north. The most favorable physico-geographic conditions in the subarctic region for the maximal shift of natural zones to the north were in the central northern Siberian depression; this was brought about by the inland position of the territory and its flatland character. Anomalously high temperatures for such latitudes, combined with increased humidity, served to induce the development of forest landscapes in the eastern Taimyr, even in the pre-Sartanian phase of the Karginskian thaw. | ['belorusova', 'zh', 'ukraintseva'] | ","['belorusova', 'zh', 'ukraintseva']",1

146,"Paleopalinological survey of soils of the European north-east of Russia having complex organic profile C3 - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science | The genesis of the soils having second humus horizon in the North-East of the European part of Russia was considered in the paper. The theory of the relict origin of the second humus horizon in sod-podzolic soils was confirmed on the basis of paleopalynological analysis. Data of paleopalinological study of sod-podzolic soils with complex organic profile are presented. In these soils, the remains of the relict humus horizon, which formed in the warmer Atlantic period of the Holocene under broad-leaved forests, have been preserved. It was revealed that despite the significant degree of destruction of the relict horizon, paleomorphs (pollen and plant spores) were preserved in it, which formed phytocenoses of broad-leaved forests. During the optimal period of the Holocene, the northern boundary of the spread of phytocenoses of coniferous-deciduous forests within the borders of the modern Kirov region of Russia presumably passed north of 58 degrees north latitude. Currently, in the region, broad-leaved forests in natural conditions have been preserved south of 56 degrees north latitude. The results will clarify the species composition of vegetation and the history of landscape development in the Kirov region of Russia in the Holocene. ¬© 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

147,"Palynological Evidence for Postglacial Change in the Position of Tree Limit in Labrador Canada | The postglacial history of the forest-tundra zone in Labrador is inferred from the pollen stratigraphy of sediment cores from 4 lakes which differ considerably in the size and relative relief of their hydrologic catchments. Local pollen-assemblage zones are established independently for each pollen sequence by numerical methods. The relative pollen stratigraphies, interpreted through multivariate statistical comparison with modern pollen spectra from the region, show an overall increase in the tundra component of the forest-tundra vegetation since .apprxeq. 3000 BP. Decreasing absolute frequencies of Picea pollen in the sediments are interpreted as evidence of the decline in tree numbers within the lake catchments, and therefore as a potential record of lowering of the altitudinal tree limit. The records show diachronous changes between sites because of differences in catchment elevation and relief. Tree limit has apparently fallen at least 40 m between 3000 and 1000 BP. A further fall of 30 m may have taken place by 250 BP. High ground in northern Labrador makes it unlikely that any equivalent southward displacement of latitudinal tree line can be identified. | ['lamb'] | ",['lamb'],0
148,"The palynological record of Late-Quaternary arctic tree-line in northwest Canada | The palynological records of arctic tree-lines in North America give clear evidence of large scale northward displacement of the forest limit during the early Holocene. However, small scale or local changes in forests that occurred during the mid or late Holocene have been more difficult to detect using pollen analysis. A grid of sites from the region to the east of the MacKenzie Delta, N.W.T., provides a good temporal and spatial record of tree-line (forest) movements. Detailed pollen and macrofossil analyses at three sites, Reindeer Lake, Sleet Lake and Bluffer's Pingo, which lie 50, 75, and 100 km north of the modern forest limit, respectively, provide a detailed paleoecological record. The evidence indicates that the northward displacement of forests in the early Holocene from 10,000 to 8400 yr BP was not simply a northward shift of trees but that a complex pattern of vegetation developed with white spruce populations growing north of open poplar stands. Open woodlands with black spruce grew as far north as Sleet Lake from 8400 to 3500 yr BP. These woodlands gradually retreated to just south of Reindeer Lake during the late Holocene. | ['spear'] | ",['spear'],2

151,"Pathways for Fauna Formation of the Solovetsky Archipelago, White Sea, Northwestern Russia | The fauna of the Solovetslcy Archipelago represents an extremely impoverished and reduced variant of the continental northern boreal one. The level of its impoverishment roughly corresponds to a latitudinal shift by one or two nature subzones, that is, by the number of species it is comparable to mainland local faunas of the forested tundra or hypoarctic tundra. Only very few arctic species, let alone more southern (nemoral) faunal elements occur on the archipelago. The compositions of the basic fauna groups and their dominant species are determined thereby three main factors: a wide distribution of intrazonal ecosystems (coastal heathlands and grasslands, birch sparse forests, peat bogs), a limited living space and extreme climatic conditions. Among the dominants are eurytopic polyzonal and, to a lesser degree, hypoarctic species. The isolation of Solovetsky Islands is no significant barrier to the dispersal of numerous animal species, but these islands form the highly specific environment that strongly prevents the invasion of new species lacking relevant preadaptations to local habitat and climatic conditions. The effect of ""density compensation"" in response to a lower taxonomic diversity is revealed in the archipelago in numerous taxonomic groups, thereby the mass species spectrum can vary considerably with time depending on climatic conditions. The Solovetsky Islands' fauna is originally continental in origin, having mainly been formed in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (similar to 9-10 ka before present). | ['bolotov'] | ",['bolotov'],2

New data from N Alberta and the Northwest Territories show that white spruce spread across the 2000 km from S-central Alberta to the Mackenzie Delta area during c1000 yr. Analysis of fossil dunes in northwest Saskatchewan and a recent palaeoclimate simulation experiment provide a possible explanation, as both propose that surface winds in the Western Interior had a strong southern component at c9000 yr BP.

154,"On peculiarities of the flora of the 'erratic region' | Krashennikov's studies of the complex Siberian Pleistocene flora of the Southern Urals yielded schematic pictures of the distribution and floristic compositions of Pre-Ural and Southern Ural vegetation in phases of the Pleistocene and Holocene periods. Kleopova analysed the history of broadleaved forests in the European U.S.S.R. fro the beginning of the Pleistocene period and defined the influence of recurring glacial and interglacial periods. In northeastern Europe the floristic history of the whole area was governed by alternating glacial and interglacial periods and short climatic changes in postglacial times. Towards the end of the Pliocene the ranges of many species were reduced or split up. Some species isolated at the beginning of the Pleistocene continued to exist in localities sheltered from glacial conditions and became adapted to the diverging conditions of their several habitats. Widespread migrations occurred into ice-free territory from west to east and south, and also from the isolated habitats. As a result of covering migration over very long periods and on a vast territory open to all comers, hybridization was frequent and widespread. Examples of reciprocal hybridization as a result of migrational encounters in the Middle Volga region occur in Primula officinalis. Pulsatilla patens, Rosa cinnamomea, Picea excelsa [P. abies] and Tilia septentrionalis. Each of these species is discussed in detail and the author suggests that these forms should be recognized by binary nomenclature indicating geographical origin, thus the Spruce of the Middle Volga is not Picea excelsa Link, nor Picea obovata Ledb. but should be named X Picea ruthenica, n.sp.

In the Barents Sea region, cyclicities of climatic processes with periods of around 90, 30-35, 22-23, 18 and 11-12 years have been established by spectral analysis of the data for the Kola Peninsula. Wavelet analysis of annual series of conifer tree-rings generalized for 10 regions along the northern timberline, from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka, for the period 1458-1975 has revealed the same periodicities for the vast areas of northern Russia. Climatic cyclicity with a period of about 35 years is known as the Bruckner cycle. Climatic cycles with periods of around 90, 22-23 and 11-12 years correlate well with the corresponding solar activity cycles.

He was also aware of the importance of history as an influence on present day plant distribution, especially in Arctic plants. This book brings to bear his wide range of interests in physics, chemistry, geology, climatology, meteorology and mathematics, as well as plant ecology and plant systematics, to analyse and explain the distribution of individual plant taxa across northwestern Europe.

157,"Change in phytomass and net primary productivity for Siberia from the mid-Holocene to the present | Phytomass (live plant mass) and net primary productivity are major components of the terrestrial carbon balance. A major location for phytomass storage is the subcontinent of Siberia, which is dominated by extensive reaches of taiga (boreal forest). The responsiveness of the phytomass component of the carbon pool is examined by comparing vegetation in the mid-Holocene (4600-6000 years before present) to modern potential vegetation. The mid-Holocene was warmer and moister in middle and northern Siberia than today, producing conditions ideal for boreal forest growth. As a result, both northern and middle taiga were dominated by shade-tolerant dark-needled species that thrive in moist climates. Today, shade-tolerant dark-needled taiga is restricted to western Siberia and the highlands of central Siberia, with its central and eastern components in the mid-Holocene replaced today by light-demanding light-needled species with lower productivity and phytomass. Total phytomass in Siberia in the mid-Holocene was 105.0+-3.1 Pg, compared to 85.9+-3.2 Pg in modern times, a loss of 19.1+-3.1 Pg of phytomass. The reduction in dark-needled northern and middle taiga classes results in a loss of 28.8 Pg, while the expansion of the corresponding light-needled taiga results in a gain of 13.5 Pg, a net loss of 15.3 Pg. The loss is actually greater, because the modern figures are for potential vegetation and not adjusted for agriculture and other anthropogenic disturbances. Given long periods for vegetation to approach equilibrium with climate, the phytomass component of the carbon pool is responsive to climate change. Changes in net primary productivity (NPP) for Siberia between the mid-Holocene and the present were not as large as changes in phytomass. A minor decrease in NPP (0.6 Pg yr-1, 10%) has occurred under our cooler modern climate, primarily due to the shift from dark-needled taiga in the mid-Holocene to light-needled taiga today. | ['denissenko', 'kolchugina', 'monserud', 'tchebakova'] | ","['denissenko', 'kolchugina', 'monserud', 'tchebakova']",2
158,"Piecing together the biogeographic history of Chenopodium vulvaria L. using botanical literature and collections | This study demonstrates the value of legacy literature and historic collections as a source of data on environmental history. Chenopodium vulvaria L. has declined in northern Europe and is of conservation concern in several countries, whereas in other countries outside Europe it has naturalised and is considered an alien weed. In its European range it is considered native in the south, but the northern boundary of its native range is unknown. It is hypothesised that much of its former distribution in northern Europe was the result of repeated introductions from southern Europe and that its decline in northern Europe is the result of habitat change and a reduction in the number of propagules imported to the north. A historical analysis of its ecology and distribution was conducted by mining legacy literature and historical botanical collections. Text analysis of habitat descriptions written on specimens and published in botanical literature covering a period of more than 200 years indicate that the habitat and introduction pathways of C. vulvaria have changed with time. Using the non-European naturalised range in a climate niche model, it is possible to project the range in Europe. By comparing this predicted model with a similar model created from all observations, it is clear that there is a large discrepancy between the realized and predicted distributions. This is discussed together with the social, technological and economic changes that have occurred in northern Europe, with respect to their influence on C. vulvaria. | ['groom'] | ",['groom'],0

162,"Plant communities of archaeological sites, abandoned dwellings, and trampled tundra in the eastern Canadian Arctic: A multivariate analysis | Arctic terrestrial ecosystems subjected to anthropogenic disturbance return to their original state only slowly, if at all. Investigations of abandoned settlements on three islands in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago have detected striking similarities among contemporary and ancient human settlements with regard to their effects on tundra vegetation and soils. Ordination procedures using 240 quadrats showed the plant assemblages of Thule (ca. 800 B.P.) winter dwellings on northern Devon and southern Cornwallis Islands to be floristically similar to pedestrian- trampled meadows on northeast Baffin Island last used ca. 1969. Comparisons from the literature made with other North American sites in the Low Arctic reveal similar findings.

Norway Spruce has come in from the north and Silver Fir from the mountains. Soils are brown forest, A(B)C, podzols, ABC, and fen AB(G)C. Plant lists covering 38 sites in pure and mixed woods are given from stands of Pine, Spruce, Oak (up to 286 years), Beech, Hornbeam, Lime, Silver Fir and Birch, with very complete site-factor detail, both silvicultural and ecological. The brown forest soils have been podzolized by bad practice, above all by the replacement of mixed forest on AC profiles by pure Pine and Spruce. Enough relict vegetation survives to show the richness of the forest before the advent of man, and the distribution of the main timbers at that time is detailed site by site. Mixtures suitable for replanting these sites are discussed. With the now accepted policy of bringing the forest over to more natural conditions the site unit is the frame within which this work should be organized. Finally the original vegetation is described and linked up with the classification of Tuxen, Hartmann and others. The forest belongs to the great climax region of Oak/mixed forest and shows two edaphic para-climaxes: (1) the Querceto-Betuletum without Beech on podzolized rust-coloured forest and heath soils with ABC horizons; (2) the Querceto-Carpinetum on fresh soils with AC or A(B)C horizons.

The presence of Najas flexilis, Typha latifolia, and modern beaver (Castor canadensis) suggest that central Alaska had a warmer climate during the early Holocene. | ['beaudoin', 'clague', 'doubt', 'froese', 'robinson'] | ","['beaudoin', 'clague', 'doubt', 'froese', 'robinson']",3
165,"The use of plant macrofossils and pollen in the palaeoecological reconstruction of vegetation | This thesis includes an overall summary of the study, plus 6 published papers and a manuscript. Macrofossil analyses in conjunction with pollen and sedimentological studies from a range of site types in the Irish Republic, Sweden, Denmark and the Faroe Islands revealed new details of Quaternary vegetational composition and dynamics in NW Europe. Abies, Picea and Pinus were recorded growing together with Rhododendron and a variety of ericaceous shrubs at the close of a previous inter-glacial in western Ireland. Fire was a factor in vegetation dynamics. Macrofossils from a small forest hollow demonstrated the late-Holocene survival of Pinus, and the co-existence of Quercus petraea with Q. robur and Tilia cordata with T. platyphyllos during the late Holocene in eastern Denmark. Macroremains of charcoal demonstrated the importance of fire. Pollen analyses with high spatial resolution from a humus profiles and small forest hollows gave details of stand-scale forest succession at sites in Ireland and Sweden. Macrofossil remains of herbaceous species combined with tephrochronology established the timing of permanent settlement on the Faroe Islands to AD 675-861. Settlement combined with the introduction of sheep led to the rapid transformation of a fragile ecosystem. Use of macrofossil analysis in climatic reconstruction and studies of past vegetation dynamics is discussed. | ['hannon'] | ",['hannon'],2

167,"Pollen-based biomes for Beringia 18,000, 6000 and 0 14C yr BP | The objective biomization method developed by Prentice et al. (1996) for Europe was extended using modern pollen samples from Beringia and then applied to fossil pollen data to reconstruct palaeovegetation patterns at 6000 and 18,000 14C yr BP. The predicted modern distribution of tundra, taiga and cool conifer forests in Alaska and north-western Canada generally corresponds well to actual vegetation patterns, although sites in regions characterized today by a mosaic of forest and tundra vegetation tend to be preferentially assigned to tundra. Siberian larch forests are delimited less well, probably due to the extreme under-representation of Larix in pollen spectra. The biome distribution across Beringia at 6000 14C yr BP was broadly similar to today, with little change in the northern forest limit, except for a possible northward advance in the Mackenzie delta region. The western forest limit in Alaska was probably east of its modern position. At 18,000 14C yr BP the whole of Beringia was covered by tundra. However, the importance of the various plant functional types varied from site to site, supporting the idea that the vegetation cover was a mosaic of different tundra types. | ['ager', 'anderson', 'andreev', 'bigelow', 'brubaker', 'cwynar', 'edward', 'eisner', 'harrison', 'hu', 'jolly', 'lozhkin', 'macdonald', 'mock', 'ritchie', 'sher', 'spear', 'williams', 'yu'] | ","['ager', 'anderson', 'andreev', 'bigelow', 'brubaker', 'cwynar', 'edward', 'eisner', 'harrison', 'hu', 'jolly', 'lozhkin', 'macdonald', 'mock', 'ritchie', 'sher', 'spear', 'williams', 'yu']",2
168,"A Holocene Pollen Record of Boreal Forest History from the Travaillant Lake Area Lower Mackenzie River Basin Canada | A 396-cm sediment sequence from a lake in the boreal woodland zone near Travaillant Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, provides a Holocene record of pollen percentages and species interactions. Three local pollen assemblage zones are described: a Betula-Populus-Juniperus zone from 10,500 to 9000 yr BP, a Picea-Betula zone from 9000 to 5100 yr BP, and a Picea-Betula-Alnus zone from 5100 yr BP to the present. The earliest vegetation recorded at this site is a mosaic of poplar groves, juniper and Shepherdia shrub, and fragmentary patches of tundra, replaced rapidly by spruce woodland at roughly 8500 yr BP, dominated initially by Picea glauca. P. mariana spread extensively between 8500 and 5000 yr BP, probably as a function of increasing paludification. The present spruce-dominated vegetation was in place by 5000 yr BP. Some changes in the pollen record can be explained by the Milankovitch early Holocene period of warmer summers followed by a cooling to modern conditions by 5000 yr BP. Others require explanations in terms of edaphic factors or biological interactons among the main taxa. | ['ritchie'] | ",['ritchie'],3

170,"Holocene Pollen Diagrams from Subarctic Labrador Ungava Vegetational History and Climatic Change | Six pollen diagrams have been prepared for lakes in northeastern Labrador-Ungava in order to investigate the chronology of deglaciation, the rate of plant colonization of the new landscape, and the climatic changes affecting the arctic tree line, as compared to northwest Canada. Thirty-eight 14C dates provide the chronological control, and show that the earliest organic records began at 10,300 BP. Initially, at all the older sites, there was a prolonged tundra episode, lasting up to 1000-2000 or more years. This was followed synchronously by low-arctic shrub communities of dwarf birch and alder, dominating the landscape for many centuries until open spruce woodland arrived, generally about 4000 BP. Prior to the spruce arrival, there were long ""tails"" of low Picea numbers. Spruce numbers declined after about 3000 BP, and tundra has spread into former woodland since that time. The northward spruce migration was delayed relative to western arctic Canada, possibly due to marine influence on climate, but the subsequent southward expansion of tundra was broadly synchronous in both regions. The last 3000 yr of colder climate have also seen a very marked decline in lake productivity, as measured radiometrically by the rate of sediment accumulation. Thus, the topmost decimeters of these lake sediments date back several millennia, and should be used with great caution in comparing modern vegetation with recent pollen sedimentation. | ['nichols', 'short'] | ","['nichols', 'short']",1

172,"Pollen records, postglacial | Northwestern north america | Pollen records from northwestern North America provide information on vegetation and climate changes during the last 16,000 years. Interpretations are supplemented in several regions by plant macrofossil and charcoal data that describe individual species occurrences and local fire history.

175,"Pollen-stratigraphical evidence of Holocene hydrological change in northern Fennoscandia supported by independent isotopic data | Pollen records from 21 sites were used to reconstruct Holocene hydrological changes in northern Fennoscandia. The inferred dominance of maritime-type Betula-forests from c. 9600 BP onwards indicate an oceanic climate in the region during the early Holocene, with high amounts of precipitation and low seasonal contrasts. This interpretation is supported by oxygen isotope records obtained on lacustrine carbonates from Abisko, northern Sweden. Enrichment of 18O during the early Holocene suggests enhanced zonal circulation and a pronounced influence of Atlantic air-masses in northern Sweden. The pattern of Pinus expansion in the area was time-transgressive, ranging from 9200-8000 BP in the extreme north-east to 7900-5500 BP in the western and southwestern parts of the region. The replacement of Betula-forests by Pinus-forests indicates a climatic change towards drier summers and increased seasonality. At Abisko, a close correlation between regional Pinus expansion and depletion of 18O in lacustrine carbonates suggests that the expansion of Pinus was triggered by a gradual attenuation of the influence of westerlies. Thus, in large-scale palaeohydrological terms, the early expansion of Pinus in the north-easternmost parts of Fennoscandia as compared to the successively later expansion in the west and southwest may reflect a gradually decreasing influence of Atlantic air-masses in northern Fennoscandia during the early and mid Holocene. | ['hammarlund', 'seppa'] | ","['hammarlund', 'seppa']",0

Absolute dates of the Holocene, paleobotanic information and migration rates point out that to the beginning of the early Holocene the Q robur area border lay in latitude 53-54.degree. N. Regularities of the soil formation, biogeomorphological importance of river valleys, paleobotanic and phylogenetic data indicate that flood-plain oak forests were the earliest formation of the oak forests in the North.

178,"Postglacial evolution and spatial differentiation of seasonal temperate rainforest in western Canada | Surface samples from Vancouver Island, Canada, were used to assess the relationship between discrete seasonal temperate rainforest (STR) plant communities and their corresponding pollen signatures. Pollen from ten sediment cores was further used to evaluate the postglacial development of these communities. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the surface data revealed the distinctiveness of the modern pollen rain, with samples from the Coastal Douglas Fir (CDF) zone, the dry Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) zone, the wet CWH subzones and the Mountain Hemlock (MH) zone clustering distinctly. PCA of the fossil data revealed early-seral open canopy, wet rainforest, subalpine rainforest and Lateglacial plant associations and showed that the STR has changed markedly through time. Pinus woodlands with low palynological richness prevailed in the early Lateglacial period, only to be supplanted by mixed conifer forest with increased pollen richness. In the early Holocene, STR vegetation differentiated spatially as early-seral open canopy forests expanded, though a non-analogue Picea-dominated forest persisted on the moist outer coast. Generally high pollen richness is attributed to the expansion of dryland habitat coupled with the development of a fire-maintained vegetation mosaic. In the mid- and late-Holocene intervals, open canopy communities persisted in eastern areas, eventually developing into modern CDF and dry CWH forest. In contrast, moist and oceanic CWH rainforest developed on central and western Vancouver Island, whereas subalpine forest established at high elevation. Pollen richness declined in the mid Holocene concomitant with increased precipitation and a general reduction in the incidence of fire, though this trend was offset somewhat in the late Holocene by paludification. | ['brown', 'fitton', 'hebda', 'nielsen'] | ","['brown', 'fitton', 'hebda', 'nielsen']",2
179,"The postglacial history of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in western Europe: Evidence from mitochondrial DNA variation | The geographical structure of mitochondrial (mt)DNA variants (mitotypes) was investigated in 38 western European populations of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of total DNA and a homologous cox1 probe. Three major mitotypes (designated a, b and d) were detected. Within Spain all three major mitotypes were found, gene diversity was high, HT = 0.586, and this diversity was distributed predominantly among rather than within populations (FST(M) = 0.813 for the seven Spanish populations). Mitotype d was present only in the most southerly population from the Sierra Nevada. Elsewhere in Europe, populations showed little or no mtDNA diversity within regions, but there were marked differences between regions. Italian populations were fixed for mitotype b; populations from northern France, Germany, Poland, Russia and southern Sweden were fixed for mitotype a; while populations in northern Fennoscandia were fixed for mitotype b. The isolated Scottish populations were predominantly of mitotype a, but mitotype b was present in three of the 20 populations scored. In Scotland, UK gene diversity (HT = 0.120) and genetic differentiation among populations (FST(M) = 0.37) was much lower than in Spain. When interpreted in the light of complementary data from pollen analysis and nuclear genetic markers, the results suggest that present-day populations of P. sylvestris in western Europe have been derived from at least three different sources after glaciation. | ['ennos', 'morman', 'sinclair'] | ","['ennos', 'morman', 'sinclair']",4
180,"Postglacial history of the vegetation and climate of pessieres and fir trees in eastern Quebec and southern Labrador | The aim of this research is to produce a complete picture of the postglacial history of the vegetation and climate in spruce and fir forests in eastern Quebec and southern Labrador. The study is based on pollen assemblages from 35 lakes in the spruce-lichen bioclimatic domain and the eastern spruce-moss, balsam fir-white birch and balsam fir-yellow birch subdomains. We analyzed the pollen assemblages from lake sediments, reconstructed the postglacial climate and vegetation of the sites, then summarized the results at different spatial and temporal scales. These reconstructions are based on the modern analogue technique and on a database of 2 418 sites in eastern North America and in Greenland for which the pollen assemblage, vegetation and climate are known. The history of the study area's vegetation can be divided into 3 phases: a non-arboreal tundra phase (predating 11 000 years before present, or BP), an afforestation phase (11 000 - 9 000 years BP) and a forest phase (from 9 000 years BP until today). At the beginning of the postglacial period, the Goldtwaith Sea submerged the coasts of the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Quebec, and patches of the Appalachian Glacier Complex persisted in central Gaspesie. The vegetation cover near the river was sparse: grasses, then herbaceous willows (Salix sp.) and birch (Betula sp.) shrubs set in, forming tundras. During the afforestation phase, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) were present everywhere in the landscapes of the Gaspesie, Bas-Saint- Laurent/Temiscouata and Charlevoix/Laurentides regions. Black spruce was rare in the Cote-Nord region, but white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.) was already present in southern Labrador. At the beginning of the forest phase, balsam fir dominated stands of eastern Quebec and southern Labrador. The age of forest onset is asynchronous across the territory due to the location of the sites in relation to the front of the receding ice cap, and to the surface water conditions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and of the epicontinental margin of the Labrador Sea. During the afforestation phase and at the beginning of the forest phase, vegetation composition at the sites bordering the lower estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence differed from that at sites located upstream and inland. American green alder (Alnus crispa (Aiton) Pursh, synonym of Alnus alnobetula subsp. crispa (Aiton) Raus) was abundant in the Gulf region, and the vegetation present in haute Gaspesie was closer to that of Cote-Nord than to that of the Chaleur Bay and Bas-Saint-Laurent/Temiscouata regions. Then, between 7 000 and 5 000 years BP, a distribution of vegetation similar to the one known today took hold, with less contrast in the abundance of plants between the Haute- Gaspesie and Chaleur Bay regions. Since around 4 000 years BP, white pine (Pinus strobus L.) populations have declined in the forest landscape to the benefit of boreal species such as black spruce. Our climate reconstructions show a gradual 4 degrees C warming of July temperatures until 7 000 years BP, followed by a 1 degrees C cooling. Annual precipitation increased by 500 mm from 11 000 to 5 000 years BP, then remained relatively stable until today. A climate transition is noted around 7 500 years BP. In eastern Quebec, the climate at the start of the forest phase was warmer and drier than today; atmospheric circulation from west to east was more intense, with greater summer cloudiness. This could be explained by a greater moisture exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, resulting in an increased frequency of thick fog. The end of glacial meltwater inputs in the St-Lawrence River and the Gulf of Lawrence, the establishment of current surface water conditions in the Labrador Sea and the circulation of polar air could explain the climate transition observed around 7 500 years BP. | ['frechette', 'grondin', 'larouche', 'lavoie', 'richard'] | ","['frechette', 'grondin', 'larouche', 'lavoie', 'richard']",2

184,"Postglacial spatiotemporal peatland initiation and lateral expansion dynamics in North America and northern Europe | Peatlands are major ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere and have a significant role in global biogeochemical processes. Consequently, there is growing interest in understanding past, present and future peatland dynamics. However, chronological and geographical data on peatland initiation are scattered, impeding the reliable establishment of postglacial spatiotemporal peatland formation patterns and their possible connection to climate. In order to present a comprehensive account of postglacial peatland formation histories in North America and northern Europe, we collected a data set of 1400 basal peat ages accompanied by below-peat sediment-type interpretations from literature. Our data indicate that all peatland initiation processes (i.e. primary mire formation, terrestrialization and paludification) co-occurred throughout North America and northern Europe during the Holocene, and almost equal amounts of peatlands formed via these three processes. Furthermore, the data suggest that the processes exhibited some spatiotemporal patterns. On both continents, primary mire formation seems to occur first, soon followed by terrestrialization and later paludification. Primary mire formation appears mostly restricted to coastal areas, whereas terrestrialization and paludification were more evenly distributed across the continents. Primary mire formation seems mainly connected with physical processes, such as ice sheet retreat. Terrestrialization probably reflected progressive infilling of water bodies on longer timescales but was presumably drought driven on shorter timescales. Paludification seems affected by climate as it slowed down in Europe during the driest phase of the Holocene between 6 and 5 ka. Lateral expansion of existing peatlands accelerated c. 5000 years ago on both continents, which was likely connected to an increase in relative moisture. | ['korhola', 'ruppel', 'valiranta', 'virtanen'] | ","['korhola', 'ruppel', 'valiranta', 'virtanen']",4

186,"Postglacial Vegetation History of the Mackenzie River Basin Canada | Three radiocarbon-dated cores from small lakes provide pollen records of postglacial vegetation change in the central Mackenzie River basin. These data are combined with previously published records to reconstruct vegetation development from central Alberta to the Mackenzie delta. The paleoecological data demonstrate that a continuous corridor of herb-and-shrub-dominated vegetation extended between Beringia and the Great Plains of North America from deglaciation until about 10,000 yr B.P. The initial vegetation was replaced by spruce forests between 10,000 and 8500 yr B.P. Significant vegetation change continued until approximately 5000 yr B.P. when the muskeg-dominated landscape typical of the present subarctic was established. The initial herb-and-shrub vegetation was likely a reprise of conditions which existed during earlier Pleistocene deglaciations. These conditions may have provided a favorable environment for animals adapted to nonforested vegetation and promoted migration southward from Beringia and northward from the Great Plains during the last deglaciation and earlier Pleistocene deglaciations. The sequence of postglacial vegetation change in the Mackenzie basin likely reflects a combination of climatic change, edaphic change, and plant migration patterns and interactions. | ['macdonald'] | ",['macdonald'],1
187,"Pre-glacial and interglacial pollen records over the last 3 Ma from northwest Canada: Why do Holocene forests differ from those of previous interglaciations? | We synthesize pollen spectra from eleven dated stratigraphic sections from central and northern Yukon. Palaeomagnetic and tephra dating indicates the earliest assemblages, representing closed canopy Pinus and Picea forest, are middle-late Pliocene age. More open forest conditions, indicated by increased Poaceae and with evidence of permafrost, are dated at ca 3 Ma. While Pinus pollen is abundant at 3 Ma, it is reduced in records after 2.6 Ma, and subsequent Pleistocene interglacial forest records are repeatedly dominated by Picea, along with Alnus and small but significant amounts of Abies. Surface sample comparisons indicate that Abies was more widespread and abundant in past interglaciations than at present and that Middle-Pleistocene Picea Abies forest grew in the northern Yukon Porcupine Basin, 500 km beyond modern Abies limits. In contrast, Pinus, which occurs today in southern and central Yukon, was not a significant component of these Pleistocene interglacial forests. Late-Holocene pollen assemblages with rare Abies and high Pinus are the most distinct in the past 2.6 Ma. Possible factors driving Holocene difference are paleoclimate, paludification, changes in megafaunal herbivory and an unusual fire regime. Anthropogenic burning is a factor unique to the Holocene, and if it is shown to be important in this case, it would challenge our notion of what constitutes boreal wilderness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

188,"On the pre-settlement history of Icelandic vegetation | In recent years more emphasis has been on studying palaeovegetation through lake sediments rather than peat sections. as the pollen assemblages preserved in lake sediments are assumed to reflect more regional vegetation than those stored in the peat. In addition the pollen record of the sediments extends further back in time, most often to the very beginning of the history of the vegetation. The longest record discussed in this paper is from northern Iceland and indicates a harsh environment, solifluction and a discontinuous plant cover in the wake of deglaciation. In the Late Preboreal and Early Boreal Chronozones dwarf shrub heath and shrub heath developed. followed by juniper and birch copses. During the Late Boreal and Early Atlantic Chronozones birch woodland had established itself in the more favourable places, when a climatic oscillation occurred and the birch woodland had a setback, but recovered rather soon again and more than 7000 years ago birch covered the lowland areas both in northern and southern Iceland. During the Late Atlantic and Subboreal Chronozones the birch woodland showed a retrogressive succession towards a more open landscape with expanding peatlands and heaths. Pollen percentages indicate that the woodland regenerated several times during the Subatlantic Chronozone, however the PAR values reflect no such regeneration of the woodland. Perhaps some new and more favourabte habitats were created for the birch after a period of cool climate and instability during the latter half of the Holocene. | ['hallsdottir'] | ",['hallsdottir'],1

190,"Present-day and mid-Holocene biomes reconstructed from pollen and plant macrofossil data from the former Soviet Union and Mongolia | Fossil pollen data supplemented by tree macrofossil records were used to reconstruct the vegetation of the Former Soviet Union and Mongolia at 6000 years. Pollen spectra were assigned to biomes using the plant-functional-type method developed by Prentice et al. (1996). Surface pollen data and a modern vegetation map provided a test of the method. This is the first time such a broad-scale vegetation reconstruction for the greater part of northern Eurasia has been attempted with objective techniques. The new results confirm previous regional palaeoenvironmental studies of the mid-Holocene while providing a comprehensive synopsis and firmer conclusions. West of the Ural Mountains temperate deciduous forest extended both northward and southward from its modern range. The northern limits of cool mixed and cool conifer forests were also further north than present. Taiga was reduced in European Russia, but was extended into Yakutia where now there is cold deciduous forest. The northern limit of taiga was extended (as shown by increased Picea pollen percentages, and by tree macrofossil records north of the present-day forest limit) but tundra was still present in north-eastern Siberia. The boundary between forest and steppe in the continental interior did not shift substantially, and dry conditions similar to present existed in western Mongolia and north of the Aral Sea. | ['afanaseva', 'andreev', 'berezina', 'bezusko', 'blyakharchuk', 'bolikhovskaya', 'cheddadi', 'chernavskaya', 'chernova', 'dirksen', 'dorofeyuk', 'elina', 'filimonova', 'glebov', 'guiot', 'gunova', 'harrison', 'jolly', 'khomutova', 'kvavadze', 'osipova', 'panova', 'prentice', 'saarse', 'sevastyanov', 'tarasov', 'volkova', 'webb', 'iii', 'zernitskaya'] | ","['afanaseva', 'andreev', 'berezina', 'bezusko', 'blyakharchuk', 'bolikhovskaya', 'cheddadi', 'chernavskaya', 'chernova', 'dirksen', 'dorofeyuk', 'elina', 'filimonova', 'glebov', 'guiot', 'gunova', 'harrison', 'jolly', 'khomutova', 'kvavadze', 'osipova', 'panova', 'prentice', 'saarse', 'sevastyanov', 'tarasov', 'volkova', 'webb', 'iii', 'zernitskaya']",4

192,"Preservation of the cultural legacy of the indigenous Sami in northern forest reserves-Present shortcomings and future possibilities | In Swedish Lappland, large national parks and nature reserves include forests with exceptional biodiversity values. While they are located in the ancient cultural landscapes of the indigenous Sami, this aspect has rarely been considered in the process of nature protection. In this study, we discuss how the preservation of Sami cultural values can be introduced and developed in forest reserves. We do this by reviewing recent research on the cultural legacy that the Sami have left in the boreal forest and discuss why so much of this legacy is found in the large areas of ecologically valuable forest that still exist in Lappland. We find that the Sami left deep imprints in the trees, in the forest structure, and in the archaeological record. We also find that the large forest reserves were created in the areas where the timber frontier arrived last, so they were less affected by both early actions of recurrent logging and by modern forestry. These forest reserves contain the ancient trees, the dead wood, and the disturbance regimes that favor biodiversity, and also a substantial Sami cultural legacy that has largely disappeared in the managed forest landscape. The preservation of this legacy is not without its challenges. We address the lack of inventory data, the poor collaboration between different authorities, and the general lack of involvement of the Sami communities; furthermore, we propose measures to overcome these shortcomings. If such measures are introduced, the value of the large and unique forest reserves of Swedish Lappland would be greatly enriched. The cultural legacies in forest dominated landscapes in northern Scandinavia is comparable to many other very northern or very southern regions in that they share a similar history of millennia of indigenous land use, with abrupt changes in modern time and also have large protected areas today. | ['norstedt', 'ostlund'] | ","['norstedt', 'ostlund']",2
193,"The problem of the Beringian phratry of formations of boreal-type vegetation | The origin of modern plant associations assigned by V.B.Sochava to the Beringian phratry of formations is discussed in the context of the history of Beringia. The principal stages of the development of vegetation are traced with respect to the physico-geographic changes, from the Early Cenophytic down to Recent times. During the Pleistocene a radical change in plant distribution occurred. It resulted in the maximum southward retreat of forests in northeastern Asia and the establishment of the present relations between zonal and higher-elevation complexes. The impoverished Beringian forests that had retreated to the south served as a basis for the rise of the Beringian phratry of recent taiga formations comprising, for example, those dominated by Picea ajanensis, Pinus pumila; Larix kurilensis; and other arboreal species. -from Author | ['buks'] | ",['buks'],2
194,"The problem of conifer species migration lag in the Pacific Northwest region since the last glaciation | Multiproxy evidence indicates that warmer-than-present summers became established in Eastern Beringia as early as 14,000-13,000 years ago, but the dispersal of spruces, pines, cedars and hemlocks across the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of southern Alaska did not begin until at least 1500 years afterwards, and took many thousands of years to be completed. There are many potential reasons for this slow spread of PNW conifers towards their modern range limits. The absence of mycorrhizae in the soils of southern Alaska may have slowed conifer establishment. The availability of soil moisture was another limiting factor. With the exception of Pinus contorta, the other PNW conifers become established most readily from seeds that fall on moist, shaded substrates, thus they are not good pioneering species. Competition with alder and birch played an important role, especially along Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula. Alder or alder and birch dominated these regions until the mid- to late Holocene. The other key element for most PNW conifer species is the precipitation regime. The hemlocks, cedars and Sitka spruce are not drought-hardy. So although the PNW temperature regime may have been warm enough in early postglacial times to support the growth of PNVV conifers, it was probably too dry for them to successfully become established in new regions. The conflation of these environmental factors limits our present understanding of the problem, but the recent trend of multi-proxy analysis in Quaternary paleoecology will certainly sharpen our reconstructions. Such proxies as conifer needle stomata and insect fossil remains hold significant promise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. | ['elia'] | ",['elia'],2
195,"Some problems in studying the interrelations of forest and tundra ecosystems | Reviews and evaluates the body of results obtained at two research stations in the Far North of the USSR (and published in the literature) in ecological studies of forest-tundra vegetation, interpreting them from the point of view of forest/tundra interrelations with particular reference to the Taimyr peninsula. Aspects covered include the dating of the 'forest phase' in the post-glacial history of the peninsula [cf. following abstract], dendrochronology, climatic changes, soils, biological productivity, etc. [cf., e.g., FA 33, 2312; 34, 3206; 35, 3504]. It is suggested that in the past studies were too preoccupied with the causes of the treelessness of the tundra and shifts in the northern limit of forest vegetation, and that the approach exemplified by these present studies, which is based on phytocoenology and, in particular, the functional structure of plant groupings [cf.

The peat profile to be analyzed is dated by AMS 14C-analyses of solely Sphagnum remains and wiggle-matching the results with the atmospheric 14C curve. Sampling for pollen analysis is at a near-annual resolution on the basis of the age-depth chronology. The study also incorporates the latest developments in modelling pollen loading and reconstructing the vegetation coverage around the site being studied. Preliminary simulation results suggest that the relevant source area of pollen in the Nellim pine forests is about 1 km. This indicates that a reconstruction of the vegetation is possible within a 1 km radius around the study site. Further research is still required since the simulations are made using pollen productivity estimates from Denmark and southern Sweden which will, in all likelihood, be different from those in northern Finland. | ['hagberg'] | ",['hagberg'],2

Tree line in the Pleistocene apparently fluctuated across southwestern Washington and during the Holocene advanced to higher latitudes in Alaska and to higher altitudes in the cordillera. Advance of forest northwestward along the coast was from unglaciated refugia located in Washington and possibly in the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia and other places along the Pacific slope.

201,"Rapid responses of the prairie-forest ecotone to early Holocene aridity in mid-continental North America | The prairie-forest transition in midcontinental North America is a major physiognomic boundary, and its shifts during the Holocene are a classic example of climate-driven ecotonal dynamics. Recent work suggests asymmetrical Holocene behavior, with a relatively rapid early Holocene deforestation and more gradual reforestation later in the Holocene. This paper presents a new synthesis of the Holocene history of the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone in the north-central US and central Canada that updates prior mapping efforts and systematically assesses rates of change. Changes in percent woody cover (%WC) are inferred from fossil pollen records, using the modern analog technique and surface-sediment pollen samples cross-referenced against remotely sensed observations. For contemporary pollen samples from the Great Plains, %WC linearly correlates to percent arboreal pollen (%AP), but regression parameters vary interregionally. At present, %AP is consistently higher than %WC, because of high background levels of arboreal pollen. Holocene maps of the eastern prairie-forest ecotone agree with prior maps, showing a rapid decrease in %WC and eastward prairie advance between 10,000 and 8000 ka (1 ka = 1000 calibrated years before present), a maximum eastward position of the ecotone from 7 to 6 ka, and increased %WC and westward prairie retreat after 6 ka. Ecotone position is ambiguous in Iowa and southeastern Minnesota, due to a scarcity of modern analogs for early-Holocene samples with high Minus abundances and for samples from alluvial sediments. The northern prairie-forest ecotone was positioned in central Saskatchewan between 12 and 10 ka, stabilized from 10 to 6 ka despite decreases in %WC at some sites, then moved south after 6 ka. In both east and north. ecotonal movements are consistent with a dry early Holocene and increasing moisture availability after 6 ka. Sites near the ecotone consistently show an asymmetric pattern of abrupt early Holocene deforestation (<300 years) and gradual reforestation after 6 ka. Early Holocene decreases in %WC are faster than the corresponding drops in %AP, because the analog-based %WC reconstructions correct for the high background levels of arboreal pollen types that blur temporal variations in %AP. For example, at Elk Like. the %AP decline lasts 1000 years, whereas the %WC decline occurs between adjacent pollen samples, approximately 300 years apart. Thus, early Holocene deforestation may have been even more abrupt than previously recognized. Rapid deforestation likely was promoted both by rapid climate changes around 8.2 ka and positive fire-vegetation feedbacks. Non-linear vegetational responses to hydrological variability are consistent with 1) other paleorecords showing rapid die-offs of some eastern tree species in response to aridity and 2) observations of threshold-type ecological responses to recent climate events. The 21st-century trajectory for the Great Plains prairie-forest ecotone is uncertain, because climate models differ over the direction of regional precipitation trends. but future drying would be more likely to trigger threshold-type shifts in ecotone position.

Shore emergence stimulates the downward expansion of shrub communities on shore (mostly willows) that form dense mats acting as snow traps protecting conifer seedlings on shores. Conifer population structures and tree rings indicate three phases in the forest margin expansion process: (1) an initial period of slow growth and juvenile sparse stands controlled by shrub mat distribution and densities, (2) a phase characterized by denser conifer mats, and growth release of above shrub tree stems, and (3) a final phase of maturation dominated by a vegetative regeneration process (clones) and regressive growth forms, highly controlled by the shore climatic conditions. | ['begin', 'gregoire'] | ","['begin', 'gregoire']",0
204,"Reconstructing Millennial-Scale, Regional Paleoclimates of Boreal Canada during the Holocene | Regional paleoclimate reconstructions for northern Canada quantify Holocene climate variability on orbital and millennial time scales and provide a context to better understand the current global warming. The reconstructions are based on available pollen diagrams from the boreal and low Arctic zones of Canada and use the modern analog technique (MAT). Four regional reconstructions document the space-time evolution of the climate during the Holocene. Highest summer and winter temperatures anomalies are found in central Canada during the early Holocene. Eastern Canada was relatively cool in the early Holocene, whereas central Canada was warmest at that time. Labrador was relatively dry in the early to mid-Holocene during which time western Canada was relatively moist. Millennial-scale temperature variations, especially the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are seen across the continent, with some suggestion of time-transgressive changes from west to east. At the millennial scale, precipitation anomalies are of opposite signs in eastern and western Canada. The results herein indicate that modern increases in temperatures in northern Canada far exceed natural millennial-scale climate variability. | ['gajewski', 'viau'] | ","['gajewski', 'viau']",1
205,"Regional variation in susceptibility of eastern North American forests to budworm attack based on history of outbreaks | The history of Spruce budworm outbreaks based on radial-growth studies of host and non-host trees from five main regions and eight subregions in eastern North America, and covering a period of two centuries for most regions, throws some light on the epidemiology of this insect. Past outbreaks, instead of embracing the whole area subject to the most recent series of outbreaks, occurred in separate parts of the area. Epidemics of this insect did not recur regularly within regions, and the time of occurrence of future outbreaks therefore cannot be predicted with accuracy from the periodicity of past ones. Pulpwood stands in the Atlantic sector were more prone to attack than those in Ontario. Optimum forest conditions (abundance of Balsam Fir) for budworm outbreaks are found in the Atlantic sector, while optimum weather conditions (dry summers) occur in Ontario, but forest conditions in Ontario are a more limiting factor than climate in the Atlantic sector. Outbreaks have occurred most frequently and have been most severe in the southern Quebec/Maine/New Brunswick region. Although Fir reaches greatest abundance in central Quebec and in the Gaspe Peninsula, these regions afford marginal weather conditions for the development of outbreaks, owing to the prevailing cool wet climate. Past outbreaks were almost completely the result of natural factors. These continue to be important, but cutting practices, forest fires caused by man, and chemical treatment of budworm-infested areas are altering natural forest succession; this will probably affect the course of future outbreaks.

Modern data were compared with fossil pollen diagrams. In the modern spectra of non-forest zones average Picea pollen percentage is about 1 %, the highest values (up to 3 %) are usually connected with open locations and reflect the regional component of pollen rain. Within the coniferous forest belt average pollen abundance is about 10 %, but this value varies considerably from 1 to 40 % depending on local characteristics of sampling points. The lowest Picea pollen percentages (1 % and less) are observed in the pollen spectra of oligo- and mesotrophic mires, thus the level of 1 % can be significant for Picea and can indicate the continuous range of Picea. For an appropriate interpretation of low Picea pollen abundance in fossil samples the abundance should be analyzed together with other components of the pollen spectra. Large areas of Picea forests are not always reflected in pollen spectra as a high Picea percentage/PAR, as in unfavorable climatic or hydrological conditions the pollen production of Picea forests can be very low. Comparison of fossil and modern pollen spectra shows that a modern analogue of Holocene Picea forests in Central European Russia has not yet been discovered. | ['kosenko', 'nosova', 'severova', 'volkova'] | ","['kosenko', 'nosova', 'severova', 'volkova']",0

Four large datasets are presented, including over 400 fossil-pollen sites, 80 plant-macrofossil sites, and 450 and 600 modern beech populations for chloroplast and nuclear markers, respectively. The largely complementary palaeobotanical and genetic data indicate that: (i) beech survived the last glacial period in multiple refuge areas; (ii) the central European refugia were separated from the Mediterranean refugia; (iii) the Mediterranean refuges did not contribute to the colonization of central and northern Europe; (iv) some populations expanded considerably during the postglacial period, while others experienced only a limited expansion; (v) the mountain chains were not geographical barriers for beech but rather facilitated its diffusion; and (vi) the modern genetic diversity was shaped over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. This scenario differs from many recent treatments of tree phylogeography in Europe that largely focus on the last ice age and the postglacial period to interpret genetic structure and argue that the southern peninsulas (Iberian, Italian and Balkan) were the main source areas for trees in central and northern Europe. | ['beaulieu', 'comp', 'dupanloup', 'geburek', 'gomory', 'knaap', 'latalowa', 'litt', 'magri', 'paule', 'petit', 'roure', 'tantau', 'vendramin'] | ","['beaulieu', 'comp', 'dupanloup', 'geburek', 'gomory', 'knaap', 'latalowa', 'litt', 'magri', 'paule', 'petit', 'roure', 'tantau', 'vendramin']",0

In addition, short pocosins found along the southeastern coast also can be considered as Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, even though they differ significantly from traditional concepts of boreal peatlands. Along the southern limit of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, where climate is limiting, edaphic factors allow for the development of outliers. As the current distribution of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands is related to Sphagnum spore rain, past distributions of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands can be constructed from spore records preserved in lakes and peatlands. Here we present six time slices extending back to the Last Glacial Maximum to determine how Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have varied in both time and space. The spore record indicates that Sphagnum-dominated peatlands were present in North America during the Last Glacial Maximum although they were spatially limited to central Alaska, the Olympic Peninsula and Puget Trough of Washington, and to a narrow band in the eastern states of Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Maryland. During the Late Wisconsinan Sphagnum-dominated peatlands shifted northwards in eastern North America and expanded farther into Alaska and the Midwest. The Late Wisconsinan/Holocene transition marks a time of overall increase in the area supporting Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, while extending farther in eastern Canada and western continental and coastal regions, they almost completely disappear in the Midwest where they were extensive earlier. Sphagnum-dominated peatlands generally reach their current extent about 2,000-3,000 years ago. Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have dramatically changed their distribution and abundance since the Last Glacial Maximum, and hence the carbon that is stored in these present-day important sinks has also changed dramatically. When compared to the estimated 220 Pg of carbon stored in North American peatlands today, less than 10% of this carbon was present in these peatland during the LGM. | ['gignac', 'halsey', 'vitt'] | ","['gignac', 'halsey', 'vitt']",1

With the retreat of the ice-sheets, changing climates permitted many plants to expand their ranges onto freshly deglaciated ground. The spread of these plants can be followed across continents by means of the pollen preserved in suitable sediments. Two aspects of this spread will be discussed. First, at individual sites, it is possible to compare the way in which the populations increase with theoretical models of population growth. It appears that, for forest trees, the populations increased exponentially, doubling every 20-500 years. Second, by estimating, from the pollen curve, when populations of each taxon began to increase at a series of sites across a continent, it is possible to estimate annual 'rates of spread'. These may be up to 2000 m a-1, but it appears that spread may be achieved at population densities too low to be detected in the pollen record. The 'spread' observed may be due solely to the initial abundance/distance gradient and the rate of population increase. | ['bennett'] | ",['bennett'],0

220,"The Stability of the Northern Canadian Tree Limit | This paper presents data on and discusses the degree of postglacial stability of the northern Canadian tree limit. Holocene climatic changes have been both directional and synchronous for this region, though deteriorations/ameliorations either (1) lagged from west to east, (2) were buffered by local geographic factors, or (3) were not registered in the fossil record owing to the inherent persistence of the vegetation at some sites. The present northern tree limit in eastern Canada is in equilibrium with the prevailing climate, with the tree populations successfully regenerating both sexually and vegetatively. These tree stands are still occupying their maximum Hypsithermal positions. In contrast, the tree limit, tree line, and intervening forest-tundra ecotone in central and western Canada are out of equilibrium with today's climate. These populations are not sexually regenerative and apparently became established during warmer climates where the tree line was north of its present position. As such, they are susceptible to destruction by further climatic deterioration or anthropogenic disruption. ¬© 1983 Taylor & Francis Group All right reserved. | ['elliott', 'fisk'] | ","['elliott', 'fisk']",4
221,"The structure and physiographical factors of formation of heterogeneous vegetational cover in the Lappland Mountain Tundra Reserve (Kola Peninsula) | Heterogeneous vegetational cover of mountain tundras of the Lappland reserve has been formed under the influence of some paleogeographical factors, such as the difference in age of settling of territory by different geographical groups after thawing ice cover, the fluctuation of upper border of forest (timer line) in the Holocene and the evidence of new intensive tectonic movements. The formation of some specific features of the modern vegetational cover resulted from the effect of these factors and also the modern topo-edaphic difference of mountainous massives. These features are fragmentary patterns of vegetation in the upper sub-belt mountains, the penetration of some hyparctic species and their communities in the high-altitude slopes, the formation of combinations of communities with different geographical elements and the existence of sharp border between separate communities and their combinations in all sub-belts of the mountain-tundras belts. | ['kholod'] | ",['kholod'],4
222,"Synchronicity in climate and vegetation transitions between Europe and North America during the Holocene | Interpreting the postglacial climate history of the European continent using pollen data has proven difficult due in part to human modification of the landscape. Separating climate from human-caused changes in the vegetation requires a strategy for determining times of change across the entire region. We quantified transitions in the vegetation across Europe during the past 12,000 years using a mixture model approach on two datasets: radiocarbon dates from pollen diagrams and zone boundaries from selected reference sites. Major transitions in the vegetation, as recorded in pollen diagrams, appear synchronous across the continent. These transitions were also synchronous with those identified in North America pollen diagrams and major environmental changes recorded in North Atlantic marine records and Greenland ice cores. This synchronicity suggests that the major vegetation transitions in Europe during the Holocene and late glacial were primarily caused by large-scale atmospheric circulation change. These climate changes may have caused some of the cultural, political and migration changes in European societies during the Holocene. | ['atkinson', 'fine', 'gajewski', 'sawada', 'viau'] | ","['atkinson', 'fine', 'gajewski', 'sawada', 'viau']",0
223,"Timber logging in central Siberia is the main source for recent Arctic driftwood | Recent findings indicated spruce from North America and larch from eastern Siberia to be the dominating tree species of Arctic driftwood throughout the Holocene. However, changes in source region forest and river characteristics, as well as ocean current dynamics and sea ice extent likely influence its spatiotemporal composition. Here, we present 2556 driftwood samples from Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, and the Faroe Islands. A total of 498 out of 969 Pinus sylvestris ring width series were cross-dated at the catchment level against a network of Eurasian boreal reference chronologies. The central Siberian Yenisei and Angara Rivers account for 91% of all dated pines, with their outermost rings dating between 1804 and 1999. Intensified logging and timber rafting along the Yenisei and Angara in the mid-20th century, together with high discharge rates, explain the vast quantity of material from this region and its temporal peak ca. 1960. Based on the combined application of wood-anatomical and dendrochronological techniques on a well-replicated data set, our results question the assumption that Arctic driftwood mainly consists of millennial-old larch and spruce. Nevertheless, data from other species and regions, together with longer boreal reference chronologies, are needed for generating reliable proxy archives at the interface of marine and terrestrial environments. | ['agafonov', 'buentgen', 'churakova', 'eggertsson', 'esper', 'hellmann', 'kirdyanov', 'knorre', 'myglan', 'nievergelt', 'nikolaev', 'schweingruber', 'tegel', 'verstege'] | ","['agafonov', 'buentgen', 'churakova', 'eggertsson', 'esper', 'hellmann', 'kirdyanov', 'knorre', 'myglan', 'nievergelt', 'nikolaev', 'schweingruber', 'tegel', 'verstege']",0
224,"Tree Migration-Rates: Narrowing the Gap between Inferred Post-Glacial Rates and Projected Rates | Faster-than-expected post-glacial migration rates of trees have puzzled ecologists for a long time. In Europe, post-glacial migration is assumed to have started from the three southern European peninsulas (southern refugia), where large areas remained free of permafrost and ice at the peak of the last glaciation. However, increasing palaeobotanical evidence for the presence of isolated tree populations in more northerly microrefugia has started to change this perception. Here we use the Northern Eurasian Plant Macrofossil Database and palaeoecological literature to show that post-glacial migration rates for trees may have been substantially lower (60-260 m yr(-1)) than those estimated by assuming migration from southern refugia only (115-550 m yr(-1)), and that early-successional trees migrated faster than mid-and late-successional trees. Post-glacial migration rates are in good agreement with those recently projected for the future with a population dynamical forest succession and dispersal model, mainly for early-successional trees and under optimal conditions. Although migration estimates presented here may be conservative because of our assumption of uniform dispersal, tree migration-rates clearly need reconsideration. We suggest that small outlier populations may be a key factor in understanding past migration rates and in predicting potential future range-shifts. The importance of outlier populations in the past may have an analogy in the future, as many tree species have been planted beyond their natural ranges, with a more beneficial microclimate than their regional surroundings. Therefore, climate-change-induced range-shifts in the future might well be influenced by such microrefugia. | ['bhagwat', 'birks', 'feurdean', 'hickler', 'lischke', 'willis'] | ","['bhagwat', 'birks', 'feurdean', 'hickler', 'lischke', 'willis']",0
225,"Holocene treeline dynamics in the mountains of northeastern British Columbia, Canada, inferred from fossil pollen and stomata | Changes in pollen and stomata assemblages in sediment cores recovered from tundra and forest-tundra lakes in alpine regions of northeastern British Columbia reflect vegetation and inferred climatic change throughout the Holocene. Pollen and stomata records are presented from two lakes, BC2 located in the alpine-tundra zone and Dead Spruce Lake at the present elevation of subalpine treeline. The pollen and stomata records from BC2 indicate that an ephemeral shrub and herb assemblage was rapidly replaced by an aspen (Populus)-spruce (Picea)-birch (Betula) woodland at similar to10600 cal. yr BP. The occurrence of stomata suggests that treeline was at least 235 m higher than present from similar to10 600 until similar to7500 cal. yr BP and temperatures were at least 1.4degreesC warmer than at present. Analyses from Dead Spruce Lake indicate that the density of trees was also higher between 9000 and 4800 cal. yr BP. High concentrations of macroscopic charcoal between similar to9800 and 8000 cal. yr BP suggest that conditions were also drier at this time. Changes in the position of treeline during the early to mid-Holocene appear to track closely shifts in climate, while forest development at our forest-tundra site reflects a combination of both heightened summer insolation and increased fire activity. The fossil stomata record from BC2 suggests that a rapid cooling event at similar to8200 cal. yr BP may have been the trigger that resulted in the downslope movement of treeline to its present elevation. Increased Picea percentages, pollen-accumulation rates (PARs) and concentration of stomata between similar to3600 and 2700 cal. yr BP provide evidence for a late-Holocene increase in forest-tundra density in response to warmer temperatures. | ['holt', 'karst', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'szeicz'] | ","['holt', 'karst', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'szeicz']",0

227,"Unlimited fuel wood during the middle Mesolithic (9650-8300 cal. yr BP) in northern Sweden: Fuel typology and pine-dominated vegetation inferred from charcoal identification and tree-ring morphology | A fuel wood analysis based on the 'Principle of Least Effort' helps to decipher the ecological limitations imposed on prehistoric hunter-gatherers. This study is based on botanical identification of wood charcoal from 'Swedish middle Mesolithic' archaeological sites dating from between ca. 9650 and 8300 cal. yr BP in northern Sweden, a period when the land was freshly released from ice cover. Charcoal fragments were analysed based on their anatomical and morphological features and anomalies. Tree-ring thickness gives an indication of the growing conditions experienced by woody plants, the tree-ring curvature provides an indication of the diameter of the pieces of wood used for fuel and the percentage of fragments with spiral thickening indicates the importance of compression or tension wood, which is related to branches or trunks stressed by snow burden or wind. Among the main woody species, the assemblages are dominated by Pinus sylvestris with some Salicaceae trees (Populus, Salix). Large wood pieces including branches were used as fuel. Several taxa were rarely recorded (Betula, Sorbus, Ericaceae) or not observed (Juniperus, Hippophae, Alnus) although their presences were expected based on other local palaeobotanical records. Because (1) charcoal of Pinus sylvestris abounds despite not being a good fuel wood and (2) certain consumable or combustible taxa are scarce (Betula) or are only present at certain sites (Salicaceae), it appears that Mesolithic hunters were not selective when choosing wood for fuel, although wood was not a limiting factor for the first settlers in northern Sweden. Pine tree-ring width range is within the modern range for the same species, indicating growing conditions similar to those experienced today. The results suggest the occurrence of woodland, probably in the lowlands. During the early-Holocene, trees rapidly covered the land after the ice-sheet melted, facilitating the life of Mesolithic hunters following reindeer herds. | ['carcaillet'] | ",['carcaillet'],2

However, much of the area deglaciated since 1950 is partly flooded most years; this has slowed succession compared to other chronosequences on glacial till. Vegetation cover, diversity, density, and plant sizes in several stands of each of seven successional stages (Barren, Isolated Plant, Patchy, Alder, Cottonwood, Spruce-Cottonwood, Spruce-Hemlock) were sampled by systematic points along line transects and belt transects. All major species were found in the Barren stage, but they differed in timing of importance in the remainder of the chronosequence. Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa (black cottonwood) was the most abundant colonizer and dominated many sites up to 150 yr after deglaciation. Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) was present throughout the chronosequence, but not in significant numbers until the Cottonwood stage. Tsuga mertensiana (mountain hemlock) was not common until it colonized dead logs and organic soils in the Spruce-Cottonwood stage. Forested sites on hillslopes above the outwash plain were dominated by P. sitchensis and T. mertensiana.

Scarce steppe-like communities with Artemisia, Poaceae, and Cyperaceac dominated during the Late Glacial. Tundra-like communities with Betula nana, Dryas, and Salix grew on more mesic sites. There are distinct climatic signals, which may be correlated with the Bolling and Allerod warming and Middle and Younger Dryas cooling. The Late Glacial/Preboreal transition, at about 10,000 C-14 yr BP, was characterized by changes from predominantly open herb communities to shrub tundra ones. Larch forest might have been established as early as 9700 9600 C-14 yr BP, whilst shrub alder came to the area ca 9500-9400 C-14 yr BP, and spruce did not reach area before ca 9200 C-14 yr BP. Spruce-larch forests with shrub alder and tree birch dominated the vegetation around the Lama Lake from ca 9000 C-14 yr BP. Dwarf birch communities were also broadly distributed. The role of spruce in the forest gradually decreased after 4500 C-14 yr BP. The vegetation cover in the Lama Lake area became similar to the modern larch-spruce forest ca 2500 C-14 yr BP. A pollen-based biome reconstruction supports a quantitative interpretation of the pollen spectra. Climate reconstructions obtained with information-statistical and plan-functi onal -type methods show very similar trends in reconstructed July temperature since ca 12,300 C-14 yr BP, while precipitation anomalies are less coherent, especially during the Late Glacial-Holocene transition.

236,"Holocene vegetation dynamics and climate change in Kamchatka Peninsula, Russian Far East | We re-examined sixteen pollen records from non-volcanic areas in the Kamchatka Peninsula to reconstruct vegetation and climate changes during the Holocene. Pollen records were first summarized and evaluated for each of three main physiographic regions: (1) Western Lowland (WL), open to the Sea of Okhotsk (6 records); (2) Central Kamchatka Depression (CKD), bordered by mountains (4 records); and (3) Eastern Coast (EC), facing the Pacific Ocean (6 records), and then compared over the peninsula. The synthesized data suggest that the climate over Kamchatka was generally wet and mild before ca. 5.8 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal. yrs BP) due to strong and prolonged maritime influence. The first forest maximum in the CKD started at ca. 8.9, indicating a warmer climate; however, forest spread along the both coasts was delayed until ca. 7 ka, suggesting a possible modulation of greater effective moisture on the coastal sites. The warmest period at ca. 7-5.8 ka is defined by the evidence of maximal forest extension overall the peninsula. During that time, birch (Betula) prevailed over alder (Alnus) in forest everywhere except in the EC. Since ca. 5.8 ka, divergent vegetation patterns became evident in northern vs. southern and coastal vs. interior sites that correspond with a shift from warmer/maritime climate to cooler/continental climate. Also, greater climate variability accompanied the Neoglacial cooling since 5.8 ka. This climate cooling, indicated by drastic shrub expansion, advanced southward from the northern coasts (ca. 5.8 ka) to the central interior and coastal areas (ca. 5 ka) and then to the south (ca. 3.5 ka). Subsequent warming, suggested by the evidence of a second forest maximum, advanced westward from the EC (ca. 5.2 ka) to the CKD (ca. 3.2 ka) and then to the WL (ca. 1.9 ka). An advance of larch (Larix) in the CKD since ca. 3.2 ka points to increased climate continentality and larger seasonal variations. In contrast, alder forest spread after ca. 1.7 ka, reported only from the southern EC and CKD sites, indicates a mild, maritime-like climate that also agrees with the first apparent advance of spruce (Picea) in the interior. The latest cooling event, indicated by another shrub expansion, shows eastward trend: it occurred much earlier at the WL (ca. 2.4-1.6 ka) then at the EC (ca. 900-350 cal. yrs BP), and was less evident in the CKD. Instead, there was a remarkable coniferous expansion during the last millennium when both larch and spruce invaded and replaced deciduous forests so that by ca. 450-320 cal. yrs BP, an extensive coniferous forest (""Coniferous Island"") appeared in the interior of Kamchatka. Since ca. 300 cal. yrs BP, spruce expanded most rapidly what broadly coincides with the beginning of the Little Ice Age. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

237,"Vegetation and environment in eastern North America during the Last Glacial Maximum | Knowledge of the vegetation and environment of eastern North America during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is important to understanding postglacial vegetational and biogeographic dynamics, assessing climate sensitivity, and constraining and evaluating earth-system models. Our understanding of LGM conditions in the region has been hampered by low site density, problems of data quality (particularly dating), and the possibility that LGM vegetation and climate lacked modern analogs. In order to generate improved reconstructions of LGM vegetation and environment, we assembled pollen and plant macrofossil data from 21 and 17 well-dated LGM sites, respectively. All sites have assemblages within the LGM timespan of 21,000 ¬± 1500 calendar yr BP. Based on these data, we prepared maps of isopolls, macrofossil presence/absence, pollen-analogs, biomes, inferred mean January and July temperatures and mean annual precipitation for the LGM. Tundra and open Picea-dominated forest grew along the Laurentide ice sheet, with tundra predominantly in the west. In the east, Pinus-dominated vegetation (mainly P. banksiana with local P. resinosa and P. strobus) occurred extensively to 34¬∞N and possibly as far south as 30¬∞N. Picea glauca and a now-extinct species, P. critchfieldii, occurred locally. Picea-dominated forest grew in the continental interior, with temperate hardwoods (Quercus, Carya, Juglans, Liriodendron, Fagus, Ulmus) growing locally near the Lower Mississippi Valley at least as far north as 35¬∞N. Picea critchfieldii was the dominant species in this region. The Florida peninsula was occupied by open vegetation with warm-temperate species of Pinus. Eastern Texas was occupied by open vegetation with at least local Quercus and Picea. Extensive areas of peninsular Florida and the continental interior had vegetation unmatched by any modern pollen samples. The paleovegetational data indicate more extensive cooling in eastern North America at the LGM than simulated by either the NCAR CCM0 or CCM1 climate models. The occurrence of cool-temperate conifers and hardwoods as far north as 34-35¬∞N, however, indicates less severe cooling than some previous reconstructions. Paleoclimate inferences for the LGM are complicated by lowered atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which may be responsible for the open nature and dominance of conifers in LGM vegetation.

239,"The Holocene vegetation history of Iceland, state-of-the-art and future research | In the Late Preboreal and Early Boreal Chronozones dwarf-shrub heath and shrub heath, followed by juniper and mountain birch copses, replaced snow beds and fell-field vegetation characteristic of the Lateglacial/Early Preboreal newly deglaciated landscape of Iceland. During the Late Boreal and Early Atlantic Chronozones birch woodland established itself in the more favourable places, especially fjord lowlands and inland valleys. The development of birch woodland suffered a setback due to a transient climatic oscillation some 7500 C-14 years ago, but recovered again relatively quickly and more than 6000 C-14 years ago birch woodland covered the lowland areas both in northern and southern Iceland. At that time it reached its highest altitude, at least in northern Iceland. During the Late Atlantic and Subboreal Chronozones the birch woodland showed a retrogressive succession towards a more open landscape with expanding mires and heaths. There is some conflict between the evidence from pollen percentages, which indicate that the woodland regenerated several times during the latter half of the Holocene, and pollen influx values which reflect no such regeneration of the woodland. New habitats were created for birch after a period of cool climate and instability during the Early Subatlantic Chronozone as fresh screes and sandur plains became vegetated, at least partly, by woodland. This development was halted at the beginning of the Norse settlement, which resulted in further opening of the woodland. The birch woodland closest to the farms in the lowland of Iceland was cut and utilized for timber and fuel. Grazing of domestic animals opened the landscape still further and the previous woodland never re-established itself. This happened within only half a century from the arrival of the first settlers. During the ensuing 1100 years of human influence the sub-alpine birch woodland has been so intensively utilized that only in fenced, protected areas and at the most inaccessible and remote places has birch survived. The shrub and dwarf-shrub heaths, widespread mires, fell fields, and hay fields so characteristic for the Icelandic landscape at present thus developed as a relatively recent phenomenon in the form in which they appear today. A number of areas are identified for future research: elucidating the origins of the Icelandic flora, deriving palaeoclimatic data from the vegetation record, correlating terrestrial with marine and ice core records and expanding our understanding of the human impact on vegetation. | ['caseldine', 'hallsdottir'] | ","['caseldine', 'hallsdottir']",1

Another difference from the climax of southeastern Alaska lies in the abundant presence of areas of 'tundra', which shows two intergrading phases, Empetrum heath and Carex bog. Forest, heath, and bog are in fairly stable adjustment with environment, and it seems logical to consider the entire complex as a transitional climax between forest and tundra. The major fiords fall into two classes in the first the walls are clothed with forest-tundra vegetation essentially like that of the open shores; in the second forest is reduced to small patches, and Alder thicket is the most conspicuous type. The second type is far more under the influence of great glaciers and extensive snow fields, and penetrates deep into high mountain masses. The hypothesis is offered that the 'present' in coastal Alaska is a time of ice expansion on a scale not equalled during many centuries of the past. It is further suggested that the preceding period of contraction was of so great magnitude as to be a major event of middle post-Pleistocene time and that it corresponds with the warm or warm-dry (xerothermic) period.

243,"Vegetation response to global and regional environmental change on the taymyr peninsula during the holocene | The author uses plant residue from peat bog deposits and palynological data to reconstruct past climatic conditions of the Holocene period for the Taymyr Peninsula of northern central Siberia. More specifically, four general climatic periods, each with their specific vegetation communities, are identified for the period from 9000 B. P. to the present: Boreal, Atlantic, Sub‚ÄêBoreal, and Sub‚ÄêAtlantic. Three landscape‚Äêclimatic periods have been identified with an elevated thermal regime, with the warmest conditions prevailing during the Boreal Period. The last thousand years has been characterized by the northward expansion of larch and the northeastward movement of spruce and certain boreal taiga grass‚Äêherb species. ¬© 1995 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. | ['koshkarova'] | ",['koshkarova'],2
244,"The Holocene vegetational development of the Godthabsfjord area, West Greenland | The vegetation which invaded the deglaciated soil was open but rich in species, and 64 species or genera have been determined from the pioneer stage (c9400-8000 BP). Open soil plants dominated, but dwarf-shrubs entered the vegetation, with species from snow- patches and snow-covered heaths dominating in the beginning. By c8000 BP Salix glauca and S. herbacea immigrated, and gradually the pioneer plants and chionophilous dwarf-shrubs were decimated. This Salix-Cyperaceae stage lasted until c6300 BP, when Betula nana spread all over the area within a few centuries. A B. nana- Juniperus stage lasted until c3500 BP. In the subcontinental interior this was followed by an Alnus crispa-B. nana stage, which in turn was replaced by a B. nana-Ericales stage c1800 BP. Alnus has never been able to grow at the maritime outer coast, where Betula, Cyperaceae, Empetrum and other Ericales dominated after 3500 BP. Later, Empetrum, Cyperaceae and snowbed plants gradually spread at the expense of B. nana. After deglaciation the temperature reached today's values between 8000 and 7500 BP. Survey of the immigration or first appearance of some species palynologically important to South and West Greenland shows big timelags in the spreading of some species, eg Thalictrum and Angelica, whereas others, like Empetrum and Juniperus, have a more effective dispersal capacity.-from Author Salix glauca Salix herbacea Cyperaceae Betula nana Alnus crispa Empetrum Ericales Thalictrum Angelica Juniperus | ['fredskild'] | ",['fredskild'],3

The maximal annual water-level fluctuation is about 5 m. A vegetation map was made and the plant communities along a belt transect were analyzed. The height and breast height diameter of all trees within the sample plot were measured and their basal area growth was calculated. The history of the study area from 1790-1977 was studied by dendrochronology. Changes during this period were initiated and directed by forest fires, selective felling, cattle grazing, artificial lowering of the lake level and ice-erosion of the shores. Human interference seems particularly to have affected forest composition. | ['zackrisson'] | ",['zackrisson'],2

247,"The woodland in Fljotsdalsherao during the last 2000 years | The woodland in Fljotsdalsherao during the last 2000 yearsThe object of this study is to obtain data highlighting the vegetation history of Fljotsdalsherao region, eastern Iceland, over the last 2000 years, in order to understand the observed decline of the region's birch forests. The study is based on two different datasets. Firstly, an extensive study was carried out on historical records concerning vegetation and climate in eastern Iceland since the settlement of the country. Secondly, a pollen analytical study was carried out on sediment-core samples from a small pond within the present border of Hallormsstaoarskogur forest. The studied core segment covers roughly the last 2000 years.The core consisted of fairly homogeneous limnic sediment with multiple tephra layers. A tephrocronology was constructed for the core, based on six identified tephra layers. The pollen analytical results were divided up into six pollen assembly zones, each representing different vegetation conditions. These zones were used to interpret the vegetation history. By the time of the settlement of Iceland in the late 9th century, birch forest surrounded the study site, but the forest declined and retreated very rapidly subsequent to the settlement. Beginning in the 15th century, the forest recovered considerably and remained stable until the middle of the 18th century when it started to decline very fast. This decline continued until the beginning of the 20th century when the forest was put under conservation, and fenced off from grazing.This study suggests that effects of human activity have been the dominating factor over climate and volcanism in controlling the condition of the forest since the settlement. | ['eggertsson', 'ingolfsson', 'jonsson'] | ","['eggertsson', 'ingolfsson', 'jonsson']",4
248,"Woodland in the neolithic of Northern Europe: The forest as ancestor | The Neolithic period is one of the great transformations in human history - when agriculture first began and dramatic changes occurred in human society. These changes occurred in environments that were radically different to those that exist today, and in northern Europe many landscapes would have been dominated by woodland. Yet wood and woodland rarely figures in the minds of many archaeologists, and it plays no part in the traditional Three Age system that has defined the frameworks of European prehistory. This book explores how human-environment relations altered with the beginnings of farming, and how the Neolithic in northern Europe was made possible through new ways of living in and understanding the environment. Drawing on a broad range of evidence, from pollen data and stone axes to the remains of timber monuments and settlements, the book analyzes the relationship between people, their material culture, and their woodland environment. ¬© Gordon Noble 2017. | ['noble'] | ",['noble'],2
249,"Younger Dryas and Early Holocene Peats from northern Far East Russia | Macrofossil remains from dated peat sections help clarify paleoclimate patterns inferred from subtle changes in the palynological data from the northern Russian Far East. These data show latitudinal range extensions for tree Betula. Larix gmelinii, and Picea sp., as well as the occurrence of tree-sized shrubs of Duschekia fruticosa and Salix sp. in areas that today are low shrub tundra. Ages of extralimital taxa suggest a postglacial thermal maximum between similar to 11,000 and 8100 C-14 BP including a region-wide, warm Younger Dryas. This warm interval contrasts to other areas of Siberia where the thermal optimum is similar to 9000-4000 C-14 BP. Additionally, macrofossils suggest that Holocene changes in northern treeline were not synchronous. In the Far East, treeline advance and retreat occurred earlier by similar to 1000 C-14 y and similar to 4000 C-14 y, respectively, as compared to other areas of Russia. Basal and minimum ages of peat deposits indicate that the Early Holocene was a particularly important time for peat initiation and accumulation across northern Siberia.

0,"Accumulation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Hummocky Tundra Peatlands under Climate Change at High Latitudes | The quantitative and qualitative compositions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined, and the vertical stratification of PAHs was characterized along profiles in hummocky tundra peatlands. In perennially frozen peat layers, PAHs occur in a conserved state and do not undergo transformation in contrast to seasonally thawed layers. Statistically significant correlations were detected between the mass fraction of 5-6-ring structures (especially, benzo[ghi]perylene), individual PAHs, and botanical composition of the peat at the thawing-freezing boundary; and profile relations for various combinations of PAHs were calculated. The radiocarbon and paleobotanical analysis of peatlands in combination with the obtained results can be used for assignment of initial vegetation to periods of peat formation in the Holocene and as markers of the response of the peatland permafrost to climate changes at high latitudes. | ['beznosikov', 'gabov', 'yakovleva'] | ","['beznosikov', 'gabov', 'yakovleva']",3
1,"Adding precision to the spatial factor of vegetation reconstructed from pollen assemblages | A pollen diagram from a small lake, Kutulabdenlampi, in northern Finland is interpreted in terms of the development of forest vegetation during the Holocene. The abundance of each of the forest taxa is considered independently by means of pollen accumulation rates (PARs), using as the reference material, long term average pollen deposition values monitored by a network of pollen traps. Particular attention is paid to the arrival of spruce and to the species in the original forests that this newcomer replaces. A model of pollen dispersal and deposition developed by Sugita is used to estimate the area around the lake that the pollen assemblage is most clearly reflecting. This relevant source area of pollen (RSAP), for the present day situations is c. 1,500 m. Pollen loadings calculated for a simulated landscape that mimics (i) that of the present day and (ii) for the situation at 8,000 BP (as deduced from the PARs) are compared with the pollen assemblages from the diagram at those points in time, and are seen to be compatible. The advantages of combining PAR and modelling to look at the spatial scale of vegetation reconstructions are discussed. | ['hick', 'sunnari'] | ","['hick', 'sunnari']",0
2,"AFLP markers reveal high clonal diversity and extreme longevity in four key arctic-alpine species | We investigated clonal diversity, genet size structure and genet longevity in populations of four arctic-alpine plants (Carex curvula, Dryas octopetala, Salix herbacea and Vaccinium uliginosum) to evaluate their persistence under past climatic oscillations and their potential resistance to future climate change. The size and number of genets were determined by an analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms and a standardized sampling design in several European arctic-alpine populations, where these species are dominant in the vegetation. Genet age was estimated by dividing the size by the annual horizontal size increment from in situ growth measurements. Clonal diversity was generally high but differed among species, and the frequency distribution of genet size was strongly left-skewed. The largest C.similar to urvula genet had an estimated minimum age of c. 4100 years and a maximum age of c. 5000 years, although 84.8% of the genets in this species were <200 years old. The oldest genets of D.similar to octopetala, S.similar to herbacea and V.similar to uliginosum were found to be at least 500, 450 and 1400 years old, respectively. These results indicate that individuals in the studied populations have survived pronounced climatic oscillations, including the Little Ice Age and the postindustrial warming. The presence of genets in all size classes and the dominance of presumably young individuals suggest repeated recruitment over time, a precondition for adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Together, persistence and continuous genet turnover may ensure maximum ecosystem resilience. Thus, our results indicate that long-lived clonal plants in arctic-alpine ecosystems can persist, despite considerable climatic change. | ['armbruster', 'gielly', 'stocklin', 'taberlet', 'de', 'witte'] | ","['armbruster', 'gielly', 'stocklin', 'taberlet', 'de', 'witte']",0
3,"Age and impacts of the caldera-forming Aniakchak II eruption in western Alaska | The mid-Holocene eruption of Aniakchak volcano (Aniakchak II) in southwest Alaska was among the largest eruptions globally in the last 10,000 years (VEI-6). Despite evidence for possible impacts on global climate, the precise age of the eruption is not well-constrained and little is known about regional environmental impacts. A closely spaced sequence of radiocarbon dates at a peatland site over 1000 km from the volcano show that peat accumulation was greatly reduced with a hiatus of approximately 90-120 yr following tephra deposition. During this inferred hiatus no paleoenvironmental data are available but once vegetation returned the flora changed from a Cyperaceae-dominated assemblage to a Poaceae-dominated vegetation cover, suggesting a drier and/or more nutrient-rich ecosystem. Oribatid mites are extremely abundant in the peat at the depth of the ash, and show a longer-term, increasingly wet peat surface across the tephra layer. The radiocarbon sample immediately below the tephra gave a date of 1636-1446 cal yr BC suggesting that the eruption might be younger than previously thought Our findings suggest that the eruption may have led to a widespread reduction in peatland carbon sequestration and that the impacts on ecosystem functioning were profound and long-lasting.

5,"Past Arctic aliens have passed away, current ones may stay | Increased human activity and climate change are expected to increase the numbers and impact of alien species in the Arctic, but knowledge of alien species is poor in most Arctic regions. Through field investigations over the last 10¬†years, and review of alien vascular plant records for the high Arctic Archipelago Svalbard over the past 130¬†years, we explored long term trends in persistence and phenology. In total, 448 observations of 105 taxa have been recorded from 28 sites. Recent surveys at 18 of these sites revealed that alien species had disappeared at half of them. Investigations at a further 49 sites characterised by former human activity and/or current tourist landing sites did not reveal any alien species. Patterns of alien species distribution suggest that greater alien species richness is more likely to be aligned with ongoing human inhabitation than sites of transient use. The probability of an alien species being in a more advanced phenological stage increased with higher mean July temperatures. As higher mean July temperatures are positively correlated with more recent year, the latter finding suggests a clear warming effect on the increased reproductive potential of alien plants, and thus an increased potential for spread in Svalbard. Given that both human activity and temperatures are expected to increase in the future, there is need to respond in policy and action to reduce the potential for further alien species introduction and spread in the Arctic. ¬© 2015, The Author(s). | ['alsos', 'elven', 'ware'] | ","['alsos', 'elven', 'ware']",0
6,"A 24,000-year ancient DNA and pollen record from the Polar Urals reveals temporal dynamics of arctic and boreal plant communities | A 24,000-year record of plant community dynamics, based on pollen and ancient DNA from the sediments (sedaDNA) of Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye in the Polar Ural Mountains, provides detailed information on the flora of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and also changes in plant community composition and dominance. It greatly improves on incomplete records from short and fragmented stratigraphic sequences found in exposed sedimentary sections in the western Russian Arctic. In total, 162 plant taxa were detected by sedaDNA and 115 by pollen analysis. Several shifts in dominance between and within plant functional groups occurred over the studied period, but most taxa appear to have survived in situ. A diverse arctic-alpine herb flora characterised the interval ca. 24,000-17,000 cal years BP and persisted into the Holocene. Around 17,000 cal years BP, sedges (e.g. Carex) and bryophytes (e.g. Bryum, Aulacomnium) increased. The establishment of shrub-tundra communities of Dryas and Vaccinium sp., with potentially some Betula pubescens trees (influx similar to 290 grains cm(2) year(-1)) followed at ca. 15,000 cal years BP. Forest taxa such as Picea and ferns (e.g. Dryopteris fragrans, Gymnocarpium dryopteris) established near the lake from ca. 10,000 cal years BP, followed by the establishment of Larix trees from ca. 9000 cal years BP. Picea began to decline from ca. 7000 cal years BP. A complete withdrawal of forest tree taxa occurred by ca. 4000 cal years BP, presumably due to decreasing growing-season temperatures, allowing the expansion of dwarf-shrub tundra and a diverse herb community similar to the present-day vegetation mosaic. Contrary to some earlier comparative studies, sedaDNA and pollen from Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye showed high similarity in the timing of compositional changes and the occurrence of key plant taxa. The sedaDNA record revealed several features that the pollen stratigraphy and earlier palaeorecords in the region failed to detect; a sustained, long-term increase in floristic richness since the LGM until the early Holocene, turnover in grass and forb genera over the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, persistence of a diverse arctic-alpine flora over the late Quaternary, and a variable bryophyte flora through time. As pollen records are often limited by taxonomic resolution, differential productivity and dispersal, sedaDNA can provide improved estimates of floristic richness and is better able to distinguish between different plant assemblages. However, pollen remains superior at providing quantitative estimates of plant abundance changes and detecting several diverse groups (e.g. Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Asteraceae) which may be underreported in the sedaDNA. Joint use of the two proxies provided unprecedented floristic detail of past plant communities and helped to distinguish between long-distance transport of pollen and local presence, particularly for woody plant taxa.

7,"Ancient DNA reveals lack of postglacial habitat tracking in the arctic fox | How species respond to an increased availability of habitat, for example at the end of the last glaciation, has been well established. In contrast, little is known about the opposite process, when the amount of habitat decreases. The hypothesis of habitat tracking predicts that species should be able to track both increases and decreases in habitat availability. The alternative hypothesis is that populations outside refugia become extinct during periods of unsuitable climate. To test these hypotheses, we used ancient DNA techniques to examine genetic variation in the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) through an expansion/contraction cycle. The results show that the arctic fox in midlatitude Europe became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene and did not track the habitat when it shifted to the north. Instead, a high genetic similarity between the extant populations in Scandinavia and Siberia suggests an eastern origin for the Scandinavian population at the end of the last glaciation. These results provide new insights into how species respond to climate change, since they suggest that populations are unable to track decreases in habitat availability. This implies that arctic species may be particularly vulnerable to increases in global temperatures. | ['angerbjorn', 'arcuaga', 'dalen', 'germonpre', 'gotherstrom', 'nystrom', 'sablin', 'turner', 'valdiosera'] | ","['angerbjorn', 'arcuaga', 'dalen', 'germonpre', 'gotherstrom', 'nystrom', 'sablin', 'turner', 'valdiosera']",3
8,"Antagonistic interaction networks are structured independently of latitude and host guild | An increase in species richness with decreasing latitude is a prominent pattern in nature. However, it remains unclear whether there are corresponding latitudinal gradients in the properties of ecological interaction networks. We investigated the structure of 216 quantitative antagonistic networks comprising insect hosts and their parasitoids, drawn from 28 studies from the High Arctic to the tropics. Key metrics of network structure were strongly affected by the size of the interaction matrix (i.e. the total number of interactions documented between individuals) and by the taxonomic diversity of the host taxa involved. After controlling for these sampling effects, quantitative networks showed no consistent structural patterns across latitude and host guilds, suggesting that there may be basic rules for how sets of antagonists interact with resource species. Furthermore, the strong association between network size and structure implies that many apparent spatial and temporal variations in network structure may prove to be artefacts. ¬© 2013 The Authors.

9,"Applications of the Siberian vegetation model to spatio-temporal studies of climate and plant cover | A regional bioclimatic vegetation model for Siberia was used to evaluate possible changes in the main vegetation zones under climate warming and to reconstruct the palaeoclimate during the mid-Holocene. The model predicted vegetation zones from temperature sums (base 5 degrees C), a dryness index, and a continentality index. Vegetation shifts were predicted by coupling the model with four climate change scenarios (general circulation models) assuming a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. The model predicted that the vegetation of Siberia will be almost completely rearranged as a result of climatic warming. Zones will shift northward and large reductions of major taiga subzones will occur. Coupling the model with the palaeovegetation map of Khotinsky, January and July temperatures and annual precipitation are reconstructed for each zone. Climate changes since the mid-Holocene are displayed as anomalies by comparing reconstructed and current climates. On average, the Siberian palaeoclimate was warmer and moister than at the present. Most of warming and increased precipitation which promoted dark coniferous forests to advance deep into the continent during the mid-Holocene were concentrated in East Siberia where larch is currently found. | ['chebakova', 'denisenko', 'monserud', 'parfenova'] | ","['chebakova', 'denisenko', 'monserud', 'parfenova']",3
10,"Applying Bayesian statistics to organism-based environmental reconstruction | Reconstruction of environmental conditions from biological indicators, such as chironomids, can provide valuable insight into the variance of natural systems and the extent of current environmental problems. Various numerical techniques have been developed for this challenging task, based on different models and assumptions, but ignoring some of the uncertainties inherent in the reconstruction. We study the use of Bayesian modeling and inference in organism-based palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. We propose a Bayesian model, BUM, and compare it empirically with eight other methods, including the widely used weighted averaging (WA) technique. The methods are evaluated on a surface-sediment chironomid training data set from 53 subarctic lakes in northern Fennoscandia by comparing the prediction statistics of these data. The resulting calibration models are also applied to fossil chironomid assemblages in order to evaluate the differences in Holocene temperature reconstructions. The empirical results indicate that BUM is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We also describe a generic Bayesian framework for reconstruction, to demonstrate Bayesian tools for reasoning with a variety of ecological response models. Bayesian statistics support the ""classical"" approach to regression and calibration whereas the state-of-the-art methods, including WA, are based on the conceptually more controversial ""inverse"" approach. Further, the use of probability distributions rather than point estimates for species responses gives a principled method for handling uncertainty in response modeling. | ['korhola', 'mannila', 'olander', 'toivonen'] | ","['korhola', 'mannila', 'olander', 'toivonen']",3
11,"Holocene aquatic ecosystem change in the boreal vegetation zone of northern Finland | We studied multiple variables in a sediment core from Lake Kipojarvi, northern Finland, to investigate Holocene ecosystem changes in relation to catchment characteristics and known climate variations. We focused on a forested catchment because previous paleolimnological studies conducted in Fennoscandia focused mainly on subarctic lakes within a range of shifting treeline(s). Data on aquatic macrophytes, diatoms, Cladocera, C:N ratio, organic matter (LOI) and regional vegetation (pollen), revealed a three-phase limnological development. The early Holocene, species-rich, mesotrophic lake was transformed into an oligotrophic, species-poor aquatic ecosystem by the early middle Holocene, ca. 7,500 cal years BP, earlier than has generally been reported. The transition involved considerable changes in aquatic macrophytes. Changes in the Cladocera and diatom communities appear to have been linked to aquatic macrophyte development, which in turn, was probably regulated by catchment development and hydrology, and a consequent decrease in nutrient input from the catchment. During the more humid late Holocene, surface flow from the catchment probably increased, but the lake's nutrient status remained oligotrophic. Possible reasons for low nutrient concentration in the late Holocene include: 1) slower biogeochemical cycling due to cooler climate, 2) a new hydrologic outlet and associated shorter water-retention times, and 3) accelerated peatland development in the catchment that affected water flow patterns and nutrient cycling. | ['alkio', 'juutinen', 'seppa', 'siitonen', 'tuittila', 'valiranta', 'weckstrom'] | ","['alkio', 'juutinen', 'seppa', 'siitonen', 'tuittila', 'valiranta', 'weckstrom']",3
12,"Archaeol as a methanogen biomarker in ombrotrophic bogs | In order to develop new tools in the reconstruction of microbiological processes in ancient continental settings, we determined the concentration of archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol in four Holocene ombrotrophic peatlands, spanning a range of European climate zones. Neither ether lipid was present in the aerobic acrotelm peat, consistent with an origin from anaerobic archaea, presumably methanogens. At the depth of the maximum seasonal water table, archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol concentration markedly increased at all four sites, again consistent with an anaerobic source, but differed strongly among sites. The differences apparently reflect a combination of vegetation - ericaceous and graminoid plants as opposed to Sphagnum spp. and other mosses lacking root systems - and temperature influence on methanogenesis. In particular, low ether lipid concentrations in Finland probably reflect the lack of vascular vegetation possessing well-developed root systems, together with low mean annual temperature. Similarly low concentrations of archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol in a German bog likely result from winter temperatures below 0 degrees C and a relatively shorter growing season. The occurrence of sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol is limited to a narrow and shallow depth range, indicating that it is poorly preserved, but archaeol persists throughout the cores. Decoupling the concentration of archaeol and the more labile sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol below ca. 50 cm suggests that the former records fossil biomass rather than living biomass. If so, then downcore variation in archaeol concentration likely reflects past changes in methane cycling, and archaeol, pending further developmental research, could serve as a new tool for reconstruction of past peatland biogeochemistry.

13,"Arctic Archaeology and Climate Change | An enduring debate in the field of Arctic archaeology has been the extent to which climate change impacted cultural developments in the past. Long-term culture change across the circumpolar Arctic was often highly dynamic, with episodes of rapid migration, regional abandonment, and-in some cases-the disappearance or wholesale replacement of entire cultural traditions. By the 1960s, researchers were exploring the possibility that warming episodes had positive effects on cold-adapted premodern peoples in the Arctic by (a) reducing the extent of sea ice, (b) expanding the size and range of marine mammal populations, and (c) opening new waterways and hunting areas for marine-adapted human groups. Although monocausal climatic arguments for change are now regarded as overly simplistic, the growing threat of contemporary Arctic warming to Indigenous livelihoods has given wider relevance to research into long-term culture-climate interactions. With their capacity to examine deeper cultural responses to climate change, archaeologists are in a unique position to generate human-scale climate adaptation insights that may inform future planning and mitigation efforts. The exceptionally well-preserved cultural and paleo-ecological sequences of the Arctic make it one of the best-suited regions on Earth to address such problems. Ironically, while archaeologists employ an exciting and highly promising new generation of methods and approaches to examine long-term fragility and resilience in Arctic social-ecological systems, many of these frozen paleo-societal archives are fast disappearing due to anthropogenic warming. | ['desjardins', 'jordan'] | ","['desjardins', 'jordan']",0

15,"Aridity on the Canadian plains | The Prairie Ecozone is the only major region of Canada where drought is a landscape hazard; aridity is linked to soil erosion. Management of prairie ecosystems and soil landscapes therefore requires an understanding of past and future trends and variability in regional aridity. We used instrumental and paleoclimatic records to define a regional baseline for prairie aridity, to evaluate the utility of modern climate normals (i.e. 1961-1990) as a benchmark for future climatic change, and to provide a historical context for a range of General Circulation Model (GCM) forecasts of regional aridity. A warmdry scenario derived from the Canadian GCM projects a significant increase in the area of subhumid and semiarid climate. Tree rings and diatom-inferred lake salinity record prolonged arid events and show that the climate normal period of 1961-1990 may have been the most benign climate of the past 750 years. The climate of the 20th century was anomalous in terms of the absence of sustained drought. Because both lake and treering analyses recorded an abrupt amelioration of climatic conditions near the start of the instrumental record, we suggest that the immediate impacts of future global warming may be to return the prairies to past conditions in which persistent aridity was recorded for intervals of decades or longer. | ['barrow', 'hopkinson', 'leavitt', 'sauchyn'] | ","['barrow', 'hopkinson', 'leavitt', 'sauchyn']",0
16,"Assessing the effects of multiple environmental stressors on zooplankton assemblages in Boreal Shield lakes since pre-industrial times | Zooplankton communities in Boreal Shield lakes of south-central Ontario, Canada, have become increasingly exposed to the effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors, such as declines in calcium (Ca) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, shifts in predation regimes, and climate warming. The paleolimnological approach provides an effective means of examining cladoceran zooplankton communities prior to the onset of these major environmental stressors and assessing how the increasing impacts of these stressors have affected zooplankton community composition. We examined the chitinized remains of cladocerans from recent and pre-industrial (pre- similar to 1850s) sediments in 42 oligotrophic lakes from south-central Ontario and compared these assemblages using ANOSIM and SIMPER. Differences in cladoceran assemblages since pre-industrial times were related to Jive environmental variables that significantly influence cladoceran community composition in surface sediments. These included measured physical (depth), chemical [Ca, pH, sulphate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)], and biological (fish community biomass) limnological variables. Two changes were recorded in the cladoceran species assemblages of the study lakes. The first was a significant increase in the ratio of pelagic species compared to littoral species over time in most lakes which we cannot attribute to any measured environmental variable with certainty but it likely represents a multiple stressor effect. The second was changes in relative abundances of daphniid cladocerans in several lakes since pre-industrial times, which we attribute to the interactive effects of several environmental stressors, including: differences in Ca availability within our lakes, resulting in decreased abundances of daphniids over time in lakes with lower Ca levels; long-term increases in DOC concentrations, which may provide refuge for daphniids from visual predators; and long-term declines in TP concentrations which may contribute to the dominance of species that are more efficient grazers, such as daphniids. Overall, this study provides field-based evidence that the modern-day cladoceran communities in south-central Ontario lakes are different than they were prior to human settlement in the region, and therefore these paleolimnological data provide a long-term, historical component to contemporary cladoceran datasets and an extended perspective on how multiple environmental stressors have impacted aquatic organisms from Boreal Shield lakes. | ['desellas', 'paterson', 'smol', 'sweetman'] | ","['desellas', 'paterson', 'smol', 'sweetman']",3
17,"Assessing environmental stressors on a commercial walleye fishery from a large northern ecosystem (Tathlina Lake) using water chemistry and paleolimnology | Tathlina Lake (Northwest Territories, Canada) is a large, shallow ecosystem in the rapidly warming northern boreal forest. This lake is of considerable cultural and economic significance as it supports a commercially important walleye (Sander vitreus) fishery that has experienced large fluctuations since the 1940s, the causes of which are poorly understood. Here we used paleolimnology to describe long-term environmental changes in the lake that may have contributed to recent collapses in walleye populations. The sub-fossil remains of diatoms and chironomids were used to assess changes in turbidity, nutrients, and oxygen levels, all of which are important to walleye. Minimal changes have occurred in diatom assemblages from the early 1920s to present, suggesting that turbidity and nutrients have not changed markedly in the lake. Hypoxia-tolerant chironomid taxa were found throughout the sediment record, and our modern water chemistry showed that oxygen levels were supersaturated in the summer, but close to the lower tolerance limit of walleye in winter. An increase in sedimentary chlorophyll-a since similar to 1940 suggests Tathlina Lake is affected by recent climate warming. Our findings indicate that walleye populations are likely regularly exposed to hypoxic winter conditions, which may increase the sensitivity of the population to other interacting stressors that occur with recent climate warming. Long-term records of environmental change in large, shallow northern lakes are rare, and paleolimnology provides a framework to reconstruct missing monitoring data, especially in lakes that are economically and culturally important to northern communities.

18,"Assessing long-term changes in aquatic ecosystems near a small conventional oil and gas operation in the cameron hills, southern northwest territories, Canada | The Cameron Hills is a freshwater-rich region located at the border of Alberta and the Northwest Territories and is the site of a small, remote oil and gas operation. Ecological monitoring data are scarce in the Cameron Hills, and absent prior to the onset of oil and gas development in the 1960s. Consequently, the potential impacts of industrial activities on freshwater ecosystems in the Cameron Hills are unknown. Identifying ecosystem responses to industrial activities is further confounded by the effects of climate change, as this region has undergone substantial warming since ~1900. To address this important knowledge gap, we used an integrated spatial and temporal approach to investigate how climate warming and industrial activities may have altered water quality in the region. Water samples and sediment cores were collected from lakes with varying degrees of catchment disturbance related to oil and gas activities. Comparison of catchment characteristics and modern water chemistry data suggest that catchment disturbance may be increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export to lakes. Additionally, lakes in close proximity to the central battery exhibit lower pH than more distant lakes, which may be due to inputs of organic acids. Changes in diatom assemblages preserved in a dated sediment core from a lake with a disturbed catchment are consistent with modern water chemistry, indicating a trend toward increasing DOC and decreasing pH. Despite evidence of localized impacts related to oil and gas activities, changes in diatom assemblages suggest that regionally climate warming is currently the dominant driver of changes in lakes in the Cameron Hills. ¬© 2019 E.

19,"Assessing performance and seasonal bias of pollen-based climate reconstructions in a perfect model world | Reconstructions of summer, winter or annual mean temperatures based on the species composition of bio-indicators such as pollen, foraminifera or chironomids are routinely used in climate model-proxy data comparison studies. Most reconstruction algorithms exploit the joint distribution of modern spatial climate and species distribution for the development of the reconstructions. They rely on the space-for-time substitution and the specific assumption that environmental variables other than those reconstructed are not important or that their relationship with the reconstructed variable(s) should be the same in the past as in the modern spatial calibration dataset. Here we test the implications of this ""correlative uniformitarianism"" assumption on climate reconstructions in an ideal model world, in which climate and vegetation are known at all times. The alternate reality is a climate simulation of the last 6000 years with dynamic vegetation. Transient changes of plant functional types are considered as surrogate pollen counts and allow us to establish, apply and evaluate transfer functions in the modeled world. We find that in our model experiments the transfer function cross validation r(2) is of limited use to identify reconstructible climate variables, as it only relies on the modern spatial climate-vegetation relationship. However, ordination approaches that assess the amount of fossil vegetation variance explained by the reconstructions are promising. We furthermore show that correlations between climate variables in the modern climate-vegetation relationship are systematically extended into the reconstructions. Summer temperatures, the most prominent driving variable for modeled vegetation change in the Northern Hemisphere, are accurately reconstructed. However, the amplitude of the model winter and mean annual temperature cooling between the mid-Holocene and present day is overestimated and similar to the summer trend in magnitude. This effect occurs because temporal changes of a dominant climate variable, such as summer temperatures in the model's Arctic, are imprinted on a less important variable, leading to reconstructions biased towards the dominant variable's trends. Our results, although based on a model vegetation that is inevitably simpler than reality, indicate that reconstructions of multiple climate variables based on modern spatial bio-indicator datasets should be treated with caution. Expert knowledge on the ecophysiological drivers of the proxies, as well as statistical methods that go beyond the cross validation on modern calibration datasets, are crucial to avoid misinterpretation. | ['laepple', 'rehfeld', 'telford', 'trachsel'] | ","['laepple', 'rehfeld', 'telford', 'trachsel']",1
20,"An assessment of the influence of land cover uncertainties on the simulation of global climate in the early Holocene | Six and 21 kyear BP represent the extreme states of climate since the last glacial maximum. The early Holocene, in contrast, was a time of transition, experiencing rapidly melting continental ice sheets, rising sea-level, and increasing summer insolation. Key features of the climate, illustrated by an NCAR CCM3 general circulation model experiment representing 11 kyr BP, include enhanced continentality and seasonality, and an enhanced northern monsoon. The principal circulation responses to the 11 kyr BP boundary conditions can be summarized as an intensification and northward shift of the mean meridional circulation and an intensification of the planetary wave structure of the Northern Hemisphere in northern summer, and a slight intensification of the mean meridional circulation coupled with a southward shift in the planetary wave structure in northern winter. These changes are manifest in the enhancement of the typical seasonal cycle of sea-level pressure in the Northern Hemisphere relative to that of the present day, and enhancement and equatorward shift of the Aleutian and Icelandic lows in northern winter. Over the period 15-8 kyr BP, within the current boreal forest zone, herbaceous tundra was replaced by shrub tundra, and subsequently by evergreen or deciduous forest, but there is uncertainty in the location, timing, and exact nature of these transitions. The specific location of the relatively small area of the Asian boreal forest-tundra transition can have an impact on regional climate, primarily in the net shortwave radiation component of the surface energy budget in spring, and in the cloudiness, net shortwave radiation, and turbulent heat fluxes in summer. These changes also have an impact on global climate. Our results suggest that the additional northern heating leads to a reduced equator-pole heat transport in the Northern Hemisphere which then influences heat and momentum transport in the Southern Hemisphere. | ['bartlein', 'lynch', 'river'] | ","['bartlein', 'lynch', 'river']",3
21,"Atmosperic deposition of mercury in Norway: temporal and spatial trends | Data from a study of Hg in the terrestrial environment in Norway are presented. Analyses of moss samples and comparison with wet deposition data indicate that dry deposition of gaseous Hg is important at northern latitudes. The Hg content of the humus layer of natural soils shows only moderate regional differences, but is to some extent dependent on atmospheric deposition from long-range transport and local point sources. Peat cores from ombrotrophic bogs provide information about recent and pre-industrial levels of Hg deposition, the ratio between levels varying from less than 2 to almost 10 depending on the location. Surprisingly high levels in surface peat in the northern part of the country support the conclusion indicated from moss analysis concerning the significance of dry deposition. ¬© 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers. | ['anderssor', 'steinnes'] | ","['anderssor', 'steinnes']",1
22,"Bayesian Reconstruction of Past Land Cover From Pollen Data: Model Robustness and Sensitivity to Auxiliary Variables | Realistic depictions of past land cover are needed to investigate prehistoric environmental changes, effects of anthropogenic deforestation, and long-term land cover-climate feedbacks. Observation-based reconstructions of past land cover are rare, and commonly used model-based reconstructions exhibit considerable differences. Recently, Pirzamanbein et al. (2018, , Spatial Statistics, 24:14-31) developed a statistical interpolation method that produces spatially complete reconstructions of past land cover from pollen assemblage. These reconstructions incorporate a number of auxiliary data sets raising questions regarding the method's sensitivity to different auxiliary data sets. Here the sensitivity of the method is examined by performing spatial reconstructions for northern Europe during three time periods (1900 CE, 1725 CE, and 4000 BCE). The auxiliary data sets considered include the most commonly utilized sources of past land cover data-for example, estimates produced by a dynamic vegetation model and anthropogenic land cover change models. Five different auxiliary data sets were considered, including different climate data driving the dynamic vegetation model and different anthropogenic land cover change models. The resulting reconstructions were evaluated using cross validation for all the time periods. For the recent time period, 1900 CE, the different land cover reconstructions were also compared against a present day forest map. The validation confirms that the statistical model provides a robust spatial interpolation tool with low sensitivity to differences in auxiliary data and high capacity to capture information in the pollen-based proxy data. Further auxiliary data with high spatial detail improves model performance for areas with complex topography or few observations. | ['lindstrom', 'pirzamanbein', 'poska'] | ","['lindstrom', 'pirzamanbein', 'poska']",1
23,"Biomorphic analysis as a part of soil morphological investigations | Biomorphic analysis is the microscopic investigation of plant tissue, detritus, phytoliths, pollen and other remains of biota for the reconstruction of ancient pedogenic conditions and the evolution of soils. Each biomorph is associated with certain types of landscape, and provides information on conditions of soil development and on landscape evolution. Every stage of soil development forms its own biomorph profile, and profiles of different stages can be distinguished. They indicate the main vegetation changes during the Holocene. Human impacts such as grazing, tillage and tree felling also exert a considerable influence on the qualitative and quantitative distribution of biomorphs through the profile. As examples, samples were studied from soil profiles representing different climatic subzones of the Russian Plain. The results show that biomorphic analyses can provide information that is otherwise unobtainable and can elucidate some controversial questions of soil genesis and cultural changes. | ['golyeva'] | ",['golyeva'],1
24,"Biophysical feedbacks between the Pleistocene megafauna extinction and climate: The first human-induced global warming? | A large increase in Betula during a narrow 1000 year window, similar to 13,800 years before present (YBP) in Alaska and Yukon corresponded in time with the extinction of mammoths and the arrival of humans. Pollen data indicate the increase in Betula during this time was widespread across Siberia and Beringia. We hypothesize that Betula increased due to a combination of a warming climate and reduced herbivory following the extinction of the Pleistocene mega herbivores. The rapid increase in Betula modified land surface albedo which climate-model simulations indicate would cause an average net warming of similar to 0.021 degrees C per percent increase in high latitude (53-73 degrees N) Betula cover. We hypothesize that the extinction of mammoths increased Betula cover, which would have warmed Siberia and Beringia by on average 0.2 degrees C, but regionally by up to 1 degrees C. If humans were partially responsible for the extinction of the mammoths, then human influences on global climate predate the origin of agriculture. Citation: Doughty, C. E., A. Wolf, and C. B.

25,"Buried soil organic inclusions in non-sorted circles fields in northern Sweden: Age and Paleoclimatic context | Although burial of surface organic soil horizons into deeper mineral soil layers helps drive the long-term buildup of carbon in arctic soils, when and why buried horizons formed as result of cryoturbation in northern Sweden remain unclear. In this study, we used C-14 and Pb-210 dating to assess when organic matter was buried within non-sorted circles fields near Abisko in northern Sweden. In addition, we used aerial photos from 1959 and 2008 to detect eventual trends in cryogenic activities during this period. We found that organic matter from former organic horizons (stratigraphically intact or partly fragmented) corresponds to three major periods: 0-100 A. D., 900-1250 A. D., and 1650-1950 A. D. The latter two periods were indicated by several dated samples, while the extent of the oldest period is more uncertainty (indicated by only one sample). The aerial photos suggest a net overgrowth by shrub vegetation of previously exposed mineral soil surfaces since 1959. This overgrowth trend was seen in most of the studied fields (92 out of 137 analyzed fields), indicating that the cryogenic activity has mainly decreased in studied non-sorted circles fields since the 1950s. This latter interpretation is also supported by the absence of buried organic layers formed during the last decades. We suggest that the organic matter was buried during the transition from longer cold periods to warmer conditions. We believe these climatic shifts could have triggered regional scale burial of soil organic matter and thus affected how these soils sequestered carbon. Citation: Becher, M., C. Olid, and J.

26,"Calibrated pollen accumulation rates as a basis for quantitative tree biomass reconstructions | Recent investigations show that the pollen accumulation rate (PAR) of the common tree taxa is directly related to the biomass and, by inference, to the population size of the taxa around the study site. Fossil PAR records preserved in lakes provide therefore a potential proxy for quantitative biomass and population reconstructions. We use the high-resolution PAR records obtained from two accurately dated lake sediment cores in Finland to generate quantitative Holocene biomass records for Pinus, Picea and Betula, the most common tree taxa of the European Boreal forest. PAR values were calibrated to biomass values by comparing the modern PAR values with the modern biomass values and assuming a linear relationship between the past PAR and biomass values. The obtained PAR and biomass values and trends are remarkably coherent between the two records. Pinus has a stable Holocene biomass size and its modern biomass, about 20 t/ha corresponds with the natural Pinus biomass in the study regions. In contrast, Picea immigrated from the East during the mid Holocene, had a maximum biomass, 50-60 t/ha, at 3500-1000 cal. yr BP, and declined strongly during the last 1500-1000 years as a result of increased human activity and related rise of fire frequency. Thus, the modern Picea biomass in the study regions, about 22 t/ha, is only 35-40% of the natural Picea biomass. The results of this pilot study demonstrate the potential of the calibrated PAR data in quantitative biomass and population reconstructions. Such reconstructions can provide fresh insights into the structure of past plant communities and, when combined with records reflecting palaeoclimates, natural disturbances, and human activity, can help to disentangle the long-term importance of different enviromental drivers to changes in plants populations and ecosystems. | ['alenius', 'giesecke', 'miller', 'muukkonen', 'ojala', 'seppa'] | ","['alenius', 'giesecke', 'miller', 'muukkonen', 'ojala', 'seppa']",3
27,"Calibration of radiocarbon ages and the interpretation of paleoenvironmental records | Calibration of the radiocarbon timescale of paleoecological records is essential if they are to be explained correctly in terms of their governing ecological or climatological controls, The differences between calendar ages and radiocarbon ages that arise from variations in C-14 production through time can distort the chronologies of individual records and the interpretations based on them, Misleading impressions of synchrony or diachrony of events among multiple records can result, and estimates of the apparent duration of episodes and rates of sedimentation and local population changes can be biased, Displays of the temporal patterns of migration or extinction may also be affected, Spurious correlations may arise between records with radio carbon-controlled chronologies and time series of potential controls that are expressed on a calendar time scale, Support for particular explanations of features in a paleoecological record may vary depending on whether radiocarbon ages are calibrated or not, This situation is illustrated using the eastern Beringian Populus subzone as an example. When the radiocarbon ages that control the timing of the Populus subzone are calibrated, the contemporaneous decrease in ice volume and increase in summer insolation are implicated as the ultimate controls of the occurrence of the subzone.

28,"Holocene carbon accumulation of fen peatlands in boreal western Canada: A complex ecosystem response to climate variation and disturbance | Understanding the long-term ecological dynamics of northern peatlands is essential for assessment of the possible responses and feedbacks of these carbon-rich ecosystems to climate change and natural disturbance. I used high-resolution macrofossil and lithological analyses of a fen peatland in western Canada to infer the Holocene developmental history of the peatland, to document the temporal pattern of long-term peat accumulation, and to investigate ecosystems responses to climate changes in terms of species composition and carbon accumulation. The peatland has been dominated by sedges and brown mosses during its 10,000-year history, despite interruption by tephra deposition. Peat accumulation rates vary by more than an order of magnitude and decline from 5500 to 1300 cal BP, resulting in a convex depth-age curve, which contrasts with the carbon accumulation patterns documented for oceanic peatlands. The synthesis of regional data from continental western Canada indicates that fens tend to accumulate more carbon than bogs of the same ages. These data suggest that the carbon sink potential of northern peatlands has varied dramatically in the past, so estimates of the present and projected carbon sink strengths of these peatlands need to take this temporal variation into consideration. Widespread slowdown of peat accumulation over the last 4000 years may have resulted from climate cooling in northern latitudes after the Holocene insolation maximum. The findings indicate that long-term peatland dynamics are modified by many local and regional factors and that gradual environmental change may be capable of triggering abrupt shifts and jumps in ecosystem states. | ['yu'] | ",['yu'],3
29,"Carbon accumulation in a permafrost polygon peatland: steady long-term rates in spite of shifts between dry and wet conditions | Ice-wedge polygon peatlands contain a substantial part of the carbon stored in permafrost soils. However, little is known about their long-term carbon accumulation rates (CAR) in relation to shifts in vegetation and climate. We collected four peat profiles from one single polygon in NE Yakutia and cut them into contiguous 0.5cm slices. Pollen density interpolation between AMS C-14 dated levels provided the time span contained in each of the sample slices, which - in combination with the volumetric carbon content - allowed for the reconstruction of CAR over decadal and centennial timescales. Vegetation representing dry palaeo-ridges and wet depressions was reconstructed with detailed micro- and macrofossil analysis. We found repeated shifts between wet and dry conditions during the past millennium. Dry ridges with associated permafrost growth originated during phases of (relatively) warm summer temperature and collapsed during relatively cold phases, illustrating the important role of vegetation and peat as intermediaries between ambient air temperature and the permafrost. The average long-term CAR across the four profiles was 10.6 +/- 5.5g Cm(-2)yr(-1). Time-weighted mean CAR did not differ significantly between wet depression and dry ridge/hummock phases (10.6 +/- 5.2g Cm(-2)yr(-1) and 10.3 +/- 5.7g Cm(-2)yr(-1), respectively). Although we observed increased CAR in relation to warm shifts, we also found changes in the opposite direction and the highest CAR actually occurred during the Little Ice Age. In fact, CAR rather seems to be governed by strong internal feedback mechanisms and has roughly remained stable on centennial time scales. The absence of significant differences in CAR between dry ridge and wet depression phases suggests that recent warming and associated expansion of shrubs will not affect long-term rates of carbon burial in ice-wedge polygon peatlands. | ['couwenberg', 'gao'] | ","['couwenberg', 'gao']",3
30,"Holocene carbon dynamics of boreal and subarctic peatlands from Quebec, Canada | Peatlands constitute major sinks of organic carbon (C) and play a key role in the global C cycle. Here, we present a synthesis of peat records from six ecoclimatic regions in Quebec, Canada, in order to quantify Holocene patterns of C accumulation and relationships with contemporary climate data. Average long-term apparent rates of C accumulation (LORCA) were calculated for 21 peat cores and range from 10 to 70 g C/m(2)/yr with a mean of 26.1 (standard error of mean (SEM) = 3.6) g C/m(2)/yr, which is slightly higher than the mean value for northern peatlands as a whole (Loisel et al., 2014). We found that regional climate has been a major factor controlling long-term peatland C accumulation and that site-specific factors may explain some variability between sites. Our data show that LORCA tend to decrease with latitude. The lowest LORCA are found in the northernmost peatlands located at the boreal forest/forest-tundra ecotone, whereas the highest values are recorded in the peatlands along the St. Lawrence Estuary, characterized by the highest mean summer temperature, number of growing degree-days above 0 degrees C and mean annual precipitation. Temporal variations in Holocene C accumulations rates were synthesized for 16 peat cores, which show high values during the mid-Holocene (6000-4000 cal. yr BP) followed by a decline during the Neoglacial cooling, especially between 2000 and 1200 cal. yr BP. Our study contributes to a better understanding of sensitivity of peatland C balance to climate change in a poorly documented part of the circumboreal region. | ['asnong', 'beaulieu', 'audy', 'garneau', 'lamarre', 'magnan', 'van', 'bellen'] | ","['asnong', 'beaulieu', 'audy', 'garneau', 'lamarre', 'magnan', 'van', 'bellen']",4
31,"Carbon sequestration, vegetation dynamics and soil development in the Boreal Transition ecoregion of Saskatchewan during the Holocene | Boreal forest soils have the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon by accumulating charcoal from fire. Some suggest that sequestration rates could be large enough to account for some of the missing sink in the global CO2 budget, but further data on soil charcoal pools are necessary to adequately develop boreal carbon budgets under a changing climate and fire regime. The primary objective of this study was to determine the amount of charred wood in surface mineral soil horizons (Ah) of the Boreal Transition of Saskatchewan, a fire-prone grassland forest ecotone region of western Canada. A second objective was to use the charcoal data to infer vegetation dynamics and the development of these Ah horizons as a function of parent material type, i.e. glacio-fluvial, glacio-lacustrine and glacial till. The latter objective served to provide information in regards to future vegetation shifts and ecosystem C budgets of Boreal Plain ecosystems under climatic warming. The carbon fraction measured as charcoal is an important component of organic matter in Ah horizons of Chemozemic soils in Saskatchewan and differs from the classical model of humus fractions in Chemozems which suggests that it is a system created from microbial degradation of root litter only. The carbon sequestered as charcoal within the whole ecoregion was estimated at 36.1 Tg, which is the lower limit of the global annual rate of charcoal accumulation in terrestrial environments estimated from experimental fires. Charcoal pools were consistently lower in the fluvial soils relative to the lacustrine and till soils. We suggest a model where dry conditions and low water availability prevailing under the coarser fluvial soils during the Holocene favoured the dominance of low productivity herbaceous vegetation that led to a high ash to charcoal production ratio from fire and to the development of relatively thick Ah horizons through below ground additions of organic matter from root decay. We Propose that the more available water in lacustrine and till soils favoured the growth of trembling aspen which, through less frequent/intense fires relative to grasslands and incomplete burning of the woody material, led to high charcoal accumulation rates in soil. The development of thick Ah horizons in lacustrine soils likely occurred during a warm and dry period of the early Holocene (i.e. the hypsithermal) when herbaceous vegetation invaded forested land or during dry spells in the mid to late Holocene (e.g. the Medieval Warm Period) when opening of forest canopies occurred, thus augmenting light transmission to the forest floor and favouring the growth of herbaceous vegetation in the understory. Such events did not create deep Ah horizons in the tills soils as a consistent rock impediment near the surface limited the penetration of understory roots at greater depth. These results suggest that fluvial sites my be the first shifting to herbaceous vegetation in the future due to climatic warming, followed by till sites and then lacustrine sites.

32,"Arctic charr in Lake Myvatn: The centennial catch record in the light of recent stock estimates | In Lake Myvatn, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is economically the most important fish species. It is fast growing fish and its size at maturity is 35-50 cm at the age of 4 to 5 years. Catch statistics that are available for the whole 20th century show considerable long-term variation with the highest catch in the 1920s. The catches after 1970 are about 40% lower than the average from 1930-1969 and the annual catches for the last decade are the lowest. Stock size during the winter fishing season fluctuated considerably between years, with average annual fishing mortality of 83.9%. The Arctic charr population has been monitored annually since 1986, using standard series of gill nets of different mesh sizes. In 1988 one to three-year-old fish were heavily reduced in numbers during the summer months. There are indications of a similar event in 1997. In both years the charr changed its main diet from Cladocera and chironomid midges to three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and snails. At the same time its condition deteriorated. The catch in the monitoring fishery in Lake Myvatn correlates with the stock size in the beginning of the following winter fishing season deduced from Leslie's method and can give prospects for the fishery in the successive fishing season. An index of abundance of young charr also correlates with the number of chironomids and cladocerans and also with ducklings that feed on the same food as the charr. Large fluctuations in the Arctic charr population in Lake Myvatn seem to be related to changes in the main food species. The catch records available from Lake Myvatn can to a large extent be used as a measure of changes of the Arctic charr population in the lake for the past century. | ['gudbergsson'] | ",['gudbergsson'],2
33,"Chironomid response to environmental drivers during the Holocene in a shallow treeline lake in northwestern Fennoscandia | The significance of different environmental drivers for the chironomid compositional changes during the Holocene was assessed using partial redundancy analysis. These drivers included pollen-inferred mean July air temperature, vegetation cover as pollen percentages, diatom-inferred water pH and total organic carbon (TOC), and sediment properties as loss on iginition (LOI). Variance partitioning showed that on the Holocene timescale, chironomid assemblages were significantly responding to changes in Betula percentages. This is explained by the co-occurring response of chironomids to the Holocene climatic development, which has also been responsible for the development of vegetation in the catchment. However, during the very early Holocene period from 10 500 cal. yr BP to 8300 cal. yr BP chironomids were responding more directly to the changes in water quality, ie, pH. During the latter part of the Holocene, no environmental variable appeared to be significant in explaining the variation in chironomid assemblages. This may be due to the underestimation of the actual water TOC by the diatom-based TOC model. However, for the latter part of the Holocene, from 5000 cal. yr BP to the present, the importance of limnological changes attributed to the development of marginal mires on the midges is evident. Our study shows that factors other than climate may have had more direct influence on the chironomid abundances at certain time periods. Although these factors are probably indirectly connected to climate through catchment processes, more understanding of the catchment-mediated climate effects on lake ecology and chironomids in high latitudes is needed, in addition to careful site selection, in order to better understand the environmental reconstructions. | ['korhola', 'nyman', 'weckstrom'] | ","['korhola', 'nyman', 'weckstrom']",1
34,"A clash of plants: vegetation succession and its interaction with permafrost dynamics in the Arctic lowland tundra | A typical Arctic lowland site (Kytalyk natural reserve) in the Northeastern Siberia was explore to determine how vegetation is changing in this ecosystem, and how changes in the abiotic environment and vegetation succession interact. Based on field observations, it is assumed that the plant species composition of each vegetation patch at the study site changes continuously following cycles over time. To test this assumption, two multiple-year field experiments (Chokurdakh Scientific Tundra Station and northeast Siberian tundra, both in the Kytalyk Nature Reserve, Russia) were carried out. Results indicated a complete vegetation succession loop in the Arctic lowland tundra, which is closely related to the dynamics of the permafrost. In this vegetation succession loop, four stages with distinctive vegetation types have been identified. Betula nana shrubs mainly dominate the well-drained elevated areas. In a field experiment, removal of B. nana shrubs resulted in abrupt permafrost degradation, rapid soil moisture increase and invasion of the grass species Arctagrostis latifolia. After a short time period, when small ponds or drainage had developed, this fast-responding grass species is replaced by Eriophorum sedges. In the subsequent stage the Sphagnum mosses invade the sedge vegetation. The new Sphagnum moss carpets not only suppress the growth of Eriophorum sedges, but also create moist but unsaturated substrates that appear to be appropriate for the germination of B. nana seeds. These conditions provide new opportunities for B. nana shrubs to establish. The reproduction mode of B. nana at the study site has been studied using molecular tools (microsatellites), as it may explain how existing B. nana patches developed and how shrub vegetation may expand in the future. The conventional point of view is that sexual reproduction of perennial plants in the Arctic tundra, like B. nana, is rare due to the pressure of the harsh environment. However, the results of our molecular study indicates otherwise. While vegetative reproduction of B. nana is common, sexual reproduction of B. nana is more prevalent. Seed dispersal of B. nana between different patches at the study site is not hampered by the short between-patch distances, but vegetative reproduction of B. nana appeared to be restricted to 1-2 m distances from the parent plants. The influences of the climate on B. nana shrubs were further investigated using the dendrochronological analyses. The radial growth of B. nana is positively correlated with early summer temperature, while relatively high summer precipitation during the warm years also stimulates the growth of B. nana. Moreover, sufficient summer precipitation facilitates the establishment of B. nana seedlings. Since sexual reproduction is prevalent at the site, it is suggested that the present B. nana shrubs established simultaneously, during periods with suitable climate conditions. Along with the vegetation succession cycles, permafrost underlying the vegetation experiences clear degradation-recovery cycles. A close interaction was detected between vegetation shifts and permafrost dynamics. While abrupt permafrost degradation drove a quick vegetation shift from the B. nana dominated stage to the water-logged Eriophorum sedge dominate stage, the changes of vegetation cover affect the stability of the permafrost as well. The removal of B. nana shrub cover triggered rapid permafrost degradation, while the development of Sphagnum moss carpets, which have a high isolation capacity, reduced permafrost temperature, facilitating permafrost recovery. Vegetation composition in the Arctic tundra not only influences permafrost stability, but also affects the methane emission of the site. Eriophorum sedges are able to transport methane from deep soil to the air via their aerenchyma tissues, leading to high methane fluxes. In contrast, the Sphagnum mosses significantly suppress the methane emission, since endophytic CH<sub>4</sub>-oxidizing bacteria are widespread inside the aerobic unsaturated Sphagnum carpets. | ['li'] | ",['li'],3
35,"Climate and abrupt vegetation change in Northern Europe since the last deglaciation | A long-standing question in palaeoecology has been to determine the importance of climate driving vegetation change since the last deglaciation. Here, we investigate the local-to-regional dynamics of vegetation change during the Lateglacial and the Holocene in Northern Europe. We extracted sites from the European Pollen Database and used the squared-chord distance (SCD) dissimilarity metric to identify time periods of high pollen assemblage turnover representing periods of abrupt vegetation change. In addition, a set of generalized additive mixed models were applied to investigate the underlying dynamics of two periods of higher rates of turnover: the Younger Dryas-early Holocene transition (YD-EH; 11.6-9.0kyr) and early-middle Holocene (EMH; 9.0-6.0kyr). Results revealed a high frequency of turnover events between 12.75-11.5, 10.75-11, 10.25-10, 7.75-7.25, 3.25-3.0 and 1.75-.25kyr. Furthermore, there was a strong linear relationship between pollen assemblage turnover and large directional temperature changes during the abrupt climate changes of the Lateglacial-early Holocene transition. In contrast, patterns of turnover during the Holocene were generally site-specific and during the EMH, we found evidence that the vegetation response was non-linear and highly variable across and between regions. Our results have implications for understanding the relationship between threshold dynamics and the amplitude of an extrinsic forcing. Across the Lateglacial-early Holocene boundary, the rate and magnitude of temperature change were large enough to override any site-specific thresholds, resulting in large assemblage turnovers. In contrast, during the Holocene, the vegetation response was mediated by intrinsic factors, which resulted in varying turnover rates between regions. The next research challenge is to attempt to determine whether it is possible to appreciate the velocity and rate of change that is necessary to result in these different responses and whether this rate is the same across biomes. | ['macias', 'fauria', 'seddon', 'willis'] | ","['macias', 'fauria', 'seddon', 'willis']",0
36,"Climate controls on the Holocene development of a subarctic lake in northern Fennoscandia | Climate exerts strong control over the functioning of northern freshwater ecosystems, yet their resilience and responses to climate forcing may vary. We examined postglacial development patterns in subarctic Lake Varddoaijavri to discern the impact of direct climate controls, catchment influence, and ontogenic processes on the ecological functioning of the lake over the Holocene. Subfossil diatom assemblages together with the elemental and stable isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) composition of sediment organic matter were used to examine climate-induced changes in the structure of the phototrophic community and transport of terrestrial organic matter from the catchment. Stable isotopic composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) of subfossil Cladocera (Crustacea) was further used to assess how the changes were reflected higher up the food web. The diatom assemblages and sediment geochemistry closely mirrored the established climate patterns of the Holocene, confirming the strong climate coupling evidenced by earlier studies from lakes across the circumpolar Arctic. Our record indicates overarching influence of moisture fluctuations, superimposing the impact of light limitation by terrestrial organic carbon and temperature-driven alterations to lake physical regimes, which have been emphasized by recent research. The millennial changes in humidity were reflected as shifting dominance between planktonic and benthic diatom life forms, related to changes in the depth of the water column, vertical mixing patterns, and underwater light conditions. Despite the marked regime shifts at the base of the food web, zooplankton carbon utilization was little changed over the Holocene, likely attributable to selective feeding strategies. Overall, our results propose that the projected increases in precipitation in high-latitude regions may have marked impact on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities in shallow subarctic lakes.

37,"Past climate-driven range shifts and population genetic diversity in arctic plants | AimHigh intra-specific genetic diversity is necessary for species adaptation to novel environments under climate change, but species tracking suitable conditions are losing alleles through successive founder events during range shift. Here, we investigated the relationship between range shift since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and extant population genetic diversity across multiple plant species to understand variability in species responses.LocationThe circumpolar Arctic and northern temperate alpine ranges.MethodsWe estimated the climatic niches of 30 cold-adapted plant species using range maps coupled with species distribution models and hindcasted species suitable areas to reconstructions of the mid-Holocene and LGM climates. We computed the species-specific migration distances from the species glacial refugia to their current distribution and correlated distances to extant genetic diversity in 1295 populations. Differential responses among species were related to life-history traits.ResultsWe found a negative association between inferred migration distances from refugia and genetic diversities in 25 species, but only 11 had statistically significant negative slopes. The relationships between inferred distance and population genetic diversity were steeper for insect-pollinated species than wind-pollinated species, but the difference among pollination system was marginally independent from phylogenetic autocorrelation.Main conclusionThe relationships between inferred migration distances and genetic diversities in 11 species, independent from current isolation, indicate that past range shifts were associated with a genetic bottleneck effect with an average of 21% loss of genetic diversity per 1000km(-1). In contrast, the absence of relationship in many species also indicates that the response is species specific and may be modulated by plant pollination strategies or result from more complex historical contingencies than those modelled here. | ['alsos', 'alvarez', 'brochmann', 'damgaard', 'descombes', 'ehrich', 'eidesen', 'guisan', 'luoto', 'normand', 'pellissier', 'schoenswetter', 'tribsch', 'vittoz', 'westergaard', 'wisz', 'zimmermann'] | ","['alsos', 'alvarez', 'brochmann', 'damgaard', 'descombes', 'ehrich', 'eidesen', 'guisan', 'luoto', 'normand', 'pellissier', 'schoenswetter', 'tribsch', 'vittoz', 'westergaard', 'wisz', 'zimmermann']",1

39,"Climate change and evolutionary adaptations at species' range margins | During recent climate warming, many insect species have shifted their ranges to higher latitudes and altitudes. These expansions mirror those that occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum when species expanded from their ice age refugia. Postglacial range expansions have resulted in clines in genetic diversity across present-day distributions, with a reduction in genetic diversity observed in a wide range of insect taxa as one moves from the historical distribution core to the current range margin. Evolutionary increases in dispersal at expanding range boundaries are commonly observed in virtually all insects that have been studied, suggesting a positive feedback between range expansion and the evolution of traits that accelerate range expansion. The ubiquity of this phenomenon suggests that it is likely to be an important determinant of range changes. A better understanding of the extent and speed of adaptation will be crucial to the responses of biodiversity and ecosystems to climate change. ¬© 2011 by Annual Reviews.

40,"Climate-fire interactions during the Holocene: a test of the utility of charcoal morphotypes in a sediment core from the boreal region of north-western Ontario (Canada) | Charcoal accumulation rates and fire-return intervals were calculated from total charcoal and charcoal morphotypes over the Holocene, from a well-dated sediment core from Lake 239 located in north-western Ontario, and compared with previously published independent climate reconstructions. Both total and morphotype analysis show a two-to-three fold increase in accumulation rates in the early-to-mid Holocene (range: 1 to 6 pieces cm(-2) year(-1)) compared with the early and late Holocene (range: 0 to 2 pieces cm(-2) year(-1)). Fire-return intervals and fire frequencies calculated during these periods, based on peak analysis, showed very different trends. The fire-return interval based on Type M charcoal, a morphotype associated with primary charcoal deposition, was high during the early and late Holocene, and low from similar to 7500 to 4000 cal year BP, with high inferred fire frequency during the warm mid-Holocene (similar to 12.5 fires per 1000 years), compared with, 5 fires per 1000 years over the rest of the Holocene, whereas fire-return interval and fire frequency based on total charcoal did not show patterns consistent with climate. These results suggest that a two-to three-fold increase in fire frequency would not be unexpected in the future under a predicted warmer climate. | ['cumming', 'moo'] | ","['cumming', 'moo']",1
41,"Climate impacts on human settlement and agricultural activities in northern Norway revealed through sediment biogeochemistry | Disentangling the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the environment is a major challenge in paleoenvironmental research. Here, we used fecal sterols and other biogeochemical compounds in lake sediments from northern Norway to identify both natural and anthropogenic signals of environmental change during the late Holocene. The area was first occupied by humans and their grazing animals at similar to 2,250 +/- 75 calendar years before 1950 AD (calendar years before present). The arrival of humans is indicated by an abrupt increase in coprostanol (and its epimer epicoprostanol) in the sediments and an associated increase in 5 beta-stigmastanol (and 5 beta-epistigmastanol), which resulted from human and animal feces washing into the lake. Human settlement was accompanied by an abrupt increase in landscape fires (indicated by the rise in pyrolytic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and a decline in woodland (registered by a change in n-alkane chain lengths from leaf waxes), accelerating a process that began earlier in the Holocene. Human activity and associated landscape changes in the region over the last two millennia were mainly driven by summer temperatures, as indicated by independent tree-ring reconstructions, although there were periods when socioeconomic factors played an equally important role. In this study, fecal sterols in lake sediments have been used to provide a record of human occupancy through time. This approach may be useful in many archeological studies, both to confirm the presence of humans and grazing animals, and to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural factors that have influenced the environment in the past. | ['balascio', 'bradley', 'danjou', 'finkelstein'] | ","['balascio', 'bradley', 'danjou', 'finkelstein']",0
42,"Climate-induced changes in carbon flows across the plant-consumer interface in a small subarctic lake | Reconstructions of past food web dynamics are necessary for better understanding long-term impacts of climate change on subarctic lakes. We studied elemental and stable isotopic composition of sedimentary organic matter, photosynthetic pigments and carbon stable isotopic composition of Daphnia (Cladocera; Crustacea) resting eggs (delta C-13(Clado)) in a sediment record from a small subarctic lake. We examined how regional climate and landscape changes over the last 5800 years affected the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon transfer to zooplankton. Overall, delta C-13(Clado) values were well in line with the range of theoretical values of aquatic primary producers, confirming that zooplankton consumers in subarctic lakes, even in the long-term perspective, are mainly fuelled by autochthonous primary production. Results also revealed greater incorporations of benthic algae into zooplankton biomass in periods that had a warmer and drier climate and clearer water, whereas a colder and wetter climate and lower water transparency induced higher contributions of planktonic algae to Daphnia biomass. This study thus emphasizes long-term influence of terrestrial-aquatic linkages and in-lake processes on the functioning of subarctic lake food webs. | ['belle', 'freiberg', 'goedkoop', 'nilsson', 'tonno', 'vrede'] | ","['belle', 'freiberg', 'goedkoop', 'nilsson', 'tonno', 'vrede']",4

44,"Climate change and the molecular ecology of arctic marine mammals | Key to predicting likely consequences of future climate change for Arctic marine mammals is developing a detailed understanding of how these species use their environment today and how they were affected by past climate-induced environmental change. Genetic analyses are uniquely placed to address these types of questions. Molecular genetic approaches are being used to determine distribution and migration patterns, dispersal and breeding behavior, population structure and abundance over time, and the effects of past and present climate change in Arctic marine mammals. A review of published studies revealed that population subdivision, dispersal, and gene flow in Arctic marine mammals was shaped primarily by evolutionary history, geography, sea ice, and philopatry to predictable, seasonally available resources. A meta-analysis of data from 38 study units across seven species found significant relationships between neutral genetic diversity and population size and climate region, revealing that small, isolated subarctic populations tend to harbor lower diversity than larger Arctic populations. A few small populations had substantially lower diversity than others. By contrast, other small populations retain substantial neutral diversity despite extensive population declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The evolutionary and contemporary perspectives gained from these studies can be used to model the consequences of different climate projections for individual behavior and population structure and ultimately individual fitness and population viability. Future research should focus on: (1) the use of ancient-DNA techniques to directly reconstruct population histories through the analysis of historical and prehistorical material, (2) the use of genomic technologies to identify, map, and survey genes that directly influence fitness, (3) long-term studies to monitor populations and investigate evolution in contemporary time, (4) further Arctic-wide, multispecies analyses, preferably across different taxa and trophic levels, and (5) the use of genetic parameters in population and species risk analyses. | ['ocorry', 'crowe'] | ","['ocorry', 'crowe']",3
45,"Climate change and Ontario's Provincial Parks: towards an adaptation strategy | This report assesses the implications of climate change for Ontario's system of provincial parks. A broad range of climate change impacts (e.g., changes in ecosystem composition, structure, and function as well as increased forest fire severity) were identified as potentially significant for Ontario Parks' policy, planning, and management frameworks. While the literature review and the models described in this report identify a number of potential impacts resulting from climate change (e.g., changes in biome climate envelope representation, increased forest fire severity, and the loss of polar bear [Ursus maritimus] habitat from Polar Bear Provincial Park), significant knowledge gaps remain in many areas. As such, the results presented in this study should be taken as indicative, not predictive, of the magnitude of impact climate change may have on Ontario's provincial parks. A historical climate regime was completed for a representative sample of eight provincial parks to illustrate variability and trends in mean annual temperature (MAT) and total annual precipitation (TAP) during the 20th and early 21st centuries. While statistical significance varied, MAT increased at all stations over their respective historical records compared to the 1961 to 1990 period. TAP increased in all but Lake Superior Provincial Park over the historical record when compared to the 1961 to 1990 period. Using some of the climate change scenarios sponsored by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), changes in temperature and precipitation are projected for the sample of parks for the periods 2020 to 2029, 2050 to 2059, and 2080 to 2089. Based on the outputs from the scenarios, most parks are projected to experience MAT increases of 1.8 to 3.2 degrees C in the 2020s, 1.8 to 7.0 degrees C in the 2050s, and 2.5 degrees C to 10.0 degrees C in the 2080s. The greatest increases in temperature are projected for the more northern parks, including Tidewater Provincial Park in the northeast and Wabakimi Provincial Park in the northwest. The majority of scenarios project an increase in TAP. There is, however, considerable variability in the projected changes to the minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation between the parks analysed, times considered (e.g., 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s), and the scenarios evaluated. Using global circulation model (GCM)-driven global vegetation models (GVMs), this analysis projected changes to the climate envelope of biome types (i.e., climatic requirements) in Ontario provincial parks. Results indicate that 64 to 93% of Ontario's provincial parks could experience a change in biome climate envelope during the 21st century. The climate envelopes of more northerly biomes are projected to retreat further north and the taiga biome climate envelope is projected to shift north beyond the political boundary of Ontario altogether. The climate envelopes for the more southerly biomes, including temperate and savanna forest climate envelopes, are projected to advance north as well. Finally, using a Canadian General Circulation Model (CGCM2)-driven fire model, we present historical and projected changes in fire severity (the potential for increased forest fire intensity and a longer forest fire season) for Ontario's system of provincial parks for the 2050s (doubled-CO<sub>2</sub>) and 2090s (tripled-CO<sub>2</sub>) compared to the baseline period of 1980 to 1989. In general, results showed declines in the low forest fire severity rankings and a significant increase in high and extreme forest fire severity rankings by the 2050s and 2090s. For example, during the 1980 to 1989 baseline period, only 3% of Ontario's provincial parks were classified within the extreme fire severity ranking. By the 2050s, this percentage increases to 10% and by the 2090s, extreme fire severity is projected to expand into nearly a quarter (21%) of all provincial parks.

46,"Climate change during the past 1000 years: a high-temporal-resolution multiproxy record from a mire in northern Finland | We present a record of peatland development in relation to climate changes and human activities from the Palomaa mire, a remote site in northern Finland. We used fine-resolution and continuous sampling to analyse several proxies including pollen (for vegetation on and around the mire), testate amoebae (TA; for mire-wetness changes), oxygen and carbon isotopes from Sphagnum cellulose (18O and 13C; for humidity and temperature changes), peat-accumulation rates and peat-colour changes. In spite of an excellent accumulation model (30 14C dates and estimated standard deviation of sample ages <1 year in the most recent part), the potential to determine causeeffect (or leadlag) relationships between environmental changes and biotic responses is limited by proxy-specific incorporation processes below the actively growing Sphagnum surface. Nevertheless, what emerges is that mire development was closely related to water-table changes rather than to summer temperature and that water-table decreases were associated with increasing peat-accumulation rates and more abundant mire vegetation. A rapid fen-to-bog transition occurred within a few years around AD 1960 when the water table decreased beyond the historical minimum, supporting the notion that mires can rapidly shift into bogs in response to allogenic factors.

The resulting atmospheric CO2 reconstruction documents the onset of a gradual increase c. 5000 years before present indicating that the carbon cycle has not been in steady state over this time. Stable carbon isotope (delta(13)C) measurements of the subfossil leaves constrain the interpretation of the inferred changes in the operation of the global carbon cycle.

48,"Combining limnology and paleolimnology to assess the influence of climate change on two lakes in Southern Greenland | We aim at understanding the influence of climate change on the functioning of two freshwater lakes in South Greenland by combining limnological and paleolimnological methods. The results offer a means of testing the potential use of subfossil chironomid for paleoclimate reconstruction. First, the current ecological status of Lake Igaliku and Lake 95 has been assessed by the combined use of a biotic index and delta N-15 analysis of chironomid larvae. The current ecological state of Lake 95, as a remote lake exempt from local human activities, remains pristine. In contrast, Lake Igaliku exhibits a worrying ecological state characterized by the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, a loss of littoral biodiversity, and alterations of its trophic functioning. A paleolimnological approach, combining subfossil chironomid and geochemical analysis, was applied to reconstruct the ecological trajectories of the lakes over the last 150 years. Redundancy analysis performed on chironomid assemblages shows that the two systems are partially driven by climate variability, and underscoring the strong potential of chironomid remains for paleoclimatic reconstruction. However, local farming activities in the catchment area of Lake Igaliku have strongly impacted its ecological state since the late 1980s, masking the actual effects of the current global warming. In conclusions in southern Greenland, lakes in pristine conditions may be excellent candidates for the past climate reconstructions based on subfossil chironomids. | ['belle', 'bichet', 'massa', 'mavon', 'millet', 'rius'] | ","['belle', 'bichet', 'massa', 'mavon', 'millet', 'rius']",0
49,"Combining paleo-data and modern exclosure experiments to assess the impact of megafauna extinctions on woody vegetation | Until recently in Earth history, very large herbivores (mammoths, ground sloths, diprotodons, and many others) occurred in most of the World's terrestrial ecosystems, but the majority have gone extinct as part of the late-Quaternary extinctions. How has this large-scale removal of large herbivores affected landscape structure and ecosystem functioning? In this review, we combine paleo-data with information from modern exclosure experiments to assess the impact of large herbivores (and their disappearance) on woody species, landscape structure, and ecosystem functions. In modern landscapes characterized by intense herbivory, woody plants can persist by defending themselves or by association with defended species, can persist by growing in places that are physically inaccessible to herbivores, or can persist where high predator activity limits foraging by herbivores. At the landscape scale, different herbivore densities and assemblages may result in dynamic gradients in woody cover. The late-Quaternary extinctions were natural experiments in large-herbivore removal; the paleoecological record shows evidence of widespread changes in community composition and ecosystem structure and function, consistent with modern exclosure experiments. We propose a conceptual framework that describes the impact of large herbivores on woody plant abundance mediated by herbivore diversity and density, predicting that herbivore suppression of woody plants is strongest where herbivore diversity is high. We conclude that the decline of large herbivores induces major alterations in landscape structure and ecosystem functions. | ['asner', 'bakker', 'gill', 'johnson', 'sandom', 'svenning', 'vera'] | ","['asner', 'bakker', 'gill', 'johnson', 'sandom', 'svenning', 'vera']",3
50,"Community Assembly and Climate Mismatch in Late Quaternary Eastern North American Pollen Assemblages | Plant community response to climate change ranges from synchronous tracking to strong mismatch. Explaining this variation in climate change response is critical for accurate global change modeling. Here we quantify how closely assemblages track changes in climate (match/mismatch) and how broadly climate niches are spread within assemblages (narrow/broad ecological tolerance, or ""filtering"") using data for the past 21,000 years for 531 eastern North American fossil pollen assemblages. Although climate matching has been strong over the last 21 millennia, mismatch increased in 30% of assemblages during the rapid climate shifts between 14.5 and 10 ka. Assemblage matching rebounded toward the present day in 10%-20% of assemblages. Climate-assemblage mismatch was greater in tree-dominated and high-latitude assemblages, consistent with persisting populations, slower dispersal rates, and glacial retreat. In contrast, climate matching was greater for assemblages comprising taxa with higher median seed mass. More than half of the assemblages were climatically filtered at any given time, with peak filtering occurring at 8.5 ka for nearly 80% of assemblages. Thus, vegetation assemblages have highly variable rates of climate mismatch and filtering over millennial scales. These climate responses can be partially predicted by species' traits and life histories. These findings help constrain predictions for plant community response to contemporary climate change. | ['blois', 'blonder', 'knight', 'macias', 'fauria', 'ordonez', 'svenning'] | ","['blois', 'blonder', 'knight', 'macias', 'fauria', 'ordonez', 'svenning']",4

To test the hypotheses that recent climate warming selects for species of smaller size within communities and a decrease in the average size of species within populations, we quantified the size of individual diatom valves from 10 depths in a sediment core covering the last similar to 200 years from a pristine subarctic lake. Over the last similar to 200 years, changes in the relative abundance of species of different average size and changes in the average valve size of populations of species contribute equally to the changes in community size structure, but are often opposite in sign, compensating for one another and moderating temporal changes in community size structure. In the surface sediments that correspond to the recent decades when air temperatures have warmed, the mean size of valves in the diatom community has significantly decreased due to an increase in the proportion of smaller-sized planktonic diatom species. | ['finkel', 'irwin', 'kerrigan'] | ","['finkel', 'irwin', 'kerrigan']",0
52,"Comparative methods for reconstructing fire histories at the stand scale using charcoal records in peat and mineral soils | Analysis and C-14 dating of charcoal fragments >= 2 mm buried in mineral soils make it possible to obtain a standscale portrait of Holocene fires that occurred in well-drained, fire-prone environments, as well as changes in forest stand composition over time, based on botanical identification of charcoals. However, it is not always possible to reconstruct all fire events, due to disturbances that altered soil stratigraphy. In order to evaluate the efficacy of this approach, we conducted a comparative analysis with a proximal environment that presents an a priori continuous stratigraphy of charcoal fragments. For two sites in the coniferous boreal forest of eastern North America, the charcoal record of a forest soil was compared with that of an adjacent peatland margin situated at a distance of 20 m. For both types of sedimentary environments, a similar fire history was reconstructed for a large part of the Holocene. The greatest differences were for the early Holocene period, for which a smaller number of fires was detected in the forest soil compared to the peatland soil. Retracing the oldest fires using mineral soils in a fire prone environment is more difficult, due to charcoal decay that results from repeated fire events. However, forest soils reveal a relatively accurate fire history for subsequent millennia if the number of charcoals dated is sufficiently large. Any accurate reconstruction of the fire history of proximal peatland environments is strongly dependent on continuous stratigraphic units of peat and charcoal. Indeed, the age of charcoal fragments in peat may be different from that of the sedimentary layer in which they are buried due to allogenic disturbances like erosion events caused by deep burning of the organic horizon and other mass wasting events. Despite the large number of C-14 dates it requires, analysis of soil macrocharcoal yields a realistic picture of the fire history at the stand scale. The concurrent analysis of macrocharcoal from adjacent peatland deposits may be used as a complement to more accurately record the oldest fire events. | ['couillard', 'lavoie', 'payette', 'tremblay'] | ","['couillard', 'lavoie', 'payette', 'tremblay']",1
53,"Comparison of marine and terrestrial Holocene climatic reconstructions from northeastern North America | Quantitative climate reconstructions based on marine dinocysts and terrestrial pollen sequences are consistent through the Holocene in northeastern North America. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicates a large-scale climate signal in the dinocysts and pollen. The combined and separate analyses of marine and nearby terrestrial pollen sequences from Hudson Bay, Labrador and the St Lawrence estuary differentiate tundra, boreal forest and deciduous forest assemblages in time and space. These analyses indicate that the marine pollen record reflects vegetation changes of the regional terrestrial environment and allows direct correlations between the marine and terrestrial stratigraphies. Sea-surface temperatures estimated from dinocysts and terrestrial air temperatures from pollen using the method of modem analogs show that the three regions had differing climate histories associated with their location with respect to deglaciation and air mass boundaries. High frequency climatic changes reconstructed for the St Lawrence estuary and Gulf, and a cooling reconstructed for the period prior to 8000 yr BP, are less reliable due to the larger values of the dissimilarity coefficients. Prior to 6000 yr BP, cool temperatures reconstructed along the Labrador margins, both in the marine and terrestrial environments, are in agreement with climate simulations indicating the persistence of an anticyclone over the Quebec-Labrador ice sheet. In both Labrador and northwestern Quebec, a late-Holocene cooling affects sites in the forest-tundra, but is not evident in Boreal forest sites, suggesting movements in the mean position of the polar front. | ['gajewski', 'richard', 'sawada', 'de', 'vernal'] | ","['gajewski', 'richard', 'sawada', 'de', 'vernal']",1
54,"Comparison of quantitative Holocene temperature reconstructions using multiple proxies from a northern boreal lake | Four biotic proxies (plant macrofossils, pollen, chironomids and diatoms) are employed to quantitatively reconstruct variations in mean July air temperatures (T-jul) at Lake Loitsana (northern Finland) during the Holocene. The aim is to evaluate the robustness and biases in these temperature reconstructions and to compare the timing of highest T-jul in the individual reconstructions. The reconstructed T-jul values are evaluated in relation to local-scale/site-specific processes associated with the Holocene lake development at Loitsana as these factors have been shown to significantly influence the fossil assemblages found in the Lake Loitsana sediments. While pollen-based temperatures follow the classical trend of gradually increasing early-Holocene T-jul with a mid-Holocene maximum, the aquatic/wetland assemblages reconstruct higher-than-present T-jul already during the early Holocene, that is, at the peak of summer insolation. The relatively low early-Holocene July temperatures recorded by the pollen are the result of site-specific factors possibly combined with a delayed response of the terrestrial ecosystem compared with the aquatic ecosystem. Our study shows that all reconstructions are influenced at least to some extent by local factors.

The HYDE dataset was reconstructed by Goldewijk and his colleagues at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in Netherland, covering the past 12 000 years. The KK dataset was reconstructed by Kaplan and his colleagues, the Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Research Group at the Institute of Environmental Engineering in Switzerland, covering the past 8000 years. The Pongratz dataset was reconstructed by Pongratz and her colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, covering AD 800-1992. The results show that the reconstructed datasets are quite different from each other due to the different methods used. The three datasets all allocated the historical ALCC according to human population density. The main reason causing the differences among the three datasets lies on the different relationships between population density and land use used in each reconstructed dataset. The KK dataset is better than the other two datasets for two important reasons. First, it used the nonlinear relationship between population density and land use, while the other two used the linear relationship. Second, Kaplan and his colleagues adopted the technological development and intensification parameters and considered the wood harvesting and the long-term fallow area resulted from shifting cultivation, which were neglected in the reconstructions of the other two datasets. Therefore, the KK dataset is more suitable as one of the anthropogenic forcing fields for climate simulation over the past two millennia that is recently concerned by two projects, the National Basic Research Program and the Strategic and Special Frontier Project of Science and Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. | ['kaplan', 'liu', 'min', 'wang', 'wang', 'yan'] | ","['kaplan', 'liu', 'min', 'wang', 'wang', 'yan']",3
56,"Comparison of soil derived tetraether membrane lipid distributions and plant-wax delta D compositions for reconstruction of Canadian Arctic temperatures | Polar amplification of climate warming has received much attention as these rapidly rising temperatures have the potential to alter ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycles. In particular carbon preserved in Arctic tundra soil and permafrost may be especially vulnerable resulting in carbon cycle perturbations providing an additional positive feedback to climate change. Reliable methods for reconstructing past temperature changes in polar regions have been established from ice cores and marine sediments; however techniques for the continental terrestrial environments are lacking, but are imperative to examine polar amplification of climate warming. Here we compare two molecular methods for reconstructing continental annual mean air temperature (MAT) for the Canadian Arctic based on the distribution of soil bacterial-derived glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids (MBT-CBT proxy) and the hydrogen isotopic composition (delta D) of plant wax-derived n-alkanes. These two proxies were applied to both modern soil and paleosols collected from the Yukon Territory, Canada, to evaluate both the accuracy of the reconstructed absolute temperatures as well as the relative change in temperature between the Last Glacial and the Holocene. Branched GDGT-based estimates using the recently revised MBT'-CBT calibration are overall higher by ca. 6 degrees C compared to the original calibration. MAT estimates for modern soils based on the original MBT-CBT calibration are comparable with those based on the 60 of extracted C-29 n-alkanes and instrumental data, however produced a 6 degrees C higher temperature signal for the glacial paleosols. Therefore, branched GDGT based temperature reconstructions for glacial soils in the high Arctic may represent the higher temperatures at the time of soil formation when bacterial activity was optimal whereas delta D of C-29 n-alkane plant lipids appear to integrate an average annual signal. When used in tandem, these geochemical proxies may provide a more comprehensive method for reconstructing Arctic paleoclimate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

57,"Consistency of the Iksinskoe bog dynamics with extreme Holocene climate events C3 - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science | This research is devoted to the response of the southern taiga oligotrophic Iksinskoe bog to extreme Holocene climatic events. Based on data of preliminary geological exploration and 14 C-dated cores-analogues of this bog, a spatio-temporal model of paludification and vegetation succession from 11 paleosurface chrono-slices is created. It has been shown that the global dry cooling events of about 8200, 5900, 4900, and 2800 cal yr BP influenced the bog dynamics. Their direct impact is through the formation of a long-term thawing seasonal frost and permafrost water pressure as well as palsa. Their indirect impact is through a permafrost degradation and a subsequent warming. The cooling of 2800 cal yr BP had the maximum effect due to a drying and cryogenic peat accumulation stopping over a large area of the bog. During the subsequent warming of 2450 and 1900 cal yr BP there was a significant increase in the water content of the bog surface, and a phased oligotrophization of paleophytocenoses took place. The direct and indirect impacts of extremely dry Holocene cooling caused active paludificating, catastrophic changes in the paleophytocenoses, high water content of the surface, and reduced the depth of peat deposits of the Iksinskoe bog. ¬© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. | ['krutikov', 'polishchuk', 'preis'] | ","['krutikov', 'polishchuk', 'preis']",3
58,"Continuously missing outer rings in woody plants at their distributional margins | Woody plants growing in seasonal climates normally form one growth ring each year. However, under severe stress conditions they may not complete annual wood production all the way down to the root collar resulting in continuously missing outer rings at lower stem sections (CMORs). Here we test whether CMORs occur at different distributional margins of woody plant species, where stress levels are expected to be high. We tested 13 species (202 individuals) of trees and shrubs growing at elevational and latitudinal shrub- and tree-lines, under conditions that are normally associated with a reduction of radial growth such as drought, cold or nutrient deficiency. Samples were collected from Alaska, north western Russia, Central Europe, Scandinavia and south eastern Spain. Annual radial growth was measured along several disks or cores of each individual applying the serial sectioning technique. Individuals of nine species showed CMORs. The proportion of individuals with CMORs within a sampled species and site ranged from 0% to 80%. The number of CMORs within an individual increased with decreasing sampling height on the stem. Significant correlations existed between the amount of CMORs and (i) cambial age, (ii) stem length, (iii) stem proportion/length below peat surface, and (iv) herbivore-caused defoliation intensity depending on the species and sampling location. Our results suggest that CMORs can be associated with a cambium that may be inactive, yet functional, for up to 18 years. We conclude that CMORs can occur in a wide variety of species, growth forms and biomes, suggesting a general strategy of woody plant growth. To avoid miss-dating in dendrochronological studies, we further recommend the use of the serial sectioning technique for woody plants growing in unfavorable environments, above all, when sample size is limited and when no established chronology for cross-dating is available. | ['babst', 'bogaert', 'hahne', 'hallinger', 'juday', 'kyncl', 'luis', 'novak', 'vollm', 'wilmking'] | ","['babst', 'bogaert', 'hahne', 'hallinger', 'juday', 'kyncl', 'luis', 'novak', 'vollm', 'wilmking']",4
59,"Controls of climate, catchment erosion and biological production on long-term community and functional changes of chironomids in High Arctic lakes (Svalbard) | Arctic freshwater basins are diversity hotspots and sentinels of climate change, but their long-term variability and the environmental variables controlling them are not well defined. We examined four available lake sediment sequences from High Arctic Svalbard for their subfossil Chironomidae communities, biodiversity and functional traits and assessed the influence of climatic and limnological variability on the long-term ecological dynamics. Our results indicated that collector-filterers had an important role in the oligotrophic sites, whereas collector-gatherers dominated the nutrient-enriched sites with significant bird guano inputs. In the oligotrophic sites, benthic production, taxon richness and taxonomic and functional diversity were highest during the early Holocene, when temperatures showed a rapid increase. An increase in subfossil abundance and diversity metrics was also found in recent samples of the oligotrophic sites, but not in the bird-impacted sites, where the trends were decreasing. When partitioning out the environmental forcing on chironomid communities, the influence of climate was significant in all the sites, whereas in-lake production (organic matter) was significant in two of the sites and catchment erosion (magnetic susceptibility) had only minor influence. The findings suggest that major changes in Arctic chironomid assemblages were driven by climate warming with increasing diversity in oligotrophic sites, but deteriorating ecological functions in environmentally stressed sites. We found that although taxonomic and functional diversity were always coupled, taxonomical and functional turnovers were coupled only in the oligotrophic sites suggesting that the ecological functions operated by chironomids in these low productivity sites may not be as resilient to future environmental change. | ['luoto', 'ojala'] | ","['luoto', 'ojala']",3
60,"From controversy to consensus: making the case for recent climate using lake sediments | We live in a constantly changing environment, yet tracking ecological change is often very difficult. Long-term monitoring data are frequently lacking and are especially sparse from Arctic ecosystems, where logistical difficulties limit most monitoring programs. Fortunately, lake and pond sediments contain important archives of past limno-logical communities that can be used to reconstruct environmental change. Here, we summarize some of the pale-olimnological studies that have documented recent climate warming in Arctic lakes and ponds. Several hypotheses have been evaluated to determine if warming, resulting in changes in ice cover and related variables (eg increased habitat availability), was the factor most strongly influencing recent diatom and other biotic changes. Striking and often unprecedented community changes were evident in post-1850 sediments, and could be linked to ecological shifts consistent with warming. Because future temperature increases are predicted to be greatly amplified in polar regions, the ecological integrity of these sensitive ecosystems will be further imperiled. | ['douglas', 'smol'] | ","['douglas', 'smol']",3
61,"Convergent catastrophes and the termination of the Arctic Norwegian Stone Age: A multi-proxy assessment of the demographic and adaptive responses of mid-Holocene collectors to biophysical forcing | Using multiple archeological and paleoenvironmental proxies, this paper makes the case for a climate-induced convergent catastrophe among the human population of terminal Stone Age Arctic Norway. We show that climatic changes correlate with the termination of the so-called Gressbakken phase (4200-3500 cal BP), and unpack the middle-range mechanisms linking the Gressbakken termination to contemporaneous changes in the biophysical environment. We show that what was a Holocene extreme, and likely volcanically-induced, climate deterioration around 3550 cal BP coincided with a population decline as reflected in the frequency of radiocarbon-dated archeological sites along with major changes in material culture and settlement pattern. Together, these proxies suggest a return to forms of social and economic organization based on lower population densities, higher residential mobility, and reduced locational investments. In establishing the middle-range ecological mechanics mediating these changes into archeologically observable patterns, the results indicate that the Gressbakken termination was the result of a particularly unstable climate period characterized by regional paludification, increased effective precipitation, forest decline, and likely impacts on reindeer populations and their migratory behavior, with drastic human implications. We argue for a convergent catastrophe-scenario in which a series of hardships between 4000 and 3500 cal BP exceeded the adaptive mitigation capabilities of the contemporaneous Arctic Norwegian population. Our study supports the notion that increased sedentism and locational investment actually increases vulnerability in the face of rapid biophysical change and contributes to the growing database of past human ecodynamics that speak to current socio-ecological concerns. | ['jorgensen', 'riede'] | ","['jorgensen', 'riede']",0
62,"Critical levels of atmospheric pollution: Criteria and concepts for operational modelling of mercury in forest and lake ecosystems | Mercury (Hg) is regarded as a major environmental concern in many regions, traditionally because of high concentrations in freshwater fish, and now also because of potential toxic effects on soil microflora. The predominant source of Hg in most watersheds is atmospheric deposition, which has increased 2- to &gt;20-fold over the past centuries. A promising approach for supporting current European efforts to limit transboundary air pollution is the development of emission-exposure-effect relationships, with the aim of determining the critical level of atmospheric pollution (CLAP, cf. critical load) causing harm or concern in sensitive elements of the environment. This requires a quantification of slow ecosystem dynamics from short-term collections of data. Aiming at an operational tool for assessing the past and future metal contamination of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we present a simple and flexible modelling concept, including ways of minimizing requirements for computation and data collection, focusing on the exposure of biota in forest soils and lakes to Hg. Issues related to the complexity of Hg biogeochemistry are addressed by (1) a model design that allows independent validation of each model unit with readily available data, (2) a process- and scale-independent model formulation based on concentration ratios and transfer factors without requiring loads and mass balance, and (3) an equilibration concept that accounts for relevant dynamics in ecosystems without long-term data collection or advanced calculations. Based on data accumulated in Sweden over the past decades, we present a model to determine the CLAP-Hg from standardized values of region- or site-specific synoptic concentrations in four key matrices of boreal watersheds: precipitation (atmospheric source), large lacustrine fish (aquatic receptor and vector), organic soil layers (terrestrial receptor proxy and temporary reservoir), as well as new and old lake sediments (archives of response dynamics). Key dynamics in watersheds are accounted for by quantifying current states of equilibration in both soils and lakes based on comparison of contamination factors in sediment cores. Future steady-state concentrations in soils and fish in single watersheds or entire regions are then determined by corresponding projection of survey data. A regional-scale application to southern Sweden suggests that the response of environmental Hg levels to changes in atmospheric Hg pollution is delayed by centuries and initially not proportional among receptors (atmosphere‚â´soils‚â†sediments&gt;fish; clearwater lakes‚â´humic lakes). This has implications for the interpretation of common survey data as well as for the implementation of pollution control strategies. Near Hg emission sources, the pollution of organic soils and clearwater lakes deserves attention. Critical receptors, however, even in remote areas, are humic waters, in which biotic Hg levels are naturally high, most likely to increase further, and at high long-term risk of exceeding the current levels of concern: ‚â§0.5 mg (kg fw)-1 in freshwater fish, and 0.5 mg (kg dw)-1 in soil organic matter. If environmental Hg concentrations are to be reduced and kept below these critical limits, virtually no man-made atmospheric Hg emissions can be permitted. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

63,"Declines in littoral species richness across both spatial and temporal nutrient gradients: a palaeolimnological study of two taxonomic groups | 1. Using a palaeolimnological approach in shallow lakes, we quantified the species richness responses of diatoms and Cladocera to phosphorus enrichment. We also examined differences in species richness responses between littoral and pelagic assemblages of our focal communities. To address both spatial and temporal relationships, our study includes an analysis of both surface sediments from 40 lakes and of a lake sediment record spanning c. 120 years. The objective of our study was to determine whether similar species richness patterns occurred across trophic levels, as well as along spatial and temporal gradients. 2. We found that both diatom and Cladocera species richness estimates significantly declined with increasing phosphorus across space and through time. When the assemblages were subdivided according to known habitat preferences, littoral biodiversity maintained a negative trend, whereas pelagic species richness tended to show no relationship with phosphorus. 3. Negative productivitydiversity patterns have been observed across almost all palaeolimnological studies that span large productivity gradients. This congruence in patterns is most likely due to the similarity in data collection methods and in focal communities studied. The contrasting responses between littoral and pelagic assemblages may be explained by the differences in physical habitat and the pool of taxa in each of these environments. Consistent with the literature, we found statistical support for the idea that littoral diversity declines could be explained by an interaction between macrophytes and nutrients along strong trophic gradients. The general lack of a diversity response in our pelagic assemblages could be attributable to the limited pool of subfossil taxa. The response of the pelagic diatom could also be related to their broad range of nutrient tolerances. 4. The observed negative response of species richness to phosphorus enrichment, particularly in the littoral assemblages, has implications for ecosystems functioning because communities with reduced biodiversity often are less resilient to anthropogenic change. | ['gregory', 'eaves', 'velghe', 'vermaire'] | ","['gregory', 'eaves', 'velghe', 'vermaire']",3
64,"A dendroecological method to evaluate past caribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) activity | Records of population changes of caribou come from various sources (historical accounts, hunting and trading statistics, herd surveys) that are typically incomplete and discontinuous in time and space. Here we propose a new method for the evaluation of past caribou activity using tree-ring records from boreal and subarctic conifer stands. The age-frequency distributions of trampling scars produced by caribou hooves on surficial roots and low branches of erect and stunted conifers are used as an index of the passage of caribou through stands during the snow-free period. To verify if changes in the age structure of trampling scars correspond to changes in abundance of caribou movement, we analyzed factors influencing production and loss of scars at two lichen-woodland sites in northeastern Quebec-Labrador (Canada). The detailed analysis of trampling scars in the first site indicates that the capacity of conifers to produce scars is maintained under a regime of repeated caribou traffic; scars were formed at new positions along the exposed roots and scars continued to be produced at a same position in a minimum time of one growing season, even after 15 years of caribou traffic. The influence of repeated caribou trampling on loss of scars was measured by comparing the age structure of scars of three vegetation groups (based on caribou trail network) with different intensities of use. The similarity of the age structures of the three groups showed that scar loss due to trampling was hardly detectable, which indicated that scar loss was low in comparison to the number of scars produced, even in the most used trails. Sampling of trampling scars during two successive years at the second site showed that the stability of the age structure of scars was not affected by moderate caribou traffic. Our results, therefore, indicate that most of the information deduced from the age structures of trampling scars comes from changes in caribou activity. The method opens the possibility of assessing caribou activity in time (several decades) and space over large areas of the boreal forest and the forest-tundra biomes. | ['morneau', 'payette'] | ","['morneau', 'payette']",3

The problems related to the combination of dendrogeomorphological information with other geochronological evidence and with other continuous time series are discussed.

66,"Detecting local-scale fire episodes on pollen slides | Assessment of the impacts of future climate change on the boreal forest and forest-tundra biomes relies on a clear understanding of their past dynamics. Fire history information recorded in lake and peat sediments can be retrieved by counting charcoal particles on pollen slides, although it is still debated whether this is reliable at the scale of the watershed (i.e. local scale). Knowing that proportionately larger charcoal particles tend to settle closer to the fire compared to smaller particles, a new method of quantifying microscopic charcoal on pollen slides is presented, taking into account the size distribution of the charcoal fragments in each sample of a sediment core (the CSD method). The late-Holocene fire history of the surroundings of a small subarctic lake was reconstructed using this method and compared with results from four other methods (macroscopic charcoal counts, charcoal concentration, charcoal:pollen ratio, charcoal:Picea ratio). All methods were tested for accuracy by comparison with the fire history of the watershed reconstructed by dendrochronology and radiocarbon-dated soil charcoal. Only the CSD method allowed separation of local-scale fire episodes from background noise attributable to long-distance dispersal. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

67,"Determinants of species abundance in the Quaternary vertebrate fossil record | Species abundance data are of vital importance in paleontology, but fossil accumulations invariably represent a biased subset of original source communities. Efforts to quantify taphonomic biases are typically prevented by a lack of independent data on the ecological composition of prehistoric faunas. However, analysis of the continental Holocene record can provide a rare opportunity for independent calibration of fossil abundance patterns. We analyzed a comprehensive data set available for the Holocene avifauna of Sweden to investigate the relationship between species abundance in the recent fossil and zooarchaeological records and in prehistoric source communities, and to characterize the importance of different ecological factors in determining terrestrial vertebrate fossil abundances. The number of assemblages in which species occurred was compared with modern-day species abundance, annual residence, body mass, and ecological realm. Modern-day abundance is only one of several significant predictors of fossil abundance; the strongest predictor is body mass, and Holocene species abundance can be interpreted as a measure of species abundance in source communities for a given size class only. Our study represents one of the only direct attempts to quantify species abundance biases between fossil faunas and source communities, and has general applicability for a wide range of terrestrial vertebrate faunas. | ['blackburn', 'turvey'] | ","['blackburn', 'turvey']",0
68,"Determining seasonality of mussel collection from an early historic Inuit site, Labrador, Canada: Comparing thin-sections with high-resolution stable oxygen isotope analysis | Stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18) analysis of mussels (Mytilus sp.) from a 16th to mid-18th century Inuit site in southern Labrador, Canada, indicates multiple seasons of shellfish collection, and by proxy, multiple seasons of site occupation. High-resolution delta O-18 sampling of shell permits a precise season of mussel collection since the temperature and freshwater signal of the local water is retained in the shell. Live-collected specimens of Mytilus sp. obtained from Labrador, were analyzed for stable oxygen isotopes and for growth patterns. These data were used to interpret results from the archaeological shells. Growth pattern analysis was conducted to test the relationship between delta O-18 values, growth lines and shell colour. Of the two approaches, high-resolution delta O-18 sampling proved to be more reliable for determining seasonality, and showed that the Inuit at Schooner Cove harvested mussels primarily during the spring months, with some harvesting evident in the winter and autumn. | ['burchell', 'cannon', 'hallmann', 'schone', 'stopp'] | ","['burchell', 'cannon', 'hallmann', 'schone', 'stopp']",3
69,"Developing a modern pollen-climate calibration data set for Norway | Modern pollen-climate data sets consisting of modern pollen assemblages and modern climate data (mean July temperature and mean annual precipitation) have been developed for Norway based on 191 lakes and 321 lakes. The original 191-lake data set was designed to optimize the distribution of the lakes sampled along the mean July temperature gradient, thereby fulfilling one of the most critical assumptions of weighted-averaging regression and calibration and its relative, weighted-averaging partial least-squares regression. A further 130 surface samples of comparable taphonomy, taxonomic detail and analyst became available as a result of other projects. These 130 samples, all from new lakes, were added to the 191-lake data set to create the 321-lake data set. The collection and construction of these data sets are outlined. Numerical analyses involving generalized linear modelling, constrained ordination techniques, weighted-averaging partial least-squares regression, and two different cross-validation procedures are used to asses the effects of increasing the size of the calibration data set from 191 to 321 lakes. The two data sets are used to reconstruct mean July temperature and mean annual precipitation for a Holocene site in northwest Norway and a Lateglacial site in west-central Norway. Overall, little is to be gained by increasing the modern data set beyond about 200 lakes in terms of modern model performance statistics, but the down-core reconstructions show less between-sample variability and are thus potentially more plausible and realistic when based on the 321-lake data set. | ['birks', 'bjune', 'odland', 'peglar'] | ","['birks', 'bjune', 'odland', 'peglar']",2

The slope consisted of a low-elevation rockwall and a rockwall-derived debris veneer overlying a sandy till deposit reworked by gelifluction. The sedimentological and stratigraphical data along with radiocarbon dating and dendroecological data indicated that: (1) the period around 5050 BP corresponded to the initial establishment of the forest cover probably after paraglacial rockfall activity following deglaciation; (2) it was followed by a period of stability until c. 3200-3000 BP when gelifluction occurred; (3) the period between c. 3000 BP and 900 BP was one of relative stability; until (4) a series of fires after 900 BP initiated a period of destabilization by mass movements and surficial weathering processes; (5) local permafrost formed during the last few centuries, especially under the forest fringe where Sphagnum peat developed.

71,"Holocene development and permafrost history in sub-arctic peatlands in Tavvavuoma, northern Sweden | Under changing climatic conditions permafrost peatlands can play an important role in the global carbon budget through permafrost carbon feedbacks and shifts in carbon assimilation. To better predict future dynamics in these ecosystems an increased understanding of their Holocene carbon and permafrost history is needed. In Tavvavuoma, northern Sweden, we have performed detailed analyses of vegetation succession and geochemical properties at six permafrost peatland sites. Peatland initiation took place around 10000 to 9600cal. a BP, soon after retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, and the peatlands have remained permafrost-free fens throughout most of the Holocene. At the four sites that showed a continuous accumulation record during the late Holocene radiocarbon dating of the shift from wet fen to dry bog vegetation, characteristic of the present permafrost peatland surface, suggests that permafrost developed at around 600-100cal. a BP. At the other two sites peat accumulation was halted during the late Holocene, possibly due to abrasion, making it more difficult to imply the timing of permafrost aggradation. However also at these sites there are no indications of permafrost inception prior to the Little Ice Age. The mean long-term Holocene carbon accumulation rate at all six sites was 12.3 +/- 2.4 gC m(-2) a(-1) (+/- SD), and the mean soil organic carbon storage was 114 +/- 27kg m(-2). | ['hempel', 'kessler', 'preskienis', 'sannel'] | ","['hempel', 'kessler', 'preskienis', 'sannel']",3
72,"Development of a raised bog over 9000 years in Atlantic Canada | The chronostratigraphy of a coastal bog was studied in order to distinguish the roles of autogenic and allogenic factors in peatland development. Well-dated stratigraphical sequences from a peat cliff were used. The peatland shows three main vegetation phases: rich fen, poor fen and bog. Peat formation started around 9500 yr BP and the first expansion phase of rich fen occurred between 8550 and 7400 yr BP. The rich fen gradually changed to a poor fen through autogenic processes between 7620 and 5500 yr BP. It then became a bog in two major development phases, possibly in response to climate change, around 5250 yr BP (central part) and 2800 yr BP (margins). Expansion resumed after 5500 yr BP and terminated shortly after 2500 yr BP when the peatland had filled the basin. Although autogenic succession is the dominant process by which the peatland has evolved, climatic variability has also affected peat expansion and vegetation change. The influence of fire was very limited but topography played a major role in peat expansion. One major find is that climate change can trigger simultaneous but various responses in local vegetation, depending upon its position on the bog surface. | ['begin', 'robichaud'] | ","['begin', 'robichaud']",3
73,"Development and refinement of proxy-climate indicators from peats | Peat, especially from acidic mires (bogs), is a natural archive of past environmental change. Reconstructions of past climate from bogs commenced in the 19th Century through examination of visible peat stratigraphy, and later formed the basis for a postglacial climatic scheme widely used in Northwest Europe. Nevertheless, misconceptions as to how bogs grow led to a 50-year lacuna in peat-climate study, before the concept of 'cyclic regeneration' in bogs was refuted. In recent decades, research using proxy-climate indicators from bogs has burgeoned. A range of proxies for past hydrological change has been developed, as well as use of pollen, bog oaks and pines and other data to reconstruct past temperatures. Most of this proxy-climate research has been carried out in Northern Europe, but peat-based research in parts of Asia and North America has increased, particularly during the last decade, while research has also been conducted in Australia, New Zealand and South America. This paper reviews developments in proxy-climate reconstructions from peatlands; chronicles use of a range of palaeo-proxies such as visible peat stratigraphy, plant macrofossils, peat humification, testate amoebae and non-pollen palynomorphs: and explains the use of wiggle-match radiocarbon dating and relationship to climate shifts. It details other techniques being used increasingly, such as biomarkers, stable-isotopes, inorganic geochemistry and estimation of dust flux: and points to new proxies under development. Although explicit protocols have been developed recently for research on ombrotrophic mires, it must be recognised that not all proxies and techniques have universal applicability, owing to differences in species assemblages, mire formation, topographic controls, and geochemical characteristics.

74,"Diatom and chrysophyte algal response to long-term PCB contamination from a point-source in Northern Labrador, Canada | The long-term response of diatom and chrysophyte communities to local PCB contamination was examined in an impacted and reference lake in northern Labrador. Beginning in the late 1950s, lake Saglek-2 (SK-2) received direct inputs of the contaminant in runoff, leaving a record of rising PCB concentrations in lake sediments. An examination of sediment samples spanning the past ‚àº 150 yr revealed chrysophyte and diatom assemblages characteristic of clear, slightly acidic, oligotrophic lakes, but surprisingly little change in either community was observed through time. The lack of response may be explained by several factors. For example, elevated PCB concentrations in lake sediments may not reflect bioavailable concentrations in lakewater. Therefore, realized concentrations may be too low to exhibit detrimental effects in phytoplankton communities. Our findings do, however, have important implications for studies of climate change in circumpolar regions. First, we provide additional evidence that climatic change has been minimal in northern Labrador, in contrast to changes observed in other Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Second, our findings support the notion that recent, marked changes in species composition observed in other Arctic lakes are the result of recent climate change and not caused by the contamination of lakes from the long-range transport of pollutants. | ['betts', 'piper', 'paterson', 'smol', 'zeeb'] | ","['betts', 'piper', 'paterson', 'smol', 'zeeb']",0
75,"Diatoms as indicators of environmental change in wetlands and peatlands | Diatoms serve as both engineers and barometers in wetlands and peatlands. They engineer shallow-water habitats through their productivity that controls water concentrations of gases and nutrients, supplies fixed carbon to the food web, forms habitat for other organisms, and contributes to sediment accretion and stabilization. They are barometers of the state of the environment through rapid population responses to fluctuations in the primary drivers of wetland structure and function, including water quantity and quality. These responses are reflected in changes in assemblage structure that can be measured over time and space and used to recount ecosystem evolution (i.e. hydroseral succession) as well as changes imposed by human activities. Because paleoecological studies offer the opportunity to put the latter (human impacts) in the context of the former (longer-term, natural changes), reading history from diatom records in wetland and peatland profiles is a powerful tool to guide ecosystem management on local to global scales. Given the alarming rates at which the world's wetlands are being lost and the challenges involved in understanding the ecological and societal repercussions of these losses, it would seem prudent that much effort should be put into developing tools for assessing the magnitude and the global implications of changes in our wetland ecosystems. This is particularly true for the expansive wetlands in rapidly developing tropical countries and in high-latitude wetlands subject to rapid climate change, where diatom-based assessment and paleoecological studies are still in their infancy but hold much promise. | ['gaiser', 'ruhland'] | ","['gaiser', 'ruhland']",0
76,"Diatom inferred acidity history of 32 lakes on the Kola Peninsula, Russia | The Kola Peninsula is characterised by vast environmental contrasts. Large areas are almost in pristine condition. However, mining and associated industrial activity generate one of the largest sources of heavy metal and sulphur emissions in the world and create 'technogenic wastelands' around smelters. Due to the lack of monitoring data, insufficient knowledge is available regarding the acidification history of lakes on the peninsula. In this study, palaeolimnological techniques were used to reveal the pre-industrial pH status of 32 small lakes in order to evaluate the role of human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Diatom-inferred pH reconstructions demonstrated that for 22 (68.75%) of the lakes, the pH was below 6.5 and in eight (25%) below 6.0 during the pre-industrial period; signs of recent acidification could be detected only in seven lakes of which five are located relatively close to current pollution sources. Furthermore, no substantial changes between the pre-industrial and modern species richness and composition were observed, indicating relatively stable environmental conditions. Most of the lakes seem to have undergone long-term acidification and are mainly affected by natural acidifying factors (e.g., vegetation, bedrock, climate, sea salt). The effect of anthropogenic emissions seems to be surprisingly geographically restricted and controlled mainly by the surrounding topography and prevailing winds. However, although many lakes seem to be in relatively pristine condition, only a significant reduction in heavy metal and sulphur emissions will prevent the lakes from acidifying in the future. | ['korhola', 'laing', 'macdonald', 'snyder', 'weckstrom'] | ","['korhola', 'laing', 'macdonald', 'snyder', 'weckstrom']",4

Currently, significant controversy still exists over the preservation of diatoms in peat. However, considerable evidence indicates that diatoms remain in good condition in minerotrophic peatlands, and they have been successfully used in paleoenvironmental studies in high-latitude regions and especially in Southern Europe. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

As the most probable cause of the observed effect, global warming has been proposed in some works. This paper presents the results of analysis of the recent increase in the total abundance of diatoms in Rabbvatnet Lake (Northern Norway). For analysis, paleolimnological, dendrochronological and meteorological regional data were used, as well as information on local pollution.

79,"C-13 discrimination by fossil leaves during the late-glacial climate oscillation 12-10 ka BP: Measurements and physiological controls | The late-glacial climatic oscillation, 12-10 ka BP, is characterised in ice core oxygen isotope profiles by a rapid and abrupt return to glacial climate. Recent work has shown that associated with this cooling was a drop in atmospheric CO2 concentration of ca. 50 ppm. In this paper, the impact of these environmental changes on C-13 discrimination is reported, based on measurements made on a continuous sequence of fossil Salix herbacea leaves from a single site. The plant responses were interpreted using an integrated model of stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation and intercellular CO2 concentration, influenced by external environmental factors. According to the model, temperature exerts a marked influence on C-13 discrimination by leaves and the pattern of C-13 changes recorded by the fossil leaves is consistent with other palaeotemperature curves for 12-10 ka BP, particularly the deuterium isotope record from Alaskan Salix woods, which generally reflects ocean temperatures. The gas exchange model correctly accounts for these changes and so permits the reconstruction of ancient rates of leaf CO2 uptake and loss of water vapour in response to the abrupt late-glacial changes in global climate and CO2. The approach provides the required physiological underpinning for extracting quantitative estimates of past temperatures and for contributing an ecophysiological explanation for changes in C-13 discrimination in the fossil record. | ['beerling'] | ",['beerling'],1
80,"Distal volcanic impacts on peatlands: palaeoecological evidence from Alaska | Despite the fact that volcanic ash (tephra) layers are found preserved in peat deposits around the world, comparatively little research has investigated the impacts of distal volcanic emissions on peatlands. This study investigates the impacts of several late-Holocene volcanic eruptions on five peatlands in southern Alaska using a palaeoecological approach. Testate amoebae analysis, peat humification analysis and a basic analysis of plant macrofossil components were applied across 11 tephra layers. Changes in macrofossil and testate amoebae assemblages occur across several of the tephra layers. The humification results were considered unreliable because of a methodological problem, a finding which may have implications for other studies using this technique. Redundancy analyses on testate amoebae data show statistically significant changes associated with two tephras. The most likely causes of the impacts are volcanic gases, acidic precipitation or tephra-derived leachates. The finding that some tephras are associated with impacts whereas others are not may relate to the season of the eruption or meteorological conditions at the time of ash fall. These results suggest the sensitivity of peatlands and peatland microbial communities to distal volcanic products and imply that changes in key palaeoclimatic proxies may be caused by a mechanism independent of climate change. Implications of the results for peat-based palaeoclimatic studies are discussed, as are possible directions for future research. (C)2008 Elsevier Ltd.

81,"Distinct microbial communities associated with buried soils in the siberian tundra | Cryoturbation, the burial of topsoil material into deeper soil horizons by repeated freeze-thaw events, is an important storage mechanism for soil organic matter (SOM) in permafrost-affected soils. Besides abiotic conditions, microbial community structure and the accessibility of SOM to the decomposer community are hypothesized to control SOM decomposition and thus have a crucial role in SOM accumulation in buried soils. We surveyed the microbial community structure in cryoturbated soils from nine soil profiles in the northeastern Siberian tundra using high-throughput sequencing and quantification of bacterial, archaeal and fungal marker genes. We found that bacterial abundances in buried topsoils were as high as in unburied topsoils. In contrast, fungal abundances decreased with depth and were significantly lower in buried than in unburied topsoils resulting in remarkably low fungal to bacterial ratios in buried topsoils. Fungal community profiling revealed an associated decrease in presumably ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. The abiotic conditions (low to subzero temperatures, anoxia) and the reduced abundance of fungi likely provide a niche for bacterial, facultative anaerobic decomposers of SOM such as members of the Actinobacteria, which were found in significantly higher relative abundances in buried than in unburied topsoils. Our study expands the knowledge on the microbial community structure in soils of Northern latitude permafrost regions, and attributes the delayed decomposition of SOM in buried soils to specific microbial taxa, and particularly to a decrease in abundance and activity of ECM fungi, and to the extent to which bacterial decomposers are able to act as their functional substitutes. ¬© 2014 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved. | ['b√°rta', 'gentsch', 'gilbert', 'gittel', 'guggenberger', 'hannisdal', 'kohoutov√°', 'lashchinskiy', 'maerz', 'mikutta', 'owen', 'richter', 'schleper', 'schnecker', 'shibistova', 'torsvik', 'urich', 'wild', 'ƒåapek', '≈†antr≈øƒçkov√°'] | ","['b√°rta', 'gentsch', 'gilbert', 'gittel', 'guggenberger', 'hannisdal', 'kohoutov√°', 'lashchinskiy', 'maerz', 'mikutta', 'owen', 'richter', 'schleper', 'schnecker', 'shibistova', 'torsvik', 'urich', 'wild', 'ƒåapek', '≈†antr≈øƒçkov√°']",0
82,"Disturbance and resilience of a Sphagnum peatland in western Russia (Western Dvina Lakeland) during the last 300 years: a multiproxy, high-resolution study | This paper presents the results of multiproxy research (pollen, charcoal, plant macrofossil and testate amoebae) on the biogenic deposits core from Gorodetsky Moch, an ombrotrophic peatland in western Russia (Western Dvina Lakeland). We reconstructed the impact of disturbance on peatland development in the last 300 years by using chronology of the records based on(14)C and(210)Pb data set. The multiproxy reconstruction was compared with changes in the land cover using historical maps and Corona images, which provides a unique spatial analysis of past ecological and land-use changes. We aimed to determine the effect of local disturbances (drainage) and land-use changes (landscape openness) on the development of the peatland during the last 300 years. Our study suggests that human activity had a crucial impact on the development of the peatland in the last centuries. The analysis of testate amoebae and plant macrofossils revealed a clear disturbed layer in the second half of the 20th century CE. Most probably, the drainage of the peatland triggered changes in the community of testate amoebae and plants, thereby causing a functional shift inSphagnumpeatland ecosystem. The hydrological stress and vegetation composition shift led to the collapse of mixotrophic testate amoebae. However, the peatland showed strong resilience and recovered toward the end of the 20th century CE and the beginning of the 21st century CE, despite the lower water table. Our study shows an example of the peatland ecosystem that experienced a considerable stress but finally sustained the former function. | ['arkhipova', 'kittel', 'lamentowicz', 'lokas', 'lucow', 'mazurkevich', 'mroz', 'obremska', 'slowinski', 'tjallingii'] | ","['arkhipova', 'kittel', 'lamentowicz', 'lokas', 'lucow', 'mazurkevich', 'mroz', 'obremska', 'slowinski', 'tjallingii']",3
83,"Are diversity trends in western Scandinavia influenced by post-glacial dispersal limitation? | QuestionsWhat are the latitudinal diversity patterns in Scandinavia over the last 8ka? Have they been consistent over time? What are the long-term diversity trends at different sites? Is there a consistent rate-of-change between sites?LocationThirty sites in Norway, two sites in north-west Sweden.MethodsPollen data from these 32 lakes. The sites lie within six of the vegetation zones of Moen (1998). The data are used to estimate pollen diversity using Hills effective species numbers N0, N1 and N2. Diversity relationships in time and along latitude are assessed using ANCOVA. Linear regression is used to investigate site-independent long-term trends. Patterns in the regression slopes are investigated between vegetation zones and along the latitudinal gradient.ResultsThe latitudinal pattern of decreasing diversity with increasing latitude existed over the last 8ka, although for the number of effectively common (N1) and abundant (N2) pollen taxa the relationship was slightly weaker between 8-6ka. Long-term trends show that diversity increases at most sites over time. However, the magnitude and rate-of-change vary between sites. Highest rate-of-change in N0 over time is observed in southern sites, although the spatial relationship of rate-of-change is not statistically significant.ConclusionsThe constant increase in diversity over time may reflect additional taxa arriving and changes in abundances. Most sites change in the same direction, but at different rates and magnitudes. There is no clear spatial pattern in rate-of-change, and the general patterns of increasing diversity over time are consistent with the hypothesis of post-glacial (Holocene) dispersal limitation. Drivers of these changes have not been rigorously investigated, but our results suggest that environmental and historical processes are not mutually exclusive. During the last 2-1ka BP diversity patterns have probably been increasingly affected by human land use. | ['birks', 'bjune', 'felde', 'grytnes', 'peglar'] | ","['birks', 'bjune', 'felde', 'grytnes', 'peglar']",0
84,"The early-Holocene spread of hazel (Corylus avellana L.) in Europe north and west of the Alps: an ecological hypothesis | The northward spread of hazel (Corylus avellana L.) from its glacial period refuges has been studied for over a century. North of the Alps the course of its pollen curve, in both relative and absolute pollen diagrams, differs from those of other early immigrant trees. There is no long 'tail' of low values before the marked 'rise' to high values. The hypothesis presented is that hazel was present as non-flowering trees beforehand, with full pollen production setting in after a stabilization and amelioration of the climate in the early Holocene. This view is based on a comprehensive survey of all the life history stages of hazel in relation to climatic and other factors, together with indications from radiocarbon dates of the 'rise' phenomenon, not of arbitrary pollen percentage values, for sites north of the Alps. The regional and altitudinal differences in C-14 dates, with due regard to the existence of C-14 plateaux, support the hypothesis, as do other independent estimates of the early-Holocene climate in northern Europe. The role of fluctuating seasonal air temperatures and precipitation is noted and the need to consider the ecological requirements of all stages of any plant species' life history is stressed. | ['tallantire'] | ",['tallantire'],4

During its short history, approximately 17838 500 L of oil was lost through spills and 9864 400 L was left in the line and storage tanks. Although some burning was done during salvage operations, most residual oil was drained onto the soil surface. Studies in alpine tundra indicate that this oil penetrated up to 60 cm in dry, coarse-textured soils and 8 cm in wet, clay-rich soils. Oil decomposition ranged from complete utilization of n-alkanes to selective metabolism of n-alkanes C12 to C19. Contaminated soils were drier than control soils. This, plus surface blackening and thinning or organic surface layers, resulted in subsurface warming. Floristic similarity coefficients comparing control sites and 27 crude-oil spills varied from 19 to 52. Plant cover was substantially lower on oil spills in only one community was floristic diversity greater on oil spills than on associated control sites.

87,"Ecological influences of Thule Inuit whalers on high Arctic pond ecosystems: a comparative paleolimnological study from Bathurst Island (Nunavut, Canada) | Until recently, major anthropogenic impacts on freshwater ecosystems were believed to be rare in North America prior to the period of European colonization. However, recent paleolimnological and archaeological data collected from the Canadian Arctic suggest that the whaling activities of Thule Inuit, who lived in small, nomadic communities, altered freshwater ecosystems centuries earlier. Using a comparative paleolimnological approach from two ponds situated adjacent to a former Thule winter settlement on south-eastern Bathurst Island (Nunavut, Arctic Canada), we record marked ecological changes in pond ecology due to eutrophication from the Thule's activities. The geography of our study site provided an interesting and rare opportunity for a comparative paleolimnological study of long-term Thule impacts on polar limnology, because our two study ponds (only similar to 50 m apart) were nearly identical in size and in geological and climatic settings, but differed markedly in the magnitude of Thule influence. Here, we recorded striking changes in diatom species assemblages, spectrally-inferred primary production, and nutrient geochemistry, indicating eutrophication in a small pond draining 18 Thule whale houses. Input of marine-derived nutrients from sea mammal carcasses used by the Thule for both sustenance and the construction of winter settlements, as well as other anthropogenic activities, coincided with a notable increase in the eutrophic diatom taxon Stephanodiscus minutulus, whereas no comparable changes were recorded in the nearby control pond for the duration of the sedimentary record. Although the diatom changes recorded in the affected site persisted after the period of Thule occupation, the most recent sediments and water chemistry suggest that the pond has largely recovered to near pre-impact conditions. | ['blais', 'douglas', 'hadley', 'mcghee', 'smol'] | ","['blais', 'douglas', 'hadley', 'mcghee', 'smol']",3
88,"Ecological and landscape considerations in forest management | A major challenge for the forestry sector is to adapt forest management to better sustain and promote biological diversity. In this thesis some aspects of such considerations on different spatial and temporal scales are studied and discussed. The dynamics of a natural forest landscape in Russia were studied by analysing peat cores. The forest landscape could roughly be divided into two types: one affected by fire on a regular basis and one type that can be regarded as a fire free refuge. There was evidence for a site related mosaic of forest dynamics in the landscape that had probably persisted in many thousands of years. The presence of such strongly contrasting disturbance regimes in the same landscape affects the distribution of plants, fungi and lichens. Another study showed that estimating the relative occurrence of charcoal bands in peat probes is a simple and practical method to assess past fire history in a landscape where surface signs are scarce or missing. Furthermore, vegetation groups with different relative fire intervals were distinguished. In a third study a different perspective was applied by studying how a management plan for a forestry estate needed to be adapted when using the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus as a target species. Around known leks (display areas) the management was adapted to suit the bird's needs. The set asides have to be increased with more than 100 ha., and the total cost for this management was estimated at 5% of the net present value. In the fourth study the usefulness of different regional classification systems as aids in planning for nature management in a landscape perspective were compared. The classifications showed a degree of similarity between the divisions of vegetation types and specific landscape. However, the regional classifications referred to all have some shortcomings. Firstly, an attempt is made to impose discrete boundaries on continuums of the earth's surface. Secondly, there is a need to complement the descriptions of the regions with details about dynamics. Different perspectives and approaches can be taken in ecological considerations. Depending on the conditions of a specific area, some are better suited than others. However, the complexity of the problem is so great that a precise scientific system for such considerations is unlikely to be constructed. Instead, regional and local experience, coupled with sound scientific knowledge, seems to be the best foundation for good ecosystem management. | ['jasinski'] | ",['jasinski'],1

This technique permits an evaluation of the probable climate at the time of deposition. The results indicate that the oldest deposits (at a depth of 47 m) correlate with the second period of the Zyryan Glaciation; samples at higher levels derive from the Kargin Interstadial and the subsequent Sartan glacial phase.

90,"Ecology of peatland testate amoebae in Svalbard and the development of transfer functions for reconstructing past water-table depth and pH | Peatlands are valuable archives of information about past environmental conditions and represent a globally important carbon store. Robust proxy methods are required to reconstruct past ecohydrological dynamics in high-latitude peatlands to improve our understanding of change in these carbon-rich ecosystems. The High Arctic peatlands in Svalbard are at the northern limit of current peatland distribution and have experienced rapidly rising temperatures of 0.81 degrees C per decade since 1958. We examine the ecology of peatland testate amoebae in surface vegetation samples from permafrost peatlands on Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago, and develop new transfer functions to reconstruct water-table depth (WTD) and pH that can be applied to understand past peatland ecosystem dynamics in response to climate change. These transfer functions are the first of their kind for peatlands in Svalbard and the northernmost developed to date. Multivariate statistical analysis shows that WTD and pore water pH are the dominant controls on testate amoeba species distribution. This finding is consistent with results from peatlands in lower latitudes with regard to WTD and supports work showing that when samples are taken across a long enough trophic gradient, peatland trophic status is an important control on the distribution of testate amoebae. No differences were found between transfer functions including and excluding the taxa with weak idiosomic tests (WISTs) that are most susceptible to decay. The final models for application to fossil samples therefore excluded these taxa. The WTD transfer function demonstrates the best performance (R-LOO(2) = 0.719, RMSEPLOO = 3.2 cm), but the pH transfer function also performs well (R-LOO(2) = 0.690, RMSEPLOO = 0.320). The transfer functions were applied to a core from western Spitsbergen and suggest drying conditions similar to 1750 CE, followed by a trend of recent wetting and increasing pH from similar to 1920 CE. These new transfer functions allow the reconstruction of past peatland WTD and pH in Svalbard, thereby enabling a greater understanding of long-term ecohydrological dynamics in these rapidly changing ecosystems. | ['amesbury', 'baird', 'beilman', 'channon', 'charman', 'gallego', 'sala', 'morris', 'sim', 'swindle'] | ","['amesbury', 'baird', 'beilman', 'channon', 'charman', 'gallego', 'sala', 'morris', 'sim', 'swindle']",3
91,"Effects of the Hekla 4 tephra on vegetation in Northwest Iceland | Vegetation plays a key role in preventing the remobilisation of tephra and aeolian activity following tephra fall. Recent volcanic eruptions in Iceland have highlighted the consequences of tephra fall for ecosystems and human health. Improved understanding of the mechanisms behind ecosystem recovery following tephra fall is particularly important for Iceland. Today similar to 42% of the country is classified as desert and unvegetated and sparsely vegetated areas are unable to trap tephra fall and prevent subsequent wind erosion. This paper presents palaeoenvironmental reconstructions before and after the Hekla 4 tephra from two lakes in Northwest Iceland, from within a woodland in the lowland, and in open woodland under stress at the highland margin. The c. 4,200 cal bp. Hekla 4 tephra is one of the most extensive Icelandic Holocene tephra layers and the eruption produced an estimated similar to 9 km(3) of tephra. The palaeoecological reconstructions provide an insight into the responses of two relatively stable ecosystems to thick tephra deposits during a period of cooling climate. The understory vegetation in the lowland woodland was buried by the tephra, however Betula pubescens trees were not severely affected and the woodland recovered relatively quickly. In contrast, open woodland at the highland margin that was already at its ecological limit, shifted to dwarf shrub heath, a more resilient vegetation community in response to the tephra fall and cooling climate. | ['eddudottir', 'erlendsson', 'gisladottir'] | ","['eddudottir', 'erlendsson', 'gisladottir']",4
92,"Effects of permafrost aggradation on peat properties as determined from a pan-Arctic synthesis of plant macrofossils | Permafrost dynamics play an important role in high-latitude peatland carbon balance and are key to understanding the future response of soil carbon stocks. Permafrost aggradation can control the magnitude of the carbon feedback in peatlands through effects on peat properties. We compiled peatland plant macrofossil records for the northern permafrost zone (515 cores from 280 sites) and classified samples by vegetation type and environmental class (fen, bog, tundra and boreal permafrost, and thawed permafrost). We examined differences in peat properties (bulk density, carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and organic matter content, and C/N ratio) and C accumulation rates among vegetation types and environmental classes. Consequences of permafrost aggradation differed between boreal and tundra biomes, including differences in vegetation composition, C/N ratios, and N content. The vegetation composition of tundra permafrost peatlands was similar to permafrost-free fens, while boreal permafrost peatlands more closely resembled permafrost-free bogs. Nitrogen content in boreal permafrost and thawed permafrost peatlands was significantly lower than in permafrost-free bogs despite similar vegetation types (0.9% versus 1.5% N). Median long-term C accumulation rates were higher in fens (23g C m(-2)yr(-1)) than in permafrost-free bogs (18g C m(-2)yr(-1)) and were lowest in boreal permafrost peatlands (14g C m(-2)yr(-1)). The plant macrofossil record demonstrated transitions from fens to bogs to permafrost peatlands, bogs to fens, permafrost aggradation within fens, and permafrost thaw and reaggradation. Using data synthesis, we have identified predominant peatland successional pathways, changes in vegetation type, peat properties, and C accumulation rates associated with permafrost aggradation. | ['camill', 'gallego', 'sala', 'garneau', 'harden', 'hugelius', 'jones', 'klein', 'kokfelt', 'kuhry', 'loisel', 'mathijssen', 'odonnell', 'oksanen', 'ronkainen', 'sannel', 'talbot', 'tarnocai', 'treat', 'valiranta'] | ","['camill', 'gallego', 'sala', 'garneau', 'harden', 'hugelius', 'jones', 'klein', 'kokfelt', 'kuhry', 'loisel', 'mathijssen', 'odonnell', 'oksanen', 'ronkainen', 'sannel', 'talbot', 'tarnocai', 'treat', 'valiranta']",1
93,"What is the effect of prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forest on biodiversity, beyond pyrophilous and saproxylic species? A systematic review | Background: While the effects of prescribed burning on tree regeneration and on pyrophilous and/or saproxylic species are relatively well known, effects on other organisms are less clear. The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Methods: The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified. Conclusions: Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets. Prescribed burning may have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent and careful planning is needed. | ['berne', 'cooke', 'eales', 'haddaway', 'jonsson', 'kouki', 'petrokofsky', 'taylor'] | ","['berne', 'cooke', 'eales', 'haddaway', 'jonsson', 'kouki', 'petrokofsky', 'taylor']",3
94,"Effects of recent climate and environmental changes on the ecology of a boreal forest lake in Manitoba, Canada | Application of paleoenvironmental approaches provides insight into the magnitude and timing of responses to climate warming in aquatic-ecosystems of northern Canada. We examined subfossil biological (Diptera:Chironomidae) and geochemical indicators (organic carbon and elemental nitrogen and stable isotope composition) in a sediment core from Buckland Lake, northern Manitoba, to assess the influence of recent warming (1981-2011) in the central subarctic region of Canada. The earlier part of the paleolimnological record (1830-1980) was characterized by relatively low chironomid diversity (N2 similar to 6), consisting primarily of profundal taxa (Orthocladius consobrinus and Chironomus), low organic matter content of sediments (< 12%), low C:N ratios (< 9), and high delta N-15 values (> 3 parts per thousand), indicative of a cold-water environment with low nitrogen demand. Between 1910 and 1980, there was a decline in profundal taxa, with small gradual increases in littoral taxa, such as Cladotanytarsus mancus-group. Post-1980 sediment core intervals had distinct geochemistry, with declines in delta C-13(org) from - 27.5 parts per thousand to almost - 29 parts per thousand, consistent with warming, increased terrestrial influence, and increased snowfall and runoff. We found substantial inferred warming (+ 1-2 degrees C), with several chironomid-inferred temperatures nearly 3 degrees C warmer than typical pre-1980 inferences. Concurrently, several warm-water-adapted littoral chironomid taxa (Cladopelma, Cryptochironomus, Polypedilum) recorded increases. The post-1990 records reflected continued increases in warm-water taxa, changes in the benthic:pelagic trophic structure, and reversal of previous trends in the delta C-13(org), %Organic Carbon, and delta N-15 profiles, suggestive of increased aquatic productivity. The meteorological station at Gillam, Manitoba, also recorded warming (1.5 degrees C) and a reduction in snowfall during that time period. A reduction in spring recharge may have increased littoral habitat associated with lake-level drawdown. The climate-driven shift observed similar to 1980 is in generally good agreement with other regional analyses, which show regime shifts occurred similar to 1995. The earlier lake response (similar to 1980), however, demonstrates the role of increased catchment-mediated influences on northern boreal lake productivity that may only appear in records with sufficiently high resolution and multiple paleolimnological indicators. | ['luszczek', 'medeiros', 'quinlan', 'wolfe'] | ","['luszczek', 'medeiros', 'quinlan', 'wolfe']",0
95,"Effects of shoreline permafrost thaw on nutrient dynamics and diatom ecology in a subarctic tundra pond | In permafrost landscapes, ponds and lakes are ubiquitous and important features that support long-term carbon storage and diverse diatom communities. With climate warming, thermokarst lake expansion may modify the ability of these aquatic systems to maintain these functions, as a consequence of changes to nutrient inputs and cycling. A recent (2006-2008) thermokarst shoreline expansion event adjacent to small Frisbee Pond, in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada, presented an opportunity to evaluate the effects of thaw-driven disturbance on pond nutrient dynamics. A sediment core was collected in 2015 and analysed for diatom assemblage composition, total nutrient (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) accumulation rates, and stable isotopes of organic carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). Results indicate that recent shoreline expansion in this subarctic peatland pond caused an increase in total diatom accumulation, although shifts in diatom community composition were initiated prior to the shoreline slump, particularly an increase in the relative abundance of Denticula kuetzingii. Nutrient accumulation rates in the sediment increased dramatically both prior to and following shoreline slumping, with isotope values indicating an increased supply of allochthonous carbon and atmospheric nitrogen. Investigations of hydroclimate conditions prior to the shoreline slump indicate warming of summer air temperatures and an increase in precipitation over the long-term mean, consistent with changing climate conditions that caused thermokarst disturbance in other permafrost environments. This study has important implications for understanding hydro-ecological responses of small surface water bodies to general climate forcing, in combination with rapid thermokarst shoreline expansion, under a changing climate. | ['hall', 'macrae', 'morison', 'petrone', 'volik', 'wiklund'] | ","['hall', 'macrae', 'morison', 'petrone', 'volik', 'wiklund']",1
96,"End of the cold war | Across the frozen lake in Russia's polar Urals region, people have suffered many problems due to the mild weather and this is a place where global warming will likely be happen. The reindeers and the herds are affected with the melted ice which will then affect the Nenets as they rely on these for their livelihood. Thus, with this changing environment, a study will be done where cores were collected from the muddy lake sediment. The organisms on each layer of the core will give informations on the biodiversity, productivity and characteristics of the changing environment over time. But of great interest was the minute head capsules of chironomid larvae which are useful indicators of past climate. Cores I have shown that there was a rapid increase in abundance and biodiversity of chironomid larvae in the late 20th century. An examination on the vegetation, aquatic fauna and the sediments of the lake could lead for the prediction of the climate change and may identify vulnerable habitats. | ['self'] | ",['self'],4
97,"Ending the Cinderella status of terraces and lynchets in Europe: the geomorphology of agricultural terraces and implications for ecosystem services and climate adaptation | Terraces and lynchets are ubiquitous worldwide and can provide increasingly important Ecosystem Services (ESs), which may be able to mitigate aspects of climate change. They are also a major cause of non-linearity between climate and erosion rates in agricultural systems as noted from alluvial and colluvial studies. New research in the 'critical zone' has shown that we must now treat soil production as an ecologically sensitive variable with implications for soil carbon sequestration. In this review and synthesis paper we present a modified classification of agricultural terraces, review the theoretical background of both terraces and lynchets, and show how new techniques are transforming the study of these widespread and often ancient anthropogenic landforms. The problems of dating terraces and the time-consuming nature of costly surveys have held back the geomorphological and geoarchaeological study of terraces until now. The suite of techniques now available, and reviewed here, includes Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) - Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, Airborne and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (ALS-TLS); optically stimulated luminescence (OSL and pOSL), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), Fourier-transform infra-red analysis (FTIR), phytoliths from plants, and potentially environmental DNA. Three process-related geomorphological questions arise from using this suite of methods; (a) can they provide both a chronology of formation and use history, (b) can we identify the sources of all the soil components? (c) Can terrace soil formation and ecosystem services be modelled at the slope to catchment scale? The answers to these questions can also inform the management of the large areas of abandoned and under-used terraces that are resulting from both the economics of farming and rural population changes. Where possible, examples are drawn from a recently started ERC project (TerrACE; ERC-2018-2023; https://www.terrace.no/) that is working at over 15 sites in Europe ranging from Norway to Greece. | ['albert', 'alsos', 'brown', 'cucchiaro', 'fallu', 'lang', 'oost', 'pear', 'snape', 'tarolli', 'waddington', 'walsh', 'zhao'] | ","['albert', 'alsos', 'brown', 'cucchiaro', 'fallu', 'lang', 'oost', 'pear', 'snape', 'tarolli', 'waddington', 'walsh', 'zhao']",3
98,"Environments during the spread of anatomically modern humans across Northern Asia 50-10 cal kyr BP: What do we know and what would we like to know? | Northern Asia (here, the Russian Federation east of the Urals) played a key role in the spread of anatomically modern humans (AMH) across the Eurasian continent during the Upper Palaeolithic (UP). This time interval witnessed the climatically harshest and most variable part of the last glacial epoch when AMH spread to all continents, with the exception of ice-covered Antarctica, thus raising questions about how humans and environments interacted. Our review of available proxy records shows that the study region was largely dominated by productive steppe and tundra plant communities, which promoted a diverse small- to mega-scale fauna throughout the UP. While this rich fauna was an ideal food resource for AMH populations, its possible influence on the growth of woody plants through grazing is less well resolved. Another non-climatic factor that may have impacted on the spread of woody taxa are human activities (e.g. setting fires to facilitate hunting). Evidence that small populations of woody taxa were distributed in climatically favourable habitats comes from plant macroremains from sediment sequences and archaeological sites and from aDNA data. Contrary to the long-standing view of a generally colder-than-present last glacial climate, these proxy records reveal evidence that summers were warmer than today by several degrees Celsius, providing additional advantages for human activities. Another benefit for large herbivores, and thus human subsistence, were the generally low winter precipitation levels (similar to those of the modern steppe regions of Mongolia), which sustained year-round grazing grounds. These factors apparently outweighed the harsh colder-than-present winter conditions and promoted habitation of AMH in Northern Asia even during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ca. 30-18 cal kyr BP. While our understanding of qualitative climate trends, mainly based on fossil pollen records, has substantially improved, quantification of climate parameters is still a challenging task. For the last glacial interval in Northern Asia, plant macroremains, chironomids, diatoms and ostracods may provide suitable alternative proxies. | ['leipe', 'tarasov', 'wagner'] | ","['leipe', 'tarasov', 'wagner']",2
99,"Environmental controls on the H-2/H-1 values of terrestrial leaf waxes in the eastern Canadian Arctic | The hydrogen isotope composition of plant waxes preserved in lacustrine sediments is a potentially valuable tool for reconstructing paleoenvironmental changes in the Arctic. However, in contrast to the mid-and low-latitudes, significantly less effort has been directed towards understanding the factors controlling D/H fractionation in high latitude plant waxes and the impact of these processes on the interpretation of sedimentary leaf wax delta D records. To better understand these processes, we examined the D/H ratios of long chain fatty acids in lake surface sediments spanning a temperature and precipitation gradient on Baffin Island in the eastern Canadian Arctic. D/H ratios of plant waxes increase with increasing temperature and aridity, with values ranging from -240 parts per thousand to -160 parts per thousand over the study area. Apparent fractionation factors between n-alkanoic acids in Arctic lake sediments and precipitation(epsilon(FA-ppt)) are less negative than those of mid-latitude lakes and modern plants by 25 parts per thousand to 65 parts per thousand, consistent with n-alkane data from modern Arctic plants (Yang et al., 2011). Furthermore, epsilon(FA-ppt) values from Arctic lakes become systematically more positive with increasing evaporation, in contrast to mid-latitude sites, which show little to no change in fractionation with aridity. These data are consistent with enhanced water loss and isotope fractionation at higher latitude in the Arctic summer, when continuous sunlight supports increased daily photosynthesis. The dominant control on delta D-FA variations on Baffin Island is temperature. However, changing epsilon(FA-ppt) result in steeper delta D-FA-temperature relationships than observed for modern precipitation. The application of this delta D-FA-based paleotemperature calibration to existing delta D-FA records from Baffin Island produces much more realistic changes in late Holocene temperature and highlights the importance of these effects in influencing the interpretation of Arctic delta D-FA records. A better understanding of the controls on hydrogen isotope fractionation in high latitude leaf waxes will be essential to the proper interpretation of isotope records from sedimentary plant waxes in the Arctic.

100,"Environmental correlates of the Late Quaternary regional extinctions of large and small Palaearctic mammals | Most studies of mammal extinctions during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition explore the relative effects of climate change vs human impacts on these extinctions, but the relative importance of the different environmental factors involved remains poorly understood. Moreover, these studies are strongly biased towards megafauna, which may have been more influenced by human hunting than species of small body size. We examined the potential environmental causes of Pleistocene-Holocene mammal extinctions by linking regional environmental characteristics with the regional extinction rates of large and small mammals in 14 Palaearctic regions. We found that regional extinction rates were larger for megafauna, but extinction patterns across regions were similar for both size groups, emphasizing the importance of environmental change as an extinction factor as opposed to hunting. Still, the bias towards megafauna extinctions was larger in southern Europe and smaller in central Eurasia. The loss of suitable habitats, low macroclimatic heterogeneity within regions and an increase in precipitation were identified as the strongest predictors of regional extinction rates. Suitable habitats for many species of the Last Glacial fauna were grassland and desert, but not tundra or forest. The low-extinction regions identified in central Eurasia are characterized by the continuous presence of grasslands and deserts until the present. In contrast, forest expansion associated with an increase in precipitation and temperature was likely the main factor causing habitat loss in the high-extinction regions. The shift of grassland into tundra also contributed to the loss of suitable habitats in northern Eurasia. Habitat loss was more strongly related to the extinctions of megafauna than of small mammals. Ungulate species with low tolerance to deep snow were more likely to go regionally extinct. Thus, the increase in precipitation at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition may have also directly contributed to the extinctions by creating deep snow cover which decreases forage availability in winter. | ['chytry', 'hais', 'horsak', 'pavelkova', 'ricankova', 'robovsky'] | ","['chytry', 'hais', 'horsak', 'pavelkova', 'ricankova', 'robovsky']",1

102,"Environmental change in Garry oak (Quercus garryana) ecosystems: The evolution of an eco-cultural landscape | Globally, colonialism resulted in the suppression of aboriginal land management practices, abetted by the concept of terra nullius, ""belonging to no one""; the belief that aboriginal people had little influence on or ownership of the land. Until recently, this ideology was entrenched in resource management and policy. Traditional ecological knowledge, historical ecology, archaeology, and palaeoecological research have shown these assumptions to be wrong. In this paper we take a multidisciplinary approach (biogeography, paleoecology, dendrochronology, and bioclimatic envelope modeling) to better understand the role of climate and fire in the formation of eco-cultural landscapes. We synthesize results from pollen and charcoal analysis in Garry oak ecosystems that indicate there were continuous and frequent prescribed burning events, with more severe fires occurring every 26-41 years in southwest British Columbia throughout the Anthropocene (~last 250 years) that substantially altered forest structure and composition. These results are consistent with stand age reconstructions in BC and Washington with Garry oak establishment beginning ~1850 AD, corresponding with modern fire exclusion, aboriginal population decline, and end of the Little Ice Age. Douglas-fir recruitment has been continuous since ~1900, with succession of oak woodland to closed conifer forest at most sites. These findings indicate that the structure of many Garry oak ecosystems have been profoundly influenced by eco-cultural practices. Overwhelming evidence indicates that in many cases these ecosystems are dependent on prescribed fire for their open structure. In the absence of aboriginal land-management practices, active management will be necessary to maintain Garry oak woodland. ¬© 2014 The Author(s). | ['gedalof', 'pellatt'] | ","['gedalof', 'pellatt']",0
103,"Holocene environmental history in high-Arctic North Greenland revealed by a combined biomarker and macrofossil approach | In this study, we use a combined biomarker and macrofossil approach to reconstruct the Holocene climate history recorded in Trifna SO, Skallingen area, eastern North Greenland. Chronological information is derived from comparison of lithological, biogeochemical and macrofossil characteristics with a well-dated record from nearby Lille Sneha SO. Following local deglaciation around c.8cal.kaBP, the local peak warmth occurred between c.7.4 and 6.2cal.kaBP as indicated by maximum macrofossil abundances of warmth-demanding plants (Salix arctica andDryas integrifolia) and invertebrates (Daphnia pulex and Chironomidae). Warm conditions were dominated by terrestrial organic matter (OM) sedimentation as implied by the alkane-based P-aq ratio, but increased aquatic productivity is indicated when temperature was highest around 6.5cal.kaBP. The n-C-29/n-C-31 alkane ratio shows that vegetation in the catchment was dominated by shrubs after deglaciation, but shifted towards relatively more grassy/herbaceous vegetation during peak warmth. After 5.4cal.kaBP, the disappearance of warmth-demanding plant and invertebrate macrofossils indicates cooling in the Skallingen area. This cooling was characterized by a significant shift towards dominance of aquatic OM sedimentation in Trifna SO as implied by high P-aq ratios. Cooling was also associated with a shift in vegetation type from dwarf-shrub heaths towards relatively more herbaceous vegetation in the catchment, stronger erosion and more oligotrophic conditions in the lake. Our data show that mean air temperatures inferred using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) do not seem to accurately reflect the local climatic history. Irrespective of calibration, methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT) palaeothermometry cannot be reconciled with the macrofossil evidence and seems to be biased by either changing brGDGT sources (insitu vs. soil-derived) or changing species assemblages and/or an unknown physiological responseto changing environmental conditions at high latitude. | ['bennike', 'kusch', 'lenz', 'rethemeyer', 'steffen', 'wagner'] | ","['bennike', 'kusch', 'lenz', 'rethemeyer', 'steffen', 'wagner']",4
104,"Environmental history: A piece in the puzzle for establishing plans for environmental management | Establishment of plans for environmental planning and management requires that a number of natural and societal factors must be taken into consideration. Insights into the inherent dynamics of nature as well as the role that past human activities have played for establishing the current condition of the landscape and the natural environment in general are essential. Many natural and man-made changes occur over time scales of decades or centuries, and these are difficult to comprehend without a historical perspective. Such a perspective can be obtained using palaeoecological studies, i.e. by geochemical and biological analyses of lake sediment and peat deposits. To illustrate the long-term dynamics of nature and particularly the role of man, we present here five case studies from Sweden concerning pollution, lake acidification, lake eutrophication, biodiversity, and landscape dynamics and conservation - topics of broad interests - and discuss benefits of including a longer time perspective in environmental management.

105,"1000 years of environmental change and human impact at Stora-Mork, southern Iceland: A multiproxy study of a dynamic and vulnerable landscape | Multiproxy pollen, sediment, plant macrofossil and subfossil insect analyses are used to explore environmental change at Stora-Mork in southern Iceland between ad 500 and 1500. Previous palaeoecological studies in Iceland have indicated that vegetation and landscape change rapidly succeeded the initial settlement of the island around ad 871, with strong environmental consequences. However, recent high-resolution studies in western and northern Iceland suggest that the timing and amplitude of these changes may be less uniform than previously assumed. The palaeoecological evidence from Stora-Mork shows an initially muted anthropogenic signal. Before the early tenth century, the area was characterized by damp birch and willow woodland. Large-scale human impact did not begin until after ad 920 when a change in land use to grazing and crop production is observed in the pollen, insect and plant macrofossil records. Shifts in vegetation and insect taxa and in aeolian deposition indicate that this activity resulted in woodland reduction, increased soil instability, eutrophication and land surface drying. The relatively late appearance of large-scale human impact at Stora-Mork is consistent with the tenth-century farm establishment suggested by the historical record, and the delay in settlement at the location may relate to an initial avoidance of labour-intensive woodland clearance and/or management of woodland resources. This paper adds to the emerging body of evidence that suggests that the scale and timing of the initial effect of the human presence on Icelandic environments was influenced by complex and varied climatic, landscape, vegetational and cultural factors. | ['bending', 'church', 'edward', 'erlendsson', 'vickers'] | ","['bending', 'church', 'edward', 'erlendsson', 'vickers']",0
106,"Holocene environmental changes in southern Kamchatka, Far Eastern Russia, inferred from a pollen and testate amoebae peat succession record | High resolution palaeoenvironmental records in Far-Eastern Russia are rare, and the Kamchatka Peninsula is among the least studied areas of the region. This paper describes a record spanning the last ca. 11,000 yr, obtained from a bog in the southern part of Kamchatka. The radiocarbon dated core was analysed for pollen, testate amoebae, charcoal and loss-on-ignition (LOI). The vegetation during the early Holocene was dominated by grasses (Poaceae), birch (Betula) and heath (Ericaceae p. p.). Around 10,300 cal yr BP there was a substantial change in the vegetation cover to shrub alder (Alnus viridis s.I.) stands with sedges and ferns (Polypodiophyta) as well as herbs such as meadow rue (Thalictrum) in the understory. In the surroundings of Utka peatlands started to form. The variations in the vegetation cover were most probably caused by climatic changes. At the beginning of sediment accumulation, before 10,300 cal yr BP, the composition of the vegetation points to cooler summers and/or decreased annual precipitation. Around 10,300 cal yr BP, changes in vegetation occurred due to rising temperatures and/or changed water regimes. Increased abundancies of dry indicating testate amoebae after 9100 cal yr BP point to intermediate to dry soil conditions. Between 8600 and 7700 cal yr BP tree alder (Alnus incana) was widely spread at the site which probably indicates optimal environmental conditions. The tephra layer at 381-384.5 cm (ca. 8500 cal yr BP) produces a strong impact on the testate amoebae assemblages. At 7700 cal yr BP there was a sudden drop of A. incana in the local vegetation. From this time on, A. incana and also A. viridis decrease continuously whereas Betula gradually increases. The upper part of the sequence (after 6300 cal yr BP) shows higher abundancies of meadowsweet (Filipendula) and sweet gale (Myrica) pollen. After 6300 cal yr BP, changes in testate amoebae demonstrate variable soil moisture conditions at the site. Between 3700 and 1800 cal yr BP, wet conditions dominate as dry indicating testate amoebae decrease. After 1800 cal yr BP soil conditions become more variable again but this time with dry dominating testate amoebae. In contrast to surrounding regions, there is no evidence of trees such as spruce or larch growing in the surroundings of the site even though those trees are characteristic of many eastern Siberian sites. This difference might be because of the maritime influence of the Okhotsk Sea. Even dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), which is currently widely dispersed in northern Kamchatka, became part of the local vegetation only during the last 700 yr.

107,"Holocene environmental change in subarctic aeolian dune fields: The chronology of sand dune re-activation events in relation to forest fires, palaeosol development and climatic variations in Finnish Lapland | Sand dune stratigraphy, radiocarbon-dated charcoal layers, palaeosol development and luminescence dating are used to reconstruct the Holocene environmental history of the dune fields in Finnish Lapland since deglaciation in the early Holocene (similar to 10,900-10,200 cal. BP). After rapid formation and stabilisation of parabolic dunes and the immigration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), forest fires are inferred to have played a key role in triggering episodes of aeolian erosion of the dunes (deflation) leading to 16 sand dune re-activation events. These events were widespread in the dune fields from similar to 8300 cal. BP and occurred with increasing frequency towards the late Holocene. Each event is interpreted as relating to local fires that occurred up to 100-400 years after the date of each charcoal layer; the radiocarbon age of the charcoal being affected by the age of the wood when burned, and the accumulation and/or recycling of charcoal from earlier fires. Well-developed buried iron podzols, which can develop within 500-1000 years, indicate prolonged phases of dune stability, four of which are dated to between 4500 and 1050 cal. BP. Indirect associations are evident between the sand dune re-activation events and climatic phases that were relatively cold and/or wet. These associations are explained by a conceptual geo-ecological model in which the effects of century- to millennial-scale climatic variability are modulated by the interactions between fire and vegetation. Thus, the subarctic dune field is viewed as a heterogeneous landscape of stable and unstable areas in space and through time. The unstable elements of this spatial mosaic become more extensive at times when the climatic environment promotes fire and deflation. | ['matthew', 'seppala'] | ","['matthew', 'seppala']",3
108,"Essential mineral nutrients of the high-latitude steppe vegetation and the herbivores of mammoth fauna | The geographical distribution of mammoth fauna was based not only on the optimal climatic range and suitable grass-rich ecosystems, but also on stable and sufficient pool of mineral nutrition in the seasonal cycle. Widespread high-latitude steppes or tundra-steppes were the landscape basis for the Beringia herbivores. Now patches of the relict steppes persist only on steep slopes with southern aspects. Numerous palynological, carpological, isotopic, and DNA data from the Pleistocene plant remains show that relict steppes are similar to mammoth steppe in many ways. A six-year study of ash and plant mineral contents of two types of steppes and grass-herb ecosystems at the Kolyma Lowland, Arctic Siberia has been carried out. The comparative content of essential mineral nutrients (Ca, P, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Fe, S) and the important element ratios in different vegetation types were analyzed. Results indicated that the ash and Ca, Mg contents are higher for the steppe vegetation. High Ca : P ratio and optimal K (Ca+Mg) or tetanic ratio in steppe plants are within the recommended range for large herbivores. Mineral nutrient contents are higher for herbs vs grasses for steppe taxa. Generally accumulation of essential mineral elements of the Siberian Arctic steppes is comparable to those in the Asian temperate steppes. The research results can be used for better understanding of such an important issues of paleoecology of large grazers as availability, sufficiency and equilibration of mineral nutrient elements of grass-rich ecosystems - one of the significant factors of megafauna existence.

It is found that mosses of the Sphagnum balticum group and the Shagnum fuscum group have different type of isotopic composition along the meridional gradient. The response of mosses of typical and nontypical habitats to changes in hydrothermal conditions is estimated using correlation and multiple regression analysis. The values of Œ¥ 13 C of the Sphagnum balticum mosses group have strong negative correlations with summer temperature characteristics of nontypical habitats and positive correlations with the precipitation regime and hydrothermal coefficient of all habitats. Significant positive correlations of the isotopic composition of Sphagnum fuscum group mosses are found only for a complex hydrothermal coefficient of typical habitats. A multiple regression model taking into account the sum of temperatures above 10¬∞C, the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficient, and winter precipitation explains from 26 to 58% of the observed variability of Œ¥ 13 C variations for all mosses and all habitats, with the exception of mosses of the Sphagnum fuscum group in all and typical habitats.

110,"Estimation of metapopulation colonization rates from disturbance history and occurrence-pattern data | Occurrence patterns of many sessile species in dynamic landscapes are not in equilibrium due to their slow rates of metapopulation colonization and extinction. Colonization-extinction data enable the estimation of colonization rates for such species, but collecting the necessary data may require long waiting times between sampling years. Methods for estimating colonization rates of nonequilibrium metapopulations from single occurrence-pattern data have so far relied on additional data on patch ages and on past patch connectivities. We present an approach where metapopulation colonization rates are estimated from occurrence-pattern data and from disturbance history data that inform of past patch dynamics and that can be collected together with occurrence-pattern data. We estimated parameter values regulating patch and metapopulation dynamics by simulating patch network and metapopulation histories that result in present-like patch network configurations and metapopulation occurrence patterns. We tested our approach using occurrence-pattern data of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria in Fennoscandian forests, and fire-scar data that inform of the 400-yr history of fires and host tree dynamics in the same landscapes. The estimated model parameters were similar to estimates obtained using colonization-extinction data. The projected L. pulmonaria occupancy into the future also agreed with the respective projections that were made using the model estimated from colonization-extinction data.

Warming has induced ecological changes that have impacted climate carbon-cycle feedbacks, making it important to understand the climate and vegetation controls on carbon (C) dynamics. Here we used the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM, 11-9kaBP, 1kaBP=1000calyr before present) in Alaska as a case study to examine how ecosystem Cdynamics responded to the past warming climate using an integrated approach of combining paleoecological reconstructions and ecosystem modeling. Our paleoecological synthesis showed expansion of deciduous broadleaf forest (dominated by Populus) into tundra and the establishment of boreal evergreen needleleaf and mixed forest during the second half of the HTM under a warmer- and wetter-than-before climate, coincident with the occurrence of the highest net primary productivity, cumulative net ecosystem productivity, soil C accumulation and CH4 emissions. These series of ecological and biogeochemical shifts mirrored the solar insolation and subsequent temperature and precipitation patterns during HTM, indicating the importance of climate controls on C dynamics. Our simulated regional estimate of CH4 emission rates from Alaska during the HTM ranged from 3.5 to 6.4TgCH4yr-1 and highest annual NPP of 470TgCyr-1, significantly higher than previously reported modern estimates. Our results show that the differences in static vegetation distribution maps used in simulations of different time slices have greater influence on modeled C dynamics than climatic fields within each time slice, highlighting the importance of incorporating vegetation community dynamics and their responses to climatic conditions in long-term biogeochemical modeling. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. | ['bochicchio', 'felzer', 'jones', 'mason', 'yu', 'zhuang'] | ","['bochicchio', 'felzer', 'jones', 'mason', 'yu', 'zhuang']",3
112,"Evaluating the response of cladocera to recent environmental changes in lakes from the central Canadian Arctic treeline region | Arctic and subarctic ecosystems have undergone considerable environmental changes in recent years as the result of climate warming. Fossil records of freshwater diatoms in lakes throughout the circumpolar Arctic, including the central Canadian Arctic treeline region, have revealed marked directional shifts in diatom assemblages in recent lake sediments. These algal changes have been linked to longer growing seasons, decreased duration of ice cover, and/or increased thermal stability. The effects of these recent environmental changes on higher trophic levels, such as the Cladocera, are still unclear. Using cladoceran remains preserved in the sediments of 50 lakes, which were previously examined for changes in diatoms, we show that significant changes in cladoceran species composition have occurred from pre-industrial times to the present. However, these changes are considerably muted compared to the more substantial changes observed in the diatom record. We found no consistent patterns of change in planktonic cladocerans (i.e. Daphnia, Bosmina) within our study lakes, and the response of the Cladocera to environmental changes does not appear to be strongly coupled to recent changes in diatom communities, thus further confirming that the previously observed diatom changes were related to bottom-up limnological controls. These results highlight the complex response of Arctic freshwater food webs to climate change, and the need for incorporating multi-trophic studies into climate change investigations. | ['laface', 'ruehland', 'smol', 'sweetman'] | ","['laface', 'ruehland', 'smol', 'sweetman']",0
113,"Evaluating the use of testate amoebae for palaeohydrological reconstruction in permafrost peatlands | The melting of high-latitude permafrost peatlands is a major concern due to a potential positive feedback on global climate change. We examine the ecology of testate amoebae in permafrost peatlands, based on sites in Sweden (similar to 200 km north of the Arctic Circle). Multivariate statistical analysis confirms that water-table depth and moisture content are the dominant controls on the distribution of testate amoebae, corroborating the results from studies in mid-latitude peatlands. We present a new testate amoeba-based water table transfer function and thoroughly test it for the effects of spatial autocorrelation, clustered sampling design and uneven sampling gradients. We find that the transfer function has good predictive power; the best-performing model is based on tolerance-downweighted weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (performance statistics with leave-one-out cross validation: R-2 = 0.87, RMSEP = 5.25 cm). The new transfer function was applied to a short core from Stordalen mire, and reveals a major shift in peatland ecohydrology coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age (c. AD 1400). We also applied the model to an independent contemporary dataset from Stordalen and find that it outperforms predictions based on other published transfer functions. The new transfer function will enable palaeohydrological reconstruction from permafrost peatlands in Northern Europe, thereby permitting greatly improved understanding of the long-term ecohydrological dynamics of these important carbon stores as well as their responses to recent climate change.

115,"Evaluation of limnological responses to recent environmental change and caribou activity in the Riviere George region, northern Quebec, Canada | The influence of natural terrestrial disturbances on the limnology of northern lakes is little known, yet important for understanding the ecology of these remote ecosystems. The Riviere George Caribou Herd (RGCH) in northern Quebec has undergone a large population increase since the 1950s, which has been accompanied by pronounced impacts (i.e., degradation of vegetation cover, soil erosion) on terrestrial environments of the Riviere George region. The goal of our study was to evaluate if the increased caribou activity and resulting terrestrial impacts have been accompanied by impacts on adjacent aquatic ecosystems. We studied the recent diatom assemblages (i.e., about the last two centuries) preserved in six sediment cores taken from lakes located in the most heavily impacted region, and in one core from a lake showing little evidence of recent caribou activity in the catchment basin. Core chronologies based on 210Pb dating techniques indicated that average mass sedimentation rates in this subarctic region were very low (0.0039 to 0.012 g cm-2 yr-1). Perhaps surprisingly, diatom assemblages from all seven cores showed very little change, indicating remarkably stable limnological conditions throughout the past apprx200 yr. The lack of a signal from caribou activity is most likely due to (1) short-term impacts being too transitory to be registered in the sediment record, and (2) long-term impacts not representing a significant perturbation outside the natural variability of these aquatic ecosystems. In contrast to other arctic regions, the limnological stability of our study sites suggests that recent climatic change impacts have been negligible in this region of northern Quebec, which seems to confirm climate model predictions that northern Quebec and Labrador will remain climatically stable under global warming scenarios. | ['laing', 'payette', 'pienitz'] | ","['laing', 'payette', 'pienitz']",0
116,"Re-evaluation of native plant species for seeding and grazing by livestock on the semiarid prairie of western Canada | There is a growing interest in the re-vegetation of disturbed prairie sites, including annual crop lands, with native species. Previous research from the Mixed Grassland ecoregion, or semiarid prairie region, of western Canada has found that introduced forage species, such as crested wheatgrass, produce more spring forage with better nutritive value than native species, suggesting that native species exhibit little agronomic merit. However, new research indicates that native species may be useful for extending forage productivity and the grazing season into the late summer, fall and winter. Native species also contribute to biodiversity, reduce non-forage invasive species problems, and enhance wildlife habitat in this region. They may also contribute to increased soil carbon sequestration, and increased ecosystem stability, despite increasing aridity due to climate change. Future opportunities in native plant research and development include a focus on developing methods of reliable native seed production by genetic enhancement, agronomic practices, or both strategies. | ['iwaasa', 'jefferson', 'mcleod', 'schellenberg'] | ","['iwaasa', 'jefferson', 'mcleod', 'schellenberg']",0
117,"Evidence of changing intrinsic water-use efficiency under rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations in Boreal Fennoscandia from subfossil leaves and tree ring delta 13C ratios | Investigating the many internal feedbacks within the climate system is a vital component of the effort to quantify the full effects of future anthropogenic climate change. The stomatal apertures of plants tend to close and decrease in number under elevated CO2 concentrations, increasing water-use efficiency (WUE) and reducing canopy evapotranspiration. Experimental and modelling studies reveal huge variations in these changes such that the warming associated with reduced evapotranspiration (known as physiological forcing) is neither well understood or constrained. Palaeo-observations of changes in stomatal response and plant WUE under rising CO2 might be used to better understand the processes underlying the physiological forcing feedback and to link measured changes in plant WUE to a specific physiological change in stomata. Here we use time series of tree ring (Pinus sylvestris L.) delta 13C and subfossil leaf (Betula nana L.) measurements of stomatal density and geometry to derive records of changes in intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and maximum stomatal conductance in the Boreal zone of northern Finland and Sweden. We investigate the rate of change in both proxies, over the recent past. The independent lines of evidence from these two different Boreal species indicate increased iWUE and reduced maximum stomatal conductance of similar magnitude from preindustrial times (ca. ad 1850) to around ad 1970. After this maximum stomatal conductance continues to decrease to ad 2000 in B. nana but iWUE in P. sylvestris reaches a plateau. We suggest that northern boreal P. sylvestris might have reached a threshold in its ability to increase WUE as CO2 rises. | ['finsinger', 'gagen', 'jalkanen', 'kirchhefer', 'loader', 'mccarroll', 'robertson', 'wagner', 'cremer', 'young'] | ","['finsinger', 'gagen', 'jalkanen', 'kirchhefer', 'loader', 'mccarroll', 'robertson', 'wagner', 'cremer', 'young']",3
118,"Evidence for ecosystem state shifts in Alaskan continuous permafrost peatlands in response to recent warming | Peatlands in continuous permafrost regions represent a globally-important store of organic carbon, the stability of which is thought to be at risk under future climatic warming. To better understand how these ecosystems may change in a warmer future, we use a palaeoenvironmental approach to reconstruct changes in two peatlands near Toolik Lake on Alaska's North Slope (TFS1 and TFS2). We present the first testate amoeba-based reconstructions from peatlands in continuous permafrost, which we use to infer changes in water-table depth and porewater electrical conductivity during the past two millennia. TFS1 likely initiated during a warm period between 0 and 300 CE. Throughout the late-Holocene, both peatlands were minerotrophic fens with low carbon accumulation rates (means of 18.4 and 14.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for cores TFS1 and TFS2 respectively). However, since the end of the Little Ice Age, both fens have undergone a rapid transition towards oligotrophic peatlands, with deeper water tables and increased carbon accumulation rates (means of 59.5 and 48.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for TFS1 and TFS2 respectively). We identify that recent warming has led to these two Alaskan rich fens to transition into poor fens, with greatly enhanced carbon accumulation rates. Our work demonstrates that some Arctic peatlands may become more productive with future regional warming, subsequently increasing their ability to sequester carbon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

119,"Evidence of hybridisation between Betula pubescens and B. nana in Iceland during the early Holocene | The aim of this study was to find evidence of Holocene hybridisation between downy birch (Betula pubescens) and dwarf birch (B. nano) in Iceland. We measured Betula pollen from an early Holocene peat profile from Hella in Eyjafjordur, mid-northern Iceland, with 39 samples taken at ca. 100-yr intervals between ca. 10.3 and 7.0 cal. ka BP based on known tephra layers. Species proportions were estimated and compared with data on present-day birch pollen. We found that Betula pollen from old samples prepared in glycerol was larger than the pollen in parallel samples mounted in silicon oil by a factor of 1.2 to 1.6, depending on the age of the peat. Therefore the analysis of Hella peat profile was entirely based on size frequency distribution within samples. The size frequency distribution of Betula pollen changed throughout the profile. In all samples, two normal curves with different means gave good fit to the observed frequency distribution, which denoted small pollen of B. nana and large pollen of B. pubescens. A low proportion of B. pubescens pollen was found in the oldest peat samples and again around 7.8 cal. ka BP, when B. nana predominated. The proportion of B. pubescens pollen peaked approximately at 8.7 and 7.2 cal. ka BP. Evidence of Betula hybrids was found in several samples, especially simultaneously with the earlier B. pubescens peak. Pollen with low DIP ratios (hybrid pollen) was found at different frequencies throughout the profile. Non-triporate Betula pollen grains, which are frequent among present-day triploid hybrids, were observed in most samples. The frequency of non-triporate pollen in a period between 9.2 and 8.7 cal. ka BP far exceeded the average level produced by the present-day triploid hybrids. Climatic and ecological conditions may have favoured hybridisation of birch species during the expansion of downy birch over dwarf birch colonies in warm periods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

120,"Evidence and implications of recent climate change in northern Alaska and other arctic regions | The Arctic climate is changing. Permafrost is warming, hydrological processes are changing and biological and social systems are also evolving in response to these changing conditions. Knowing how the structure and function of arctic terrestrial ecosystems are responding to recent and persistent climate change is paramount to understanding the future state of the Earth system and how humans will need to adapt. Our holistic review presents a broad array of evidence that illustrates convincingly; the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response to an altered climatic state. New extreme and seasonal surface climatic conditions are being experienced, a range of biophysical states and processes influenced by the threshold and phase change of freezing point are being altered, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are shifting, and more regularly human sub-systems are being affected. Importantly, the patterns, magnitude and mechanisms of change have sometimes been unpredictable or difficult to isolate due to compounding factors. In almost every discipline represented, we show how the biocomplexity of the Arctic system has highlighted and challenged a paucity of integrated scientific knowledge, the lack of sustained observational and experimental time series, and the technical and logistic constraints of researching the Arctic environment.

121,"Evidence for Mass-Independent Fractionation of Mercury Isotopes by Microbial Activities Linked to Geographically and Temporally Varying Climatic Conditions in Arctic and Subarctic Lakes | Cores from Arctic and subarctic Canadian lakes were subjected to isotopic, chemical, micropaleontological, and geochronological analyses for the purpose of investigating mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of mercury isotopes. The cores preserved records of early twentieth century climatic warming (approximate to 1915-1940), subsequent cooling (approximate to 1940-1970), and renewed warming (approximate to 1970-2004) [phases W1, C1, and W2, respectively]. Per mil deviations of Hg-199/Hg-202 and Hg-201/Hg-202 ratios due to MIF (Hg-199 and Hg-201 values) correlated with biological and biogeochemical factors linked to geographical and temporal climatic variations but varied, in large part, independently of each other. Hg-201 tended to increase from east to west. Among subarctic lakes this trend paralleled westward decreases in annual precipitation, diatom concentration, and the post-1990 organic carbon/pre-1900 organic carbon ratio, and Hg-201 increased in the order C1 W1 < W2. Hg-201 varied inversely with diatom concentration, but Hg-199 increased with increasing abundance of cyanobacteria. Arctic lakes, however, showed a south-to-north decrease in Hg-199/Hg-201 ratios, paralleling a decrease in annual precipitation and an increase in Chlorophyta and cyanobacteria. -values of individual lakes depended on the abundances of specific phylogenetic groups of phytoplankton, pyrolysis products of organic matter, and manganese, and on the manganese/iron ratios of oxyhydroxides, displaying clear separation of data representing different climatic trends. These results suggest that MIF was caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria which decomposed dead phytoplankton and mediated oxidation-reduction reactions of manganese and iron, and that the nature and isotope-fractionating activities of the microflora varied with climate-related environmental and biotic factors, including the community structure of the phytoplankton. | ['jackson'] | ",['jackson'],0
122,"Experimental approaches to predicting the future of tundra plant communities | Predicting the future of tundra plant communities is a major intellectual and practical challenge and it can only be successful if underpinned by an understanding of the evolutionary history and genetics of tundra plant species, their ecophysiology, and their responsiveness (both individually and as component parts of communities) to multiple environmental change drivers. This paper considers the types of experimental approaches that have been used to understand and to predict the future of tundra plant communities and ecosystems. In particular, the use of 'environmental manipulation' experiments in the field is described, and the merits and limitations of this type of approach are considered with specific reference to the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) as an example to indicate the key principles. The approach is compared with palaeo-environmental investigations (using archives-or proxies-of past change) and the study of environmental gradients (so-called 'space-for-time substitution') to understand potential future change. Environmental manipulation experiments have limitations associated with, for example, short timescales, treatment artefacts, and trade-offs between technical sophistication and breadth of deployment in heterogeneous landscapes/regions. They do, however, provide valuable information on seasonal through decadal phenological, growth, reproductive, and ecosystem responses which have a direct bearing on ecosystem-atmosphere coupling, species interactions and, potentially, trophic cascades. Designed appropriately, they enable researchers to test specific hypotheses and to record the dynamics of ecosystem responses to change directly, thus providing a robust complement to palaeo-environmental investigations, gradient studies and ecosystem modelling. | ['wookey'] | ",['wookey'],1
123,"Finding a Consensus on Credible Features among Several Paleoclimate Reconstructions | We propose a method to merge several paleoclimate time series into one that exhibits a consensus on the features of the individual times series. The paleoclimate time series can be noisy, nonuniformly sampled and the dates at which the paleoclimate is reconstructed can have errors. Bayesian inference is used to model the various sources of uncertainty and smoothing of the posterior distribution of the consensus is used to capture its credible features in different time scales. The technique is demonstrated by analyzing a collection of six Holocene temperature reconstructions from Finnish Lapland based on various biological proxies. Although the paper focuses on paleoclimate time series, the proposed method can be applied in other contexts where one seeks to infer features that are jointly supported by an ensemble of irregularly sampled noisy time series. | ['erasto', 'holmstrom', 'korhola', 'weckstrom'] | ","['erasto', 'holmstrom', 'korhola', 'weckstrom']",1

Here we use an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity to study the first-order effect of NP on global carbon cycle dynamics in the Holocene. We prescribe the reconstructed NP growth based on data obtained from numerous sites (located in Western Siberia, North America, and Finland) where peat accumulation records have been developed. Using an inverse method, we demonstrate that the long-term debates over potential source and/or sink of terrestrial ecosystem in the Holocene are clarified by using an inverse method, and our results suggest that the primary carbon source for the changes (sinks) of atmospheric and terrestrial carbon is the ocean, presumably, due to the deep ocean sedimentation pump ( the so-called alkalinity pump).

The record covers the period c. 10700 to 3300cal. a BP and is complemented by pollen data. Measures of species richness, sample evenness and beta diversity were calculated based on sedaDNA sampling intervals and 1000-year time windows. We identified 101 vascular plant and 17 bryophyte taxa, a high proportion (86%) of which are still growing within the region today. The high species richness (>60 taxa) observed in the Early Holocene, including representatives from all important plant functional groups, shows that modern shrub-tundra communities, and much of their species complement, were in place as early as c. 10700cal. a BP. We infer that postglacial colonization of the area occurred prior to the full Holocene, during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, Younger Dryas stadial or earlier. Abundant DNA of the extra-limital aquatic plant Callitriche hermaphroditica suggests it expanded its range northward between c.10200 and 9600cal. a BP, when summers were warmer than present. High values of Pinus DNA occur throughout the record, but we cannot say with certainty if they represent prior local presence; however, pollen influx values >500 grains cm(-2) a(-1) between c.8000 and 7300cal. a BP strongly suggest the presence of pine woodland during this period. As the site lies beyond the modern tree limit of pine, it is likely that this expansion also reflects a response to warmer Early Holocene summers. | ['alsos', 'ancin', 'murguzur', 'brathen', 'brown', 'clarke', 'edward', 'gielly', 'goslar', 'heintzman', 'lammers'] | ","['alsos', 'ancin', 'murguzur', 'brathen', 'brown', 'clarke', 'edward', 'gielly', 'goslar', 'heintzman', 'lammers']",4

However, forage quality (contents of macroelements and fibre fractions) of the leaves of common woody species is often inadequate. The aim of our study was to determine forage quality of leaves of Betula nana, Betula pubescens, Salix lanata, Salix phylicifolia and Sorbus aucuparia from Iceland and to compare it with the forage quality of the common native grass Deschampsia cespitosa and the introduced grass Alopecurus pratensis used by contemporary Icelandic farmers for forage production. Samples were collected at four localities in Iceland in late June 2013 and analysed for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), neutral and acid-detergent fibre and lignin concentration. Analyses were compared with the optimum range for cattle and sheep nutrition. The nutritive value of leaves of the Icelandic woody species was relatively high, and analysis showed their nutritive content satisfied both cattle and sheep nutrient requirements for N, P, K, Ca and Mg, but the relatively high content of indigestible lignin in all woody species could cause problems for livestock metabolism. Grasses were characterized by lower P, Ca and Mg, but substantially higher K concentrations, and higher N:P and K:(Mg+Ca) ratios. The forage quality of leaves of woody species increased in the order B.nana<B.pubescens<S.phylicifolia<S.aucuparia<S.lanata.

128,"Fossil midges and palaeosalinity: potential as indicators of hydrological balance and sea-level change | Saline lakes possess midge communities whose composition reflects the range in annual salt concentration fluctuations within the lake basin. Chironomid remains accumulating in such lakes may be used as archives for reconstructing past salinity changes. Quantitative palaeosalinity reconstructions are now available for lakes in parts of Canada and Africa. In and and semi-arid regions, much potential exists for relating these midge-inferred salinities to past changes in climate. Salinities at these sites may reflect past hydrological changes, especially changes in evaporation/precipitation balance. Recent analyses of coastal lakes in Norway demonstrate that midge fossils are also potentially useful indicators of sea-level changes. Limitations to midge-inferred palaeosalinity reconstructions include non-climate reasons for changes in salinity, such as variation in ionic input and local hydrology, and additional influences on community composition, such as midge habitat preferences, selective predation, and metal toxicity.

Changes are already ongoing in Arctic systems, but there is a lack of coordinated monitoring of Arctic freshwaters that hinders our ability to assess changes in biodiversity. To address the need for coordinated monitoring on a circumpolar scale, the Arctic Council working group, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, established the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is an adaptive monitoring program for the Arctic centred around four ecosystem themes (i.e., Freshwater, Terrestrial, Coastal, Marine). The freshwater theme developed a monitoring plan for Arctic freshwater biodiversity and recently completed the first assessment of status and trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program‚ÄìFreshwater has compiled and analysed a database of Arctic freshwater monitoring data to form the first report of the state of circumpolar Arctic freshwater biodiversity. This special issue presents the scientific analyses that underlie the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program‚ÄìFreshwater report and provides analyses of spatial and temporal diversity patterns and the multiple-stressor scenarios that act on the biological assemblages and biogeochemistry of Arctic lakes and rivers. This special issue includes regional patterns for selected groups of organisms in Arctic rivers and lakes of northern Europe, Russia, and North America. Circumpolar assessments for benthic diatoms, macrophytes, plankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish demonstrate how climate change and associated environmental drivers affect freshwater biodiversity. Also included are papers on spatial and temporal trends in water chemistry across the circumpolar region, and a systematic review of documented Indigenous Knowledge that demonstrates its potential to support assessment and conservation of Arctic freshwaters. This special issue includes the first circumpolar assessment of trends in Arctic freshwater biodiversity and provides important baseline information for future assessments and studies. It represents the largest compilation and assessment of Arctic freshwater biodiversity data to date and strives to provide a holistic view of ongoing change in these ecosystems to support future monitoring efforts. By identifying gaps in monitoring data across the circumpolar region, as well as identifying best practices for monitoring and assessment, this special issue presents an important resource for researchers, policy makers, and Indigenous and local communities that can support future assessments of ecosystem change. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

130,"Freshwater pearl mussels from northern Sweden serve as long-term, high-resolution stream water isotope recorders | The stable isotope composition of lacustrine sediments is routinely used to infer Late Holocene changes in precipitation over Scandinavia and, ultimately, atmospheric circulation dynamics in the North Atlantic realm. However, such archives only provide a low temporal resolution (ca. 15 years), precluding the ability to identify changes on inter-annual and quasi-decadal timescales. Here, we present a new, high-resolution reconstruction using shells of freshwater pearl mussels, iMargaritifera margaritifera/i, from three streams in northern Sweden. We present seasonally to annually resolved, calendar-aligned stable oxygen and carbon isotope data from 10 specimens, covering the time interval from 1819 to 1998. The bivalves studied formed their shells near equilibrium with the oxygen isotope signature of ambient water and, thus, reflect hydrological processes in the catchment as well as changes, albeit damped, in the isotope signature of local atmospheric precipitation.

131,"Frost creep and gelifluction features: A review | Frost creep and gelifluction are the cold-climate representatives of mass-wasting processes that occur in a broad range of environments. Neither process requires permafrost, and frost creep can be inhibited by its presence at shallow depth. Acting in various combinations, frost creep and gelifluction produce distinctive lobate and terrace-like landforms, which are easy to recognize while fresh and active, but difficult to distinguish from mudflow lobes, earthslides, and similar deposits after they have been modified by other processes. Large frost creep and gelifluction features are currently active in many tundra environments that experience only deep seasonal freezing; thus they are not generally considered to be indicators of permafrost. Most radio-carbon-dated lobes and terraces, however, seem to have originated at times when permafrost was more widespread than it is today. This is true in the Colorado Front Range, where the formation of lobes and terraces appears to have been initiated by rapid melting of ice-enriched permafrost during the warming phases of frost-heave cycles that were centuries or millennia in duration. There is growing evidence that lobes and terraces developed in many parts of the world between about 3000 and 2500 BP; the climatic significance of their formation during this interval is open to several interpretations. Long-term average rates of frontal advance, calculated for deposits in Colorado, Australia, Greenland, Yukon Territory, Alaska, Scotland, and Norway, range from 0.6 to 3.5 mm per calendar year, significantly slower than maximum rates of movement measured on the surfaces of active lobes and terraces in comparable environments; the features are clearly not as effective at transporting debris as was previously supposed. Variations in past rates of downslope soil movement, estimated from close-interval dating of buried humus horizons or plant remains overrun by the advancing fronts of lobes and terraces, provide a sensitive record of climatic change. The dated humus layers are also suitable for detailed pollen analyses and soil chronosequence studies. ¬© 1976. | ['benedict'] | ",['benedict'],3
132,"Functional diversity and trait composition of vascular plant and Sphagnum moss communities during peatland succession across land uplift regions | Most of the carbon accumulated into peatlands is derived from Sphagnum mosses. During peatland development, the relative share of vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses in the plant community changes, which impacts ecosystem functions. Little is known on the successional development of functional plant traits or functional diversity in peatlands, although this could be a key for understanding the mechanisms behind peatland resistance to climate change. Here we aim to assess how functionality of successive plant communities change along the autogenic peatland development and the associated environmental gradients, namely peat thickness and pH, and to determine whether trait trade-offs during peatland succession are analogous between vascular plant and moss communities.We collected plant community and trait data on successional peatland gradients from post-glacial rebound areas in coastal Finland, Sweden and Russia, altogether from 47 peatlands. This allowed us to analyse the changes in community-weighted mean trait values and functional diversity (diversity of traits) during peatland development.Our results show comparative trait trade-offs from acquisitive species to conservative species in both vascular plant and Sphagnum moss communities during peatland development. However, mosses had higher resistance to environmental change than vascular plant communities. This was seen in the larger proportion of intraspecific trait variation than species turnover in moss traits, while the proportions were opposite for vascular plants. Similarly, the functional diversity of Sphagnum communities increased during the peatland development, while the opposite occurred for vascular plants. Most of the measured traits showed a phylogenetic signal. More so, the species common to old successional stages, namely Ericacae and Sphagna from subgroup Acutifolia were detected as most similar to their phylogenetic neighbours.Synthesis. During peatland development, vegetation succession leads to the dominance of conservative plant species accustomed to high stress. At the same time, the autogenic succession and ecological engineering of Sphagna leads to higher functional diversity and intraspecific variability, which together indicate higher resistance towards environmental perturbations. | ['jassey', 'kutznetsov', 'laine', 'lindholm', 'nilsson', 'tuittila'] | ","['jassey', 'kutznetsov', 'laine', 'lindholm', 'nilsson', 'tuittila']",3
133,"Fungal palaeodiversity revealed using high-throughput metabarcoding of ancient DNA from arctic permafrost | The taxonomic and ecological diversity of ancient fungal communities was assessed by combining next generation sequencing and metabarcoding of DNA preserved in permafrost. Twenty-six sediment samples dated 1600032000 radiocarbon years old from two localities in Siberia were analysed for fungal ITS. We detected 75 fungal OTUs from 21 orders representing three phyla, although rarefaction analyses suggested that the full diversity was not recovered despite generating an average of 6677 +/- 3811 (mean +/- SD) sequences per sample and that preservation bias likely has considerable effect on the recovered DNA. Most OTUs (75.4%) represented ascomycetes. Due to insufficient sequencing depth, DNA degradation and putative preservation biases in our samples, the recovered taxa probably do not represent the complete historic fungal community, and it is difficult to determine whether the fungal communities varied geographically or experienced a composition shift within the period of 1600032000 bp. However, annotation of OTUs to functional ecological groups provided a wealth of information on the historic communities. About one-third of the OTUs are presumed plant-associates (pathogens, saprotrophs and endophytes) typical of graminoid- and forb-rich habitats. We also detected putative insect pathogens, coprophiles and keratinophiles likely associated with ancient insect and herbivore faunas. The detection of putative insect pathogens, mycoparasites, aquatic fungi and endophytes broadens our previous knowledge of the diversity of fungi present in Beringian palaeoecosystems. A large group of putatively psychrophilic/psychrotolerant fungi was also detected, most likely representing a modern, metabolically active fungal community. | ['bellemain', 'boessenkool', 'brochmann', 'coissac', 'davey', 'edward', 'epp', 'geml', 'gussarova', 'kauserud', 'taberlet', 'willerslev'] | ","['bellemain', 'boessenkool', 'brochmann', 'coissac', 'davey', 'edward', 'epp', 'geml', 'gussarova', 'kauserud', 'taberlet', 'willerslev']",3
134,"Future directions and priorities for Arctic bryophyte research | The development of evidence-based international strategies for the conservation and management of Arctic ecosystems in the face of climate change is hindered by critical knowledge gaps in Arctic floristic diversity and evolution. Particularly poorly studied are the bryophytes, which dominate the vegetation across vast areas of the Arctic and consequently play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles. Currently, much of what is known about Arctic floristic evolution is based on studies of vascular plants. Bryophytes, however, possess a number of features, such as poikilohydry, totipotency, several reproductive strategies, and the ability to disperse through microscopic diaspores, that may cause their responses to Arctic environments to differ from those of the vascular plants. Here we discuss several priority areas identified in the Arctic Council's ""Arctic Biodiversity Assessment"" that are necessary to illuminate patterns of Arctic bryophyte evolution and diversity, including dispersal, glacial refugia, local adaptation, and ecological interactions with bryophyte- associated microbiomes. A survey of digitally available herbarium data archived in the largest online aggregate, GBIF, across the Arctic to boreal zones indicates that sampling coverage of mosses is heterogeneous and relatively sparse in the Arctic sensu stricto. A coordinated international effort across the Arctic will be necessary to address knowledge gaps in Arctic bryophyte diversity and evolution in the context of ongoing climate change. | ['biersma', 'convey', 'goffinet', 'hassel', 'ickert', 'bond', 'kruijer', 'la', 'farge', 'lewis', 'mcdaniel', 'metzgar', 'stech', 'villarreal'] | ","['biersma', 'convey', 'goffinet', 'hassel', 'ickert', 'bond', 'kruijer', 'la', 'farge', 'lewis', 'mcdaniel', 'metzgar', 'stech', 'villarreal']",0
135,"Genetic data from algae sedimentary DNA reflect the influence of environment over geography | Genetic investigations on eukaryotic plankton confirmed the existence of modern biogeographic patterns, but analyses of palaeoecological data exploring the temporal variability of these patterns have rarely been presented. Ancient sedimentary DNA proved suitable for investigations of past assemblage turnover in the course of environmental change, but genetic relatedness of the identified lineages has not yet been undertaken. Here, we investigate the relatedness of diatom lineages in Siberian lakes along environmental gradients (i.e. across treeline transects), over geographic distance and through time (i.e. the last 7000 years) using modern and ancient sedimentary DNA. Our results indicate that closely-related Staurosira lineages occur in similar environments and less-related lineages in dissimilar environments, in our case different vegetation and co-varying climatic and limnic variables across treeline transects. Thus our study reveals that environmental conditions rather than geographic distance is reflected by diatom-relatedness patterns in space and time. We tentatively speculate that the detected relatedness pattern in Staurosira across the treeline could be a result of adaptation to diverse environmental conditions across the arctic boreal treeline, however, a geographically-driven divergence and subsequent repopulation of ecologically different habitats might also be a potential explanation for the observed pattern. | ['epp', 'herzschuh', 'klemm', 'pestryakova', 'stoof', 'leichsenring', 'tiedemann'] | ","['epp', 'herzschuh', 'klemm', 'pestryakova', 'stoof', 'leichsenring', 'tiedemann']",3
136,"A geochemical perspective on the natural abundance and predominant sources of trace elements in cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccus) from remote bogs in the Boreal region of northern Alberta, Canada | Trace elements in native cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus) were compared with the underlying Sphagnum moss on which it grows, from two remote ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peat bogs in northern Alberta, Canada. The purpose of the comparison was to distinguish between dust inputs to the berries versus plant uptake from the substrate, and to determine the natural abundance of trace elements in native berries. Using Al as an indicator of the abundance of soil-derivedmineral particles, the abundance of dust on the surface of the berries is 20 to 29x lower than that of the substrate (moss). Other lithophile elements (V, Cr, Co, Ga, Li and Y) show similar differences between moss and berry. The concentrations of Rb and Ba in berries were similar tomoss and Sr within a factor of 3 to 4x, probably reflecting passive uptake of these lithophile elements by the plants, even though they have no known physiological function. Of themicronutrients examined (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn andMo), Cu and Mnwere more abundant in berries than moss, Ni and Zn yielded similar concentrations in both whereas Fe followed by Mo showed the greatest concentration difference. For these micronutrients, uptake by the plants through their roots via the substrate (moss and peat) outweighs contributions from atmospheric dusts.In respect to potentially toxic ""heavymetals"", Pb concentrations in the moss (BMW, 89 +/- 7.3 mu g/kg; CMW, 93 +/- 27 mu g/kg) are below the natural, ""background"" values reported for ancient layers of Swiss peat from the mid-Holocene (>6000 years old). The Pb concentrations in the berries, however, are 19 to 47x lower than in the underlying moss indicating that Pb in the berries, like Al, is exclusively supplied by dust. Cadmiumin the berries is at or above the level found in moss due to active uptake by the plants from the substrate, most likely because of the chemical similarity of this element to Zn. Silver, Sb and Tl in the berries were bLOD, but assuming that they are supplied exclusively by dust inputs, their concentrations in the berries can be estimated from the Al concentrations. Taken together, these data provide an estimate of the natural abundance of these elements in berries, based on measured (Cd, Pb) and calculated (Ag, Sb, Tl) values.

138,"A global database of Holocene paleotemperature records | A comprehensive database of paleoclimate records is needed to place recent warming into the longer-term context of natural climate variability. We present a global compilation of quality-controlled, published, temperature-sensitive proxy records extending back 12,000 years through the Holocene. Data were compiled from 679 sites where time series cover at least 4000 years, are resolved at sub-millennial scale (median spacing of 400 years or finer) and have at least one age control point every 3000 years, with cut-off values slackened in data-sparse regions. The data derive from lake sediment (51%), marine sediment (31%), peat (11%), glacier ice (3%), and other natural archives. The database contains 1319 records, including 157 from the Southern Hemisphere. The multi-proxy database comprises paleotemperature time series based on ecological assemblages, as well as biophysical and geochemical indicators that reflect mean annual or seasonal temperatures, as encoded in the database.

139,"Global perspectives on the impact of drastic environmental changes in hunter-gatherer technologies | Researchers have long debated the impact of climate change on human culture and particularly in hunter-gatherer societies.

Recent advances in paleoclimatic reconstructions and ongoing developments in the quality and chronological resolution of archeological data have allowed a better understanding of the extent to which patterns of specific environmental changes triggered modifications in the technological systems of hunter-gatherers. This volume brings together contributions addressing strategic changes in the organization of hunter-gatherer technologies as a response to drastic environmental shifts. It includes topics such as lithic, organic tools and ceramic production, pyrotechnology, hunting strategies, pigment processing, use of plants and adornments, starting with Middle Stone Age and ending with Mesolithic and coming from a diversity of geographical contexts.

140,"Global vegetation and terrestrial carbon cycle changes after the last ice age | In current models, the ecophysiological effects of CO2 create both woody thickening and terrestrial carbon uptake, as observed now, and forest cover and terrestrial carbon storage increases that took place after the last glacial maximum (LGM). Here, we aimed to assess the realism of modelled vegetation and carbon storage changes between LGM and the pre-industrial Holocene (PIH). We applied Land Processes and eXchanges (LPX), a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM), with lowered CO2 and LGM climate anomalies from the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP II), and compared the model results with palaeodata. Modelled global gross primary production was reduced by 27-36% and carbon storage by 550-694 Pg C compared with PIH. Comparable reductions have been estimated from stable isotopes. The modelled areal reduction of forests is broadly consistent with pollen records. Despite reduced productivity and biomass, tropical forests accounted for a greater proportion of modelled land carbon storage at LGM (28-32%) than at PIH (25%). The agreement between palaeodata and model results for LGM is consistent with the hypothesis that the ecophysiological effects of CO2 influence tree-grass competition and vegetation productivity, and suggests that these effects are also at work today. | ['bartlein', 'harrison', 'prentice'] | ","['bartlein', 'harrison', 'prentice']",3

142,"Grazing impacts and woodland management in Eriksfjord: Betula, coprophilous fungi and the Norse settlement of Greenland | This paper focuses on the impact of Norse settlement on vegetation and landscape around the head of Tunulliarfik (Eriksfjord) in southern Greenland. Pollen, radiocarbon, microscopic charcoal and fungal spore data are presented from a peat monolith which was collected close to the ruins of a large Norse farm complex (group 39 at Qinngua in the former Eastern Settlement). Landnam is identified at ca. cal. a.d. 1020 by a small decrease in pollen from Betula, a slight increase in Poaceae, and the appearance of pollen from Norse apophytes (native plants favoured and spread by human activity) and anthropochores (not native and unintentionally introduced by people). Increases in microscopic charcoal and palynological richness are also apparent. This pattern is broadly consistent with that seen in other pollen diagrams from this region. The sequence is unusual for Greenland, however, in that relatively high Betula pollen percentages (average 20% TLP) are recorded throughout the period of settlement, up to the end of the 14th century a.d. before the profile becomes truncated. If these data are primarily representative of the dry land vegetation, then they suggest that birch woodland and scrub may well have persisted close to the farm throughout the Norse period. Given the potential resource value of woodland to the settlers, this may imply that birch was being managed sustainably, as was the case in Iceland during the medieval period. Coprophilous fungal spores typically found on animal dung are abundant during the early phase of settlement, yet subsequently decline in abundance. This may indicate a likely decrease in grazing intensity or livestock numbers over time, possibly in response to climatic deterioration and/or soil erosion that is expected to have placed increased stress on the pastoral farming system. | ['edward', 'schofield'] | ","['edward', 'schofield']",4
143,"Greenhouse warming and the Eurasian biota: are there any lessons from the past? | Climate models predict a rise in global mean temperature of around 2-4¬∞C by the end of the next century, with far greater rises in the high latitudes. Mean annual temperature rises of 6-8¬∞C are predicted for 65¬∞N, and as much as 10-12¬∞C for above 70¬∞N. There can be little doubt that such changes will have profound effects on boreal and arctic ecosystems, both through the temperature effects themselves and through associated changes in water balance. There is abundant evidence of climatic change in the high latitudes from the last 2.4 million years of the Quaternary. In a succession of glacial-interglacial cycles, high latitude temperatures seem to have fluctuated overall by about the same amount as is projected for the next century. Perhaps it is possible to use our knowledge of such past changes to understand what might happen to the high latitude ecosystems once the future greenhouse warming gets under way? There are many potential pitfalls in using data from the past to attempt to predict the future. In addition to the limitations in the data, there are also many important differences in the rate and setting of changes that should be borne in mind. With regard to climatic time-scale, the biogeographical patterns which we observe for the past are far more likely to represent equilibrium situations than those which we will observe in the future. Equilibrium data can itself be useful in that it provides indications of the distribution of climate conditions towards which the Earth will move. For example, it provides support for the notion that the climatic models are indeed correct in predicting that the strongest warming will occur in the high latitudes. Even following the relatively slow climate changes of the Quaternary high latitudes, there is abundant evidence of disequilibrium in tree species migrations, lasting for millennia in some cases. The survival of nearly all the high-latitude forms of plants and animals known from the Pleistocene fossil record-despite the repeated climatic fluctuations-may provide reassuring evidence of their future resilience. However, the extinctions of many large arctic mammals at around the time of the most recent warming phase may provide warning of what will occur in the future to certain species whose populations are already depleted by human activity. The exceptions to this pattern of gradual change are the sudden climatic shifts which have occurred in the North Atlantic region on several occasions during the late Quaternary. These may offer the closest analogues that we have to the effects of a future greenhouse warming on high-latitude plant and animal communities. It seems that some groups of organisms, such as insects, molluscs and water plants were able to respond rapidly to the climate warming, perhaps on the timescale of decades. However, tree populations were left far behind and took centuries or milennia to catch up with the changed climate, resulting in unfamiliar ecological scenarios in the mid and high latitudes. ¬© 1993. | ['adam', 'borisova', 'branchu', 'faure', 'faure', 'denard', 'velichko', 'zelikson'] | ","['adam', 'borisova', 'branchu', 'faure', 'faure', 'denard', 'velichko', 'zelikson']",3

145,"The historical ecology approach in species conservation - Identifying suitable habitat management for the endangered clouded Apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne L.) in Sweden | A core task in biodiversity conservation is to protect and restore populations of endangered species. The analysis of causes of decline based on data sampled in declining populations in sub-optimal habitats risks overlooking necessary environmental factors because they are no longer present at the sites. It may therefore be necessary to search for conditions that were present before the species began to decline. We used an historical ecology approach to identify critical ecological needs for the endangered butterfly Clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne, in Sweden in relation to historical and current land use. The most suitable habitat structure and management was transformed into a plan for restoration and management, applied at two P. mnemosyne sites. The populations of P. mnemosyne and its host-plant, Corydalis solida, were monitored annually 2004-2014. Based on previous knowledge about P. mnemosyne, the Swedish plan for conservation of the species recommends regular clearings of shrubs and trees in order to maintain a mosaic tree-grassland habitat, and a limited of removal of ground biomass. Our analysis suggested an alternative management approach, late and rather intense grazing. The populations of P. mnemosyne and its host plant increased in response to this management regime and the butterfly started dispersing to new sites. We suggest a structured method for combining ecological and historical knowledge, which can reveal habitat conditions difficult to detect in the field today, but that are of crucial importance for successful species conservation. | ['bjorklund', 'lennartsson', 'westin'] | ","['bjorklund', 'lennartsson', 'westin']",0
146,"Historical variability of subfossil chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) in three lakes impacted by natural and anthropogenic disturbances | In the eastern boreal forest of Quebec, Canada, harvesting strategies try to mimic the effects of fire on forest ecosystems, assuming that both disturbances have similar impacts. However impacts of both types of perturbations on lacustrine ecosystems, especially on chironomids (non-biting midges), are still poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine if logging and fire resulted in chironomid assemblages significantly different than pre-disturbance states and to see if the harvesting strategy (careful logging around advanced growth (CLAAG) and buffer zones) protect lakes from logging effects in the boreal forest. Three statistical tests were used to study the difference between pre- and post-disturbance assemblages: a principal component analysis (PCA), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and a non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) ordination. All statistical analyses suggested that fire did not have any effects on chironomid assemblages. The PCA analysis showed that two logging events in Lac aux Huards created chironomid assemblages slightly outside the pre-disturbance variability. However, ANOSIM showed that these differences were not significant at the 0.5% level of significance. These results suggest that the presence of a buffer zone probably limited the impacts of logging on lakes in this area. | ['larocque', 'tobler', 'sirois', 'tremblay'] | ","['larocque', 'tobler', 'sirois', 'tremblay']",3

Nevertheless, mercury in industrial emissions and its long-range transport and deposition in Scandinavia still pose a threat, especially to fauna which feed on aquatic organisms. The article primarily describes research regarding levels of mercury in Swedish fauna and flora, with a concentration on higher animals. Particular emphasis is laid on the increase of levels from the 19th century to the present (the last 150 years) caused by increased industrial activity.

148,"Hotspots of biotic compositional change in lakes along vast latitudinal transects in northern Canada | Ecotones mark zones of rapid change in ecological structure at various spatial scales. They are believed to be particularly susceptible to shifts caused by environmental transformation, making them key regions for studying the effects of global change. Here, we explored the variation in assemblage structure of aquatic primary producer and consumer communities across latitudinal transects in northeastern North America (Quebec-Labrador) to identify spatial patterns in biodiversity that indicated the location of transition zones across the landscape. We analyzed species richness and the cumulative rate of compositional change (expressed as beta-diversity) of diatoms and chironomids to detect any abrupt shifts in the rate of spatial taxonomic turnover. We used principal coordinates analysis to estimate community turnover with latitude, then applied piecewise linear regression to assess the position of ecotones. Statistically significant changes in assemblage composition occurred at 52 and 55 degrees N, corresponding to the transition between closed- and open-crown forest, and to the southern onset of the forest tundra (i.e., the forest limit), respectively. The spatial distribution of ecotones was most strongly related to air temperature for chironomids and to vegetation- and soil-related chemical attributes of lake water for diatoms, including dissolved organic carbon content and water color. Lakes at mid- to high-latitudes currently face pressures from rapidly rising temperatures, accompanied by large increases in organic carbon inputs from their catchments, often leading to browning and its associated effects. The biota at the base of food webs in lakes located in transition zones are disproportionately affected by the cascading effects of these multi-factorial changes, concurrent with pronounced terrestrial greening observed in these regions. Similar patterns of biotic shifts have been observed along alpine aquatic transects, indicating the potential for widespread restructuring of cold, high-altitude and high-latitude freshwater communities due to global change. | ['antoniades', 'pienitz', 'saulnier', 'talbot'] | ","['antoniades', 'pienitz', 'saulnier', 'talbot']",1
149,"Human-vegetation interactions during the Holocene in North America | Between the initial colonization of North America and the European settlement period, Indigenous American land use practices shaped North American landscapes and ecosystems, but a critical question is the extent of these impacts on the land, and how these influenced the distributions of the flora and fauna. The present study addresses this question by estimating the spatial correlation between continental-scale records of fossil pollen and archaeological radiocarbon data, and provides a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal relationship between palaeo-populations and ten important North American pollen taxa. Maps of Indigenous American population density, based on the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database, are compared to maps of plant abundance as estimated by pollen records from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, using nonparametric kernel estimators and cross-correlation techniques. Periods of high spatial cross-correlation (either positive or negative) between population density and plant abundance were identified, but these associations were intermittent and did not increase towards the present. In many cases, high values of population density corresponded with high values of a particular taxon in one region, but simultaneously corresponded with low values in other regions, lessening the overall correlation between the two fields. This analysis suggests that human impacts were not significant enough to be identified at a continental scale, either due to low population numbers or land use, implying significant impacts of ancient human activities on the vegetation were regional rather than continental. | ['chaput', 'gajewski', 'kriesche', 'kulik', 'schmidt'] | ","['chaput', 'gajewski', 'kriesche', 'kulik', 'schmidt']",1
150,"Humic fingerprinting of soil organic matter as a proxy for palaeo-reconstruction | The composition of soil organic matter is evaluated as a proxy for environmental change in soil memory records using analytic pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS). Thirty-four soil samples of Ah horizons of different ecosystems at different locations in West Siberia, Poland, Belgium, Nebraska (USA), Tanzania and Peru were analysed using py-GC/MS. Data obtained were analysed using multivariate factor analysis and indicator species analysis, which showed general relationships between humic composition and vegetation type. Within temperate biomes, a difference in soil organic matter of sites with different soil texture was most prominent. The Rocourt soil in the Vandersanden Quarry in Veldwezelt (Belgian Pleistocene loess belt) was selected as a case study on the use of humic fingerprinting. The humiferous complex of Remicourt (HCR) was analysed by py-GC/MS. The dark band at the base of the HCR clearly differed in humic composition compared to the lighter band on top. It had the highest levels of levoglucosan and contained mainly strongly decomposed components. This suggests a soil layer that was at the surface for a long period of time. This layer also had higher levels of C and N, and a higher C/N than overlying layers. Samples higher in the profile contain less levoglucosan and humic compounds become less degraded. A stable soil surface was overlaid by a horizon formed under colder and more arid conditions. A remarkable humic fingerprint was obtained from a sample just below the top of the HCR which contains large amounts of stable aromatic compounds and poly-aromatic compounds known as charcoal derivatives. The Veldwezelt case study yielded valuable indications about former climate and vegetation, although the link with soil organic matter components of current ecosystems was not established. | ['caus', 'decker', 'dudal', 'gullentops', 'swennen', 'vancampenhout', 'vos', 'wouters'] | ","['caus', 'decker', 'dudal', 'gullentops', 'swennen', 'vancampenhout', 'vos', 'wouters']",4
151,"Impacts of climate, tephra and land use upon Holocene landscape stability in Northwest Iceland | Climate, land use and tephra deposition are the primary drivers of environmental change in Iceland. Understanding the roles of these factors in the formation of the current Icelandic landscape requires an examination of environmental change over wide temporal and spatial scales. Using sediments from two lakes, each spanning the last 10,300 years, this study presents evidence of the effects of climate, volcanism and human settlement on the environment in the highland margin and in lowland areas in Northwest Iceland during the Holocene. The results show that sedimentary processes in the lakes have been primarily driven by the different geographical settings in lowland and highland areas. The impacts of Holocene climate change on the environment were identified in both lake records by distinct variations in both physical and chemical proxies. The lacustrine sedimentary records from Hafratjorn and Baroalaekjartjorn highlight the important relationship between vegetation cover and landscape resilience to two of the most voluminous tephra deposits of the Holocene: Hekla 4 and Hekla 3. The detrimental human impact on landscape stability is marked in the lake records by an increase in minerogenic material and by elevated C/N ratios in the sediment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

152,"The impact of using different modern climate data sets in pollen-based paleoclimate reconstructions of North America | The use of different modern climate data sets is shown to impact a continental-scale pollen-based reconstruction of mean July temperature (TJUL) over the last 2000 years for North America. Data from climate stations, physically modeled from climate stations and reanalysis products are used to calibrate the reconstructions. Results show that the use of reanalysis products produces warmer and/or smoother reconstructions as compared to the use of station based data sets. The reconstructions during the period of 1050-1550 CE are shown to be more variable because of a high latitude cold-bias in the modern TJUL data. The ultra-high resolution WorldClim gridded data may only useful if the modern pollen sites have at least the same spatial precision as the gridded dataset.

153,"Impacts of Norse settlement on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Southwest Iceland | Norse colonization of North Atlantic islands in the 1st millennium of the Common Era led to drastic prehistoric environmental changes in these previously ""pristine"" landscapes. In Iceland, Norse settlement is associated with a rapid decline in birch trees and heightened soil erosion, yet the timing of Norse exploration in the North Atlantic coincided with large climate changes that also influenced Icelandic environments. To date, there are few records that disentangle climatic and human impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, and there has been very little work on the impacts of Norse arrival on Iceland's aquatic ecosystems. Here we use a high-resolution lake-sediment record from Vestra Gislholtsvatn (VGHV), southwest Iceland to investigate these processes during the last 2,000 years. Norse arrival (c. 870 CE) in Iceland is followed by a rapid increase in sedimentation rate and a transition in leaf wax n-alkanes indicating a decrease in trees and expansion of grasses. This transition coincides with limnological changes, including increased primary productivity (i.e. C(17)n-alkane and biogenic opal fluxes) and shifts in the haptophyte algal community. Many of these changes are still apparent today. Comparisons with a new winter-spring alkenone temperature reconstruction from VGHV and marine sea surface temperature records show little to no correlation between terrestrial and aquatic ecological changes and climate at this time. Similarly, volcanic eruptions recorded in VGHV are not associated with any long-term environmental changes. Rather, the VGHV record suggests that human settlement had a lasting impact on the catchment area of VGHV and changes within the lake ecosystem. | ['garfinkel', 'huang', 'richter', 'russell'] | ","['garfinkel', 'huang', 'richter', 'russell']",3
154,"Impacts of a recent storm surge on an Arctic delta ecosystem examined in the context of the last millennium | One of the most ominous predictions related to recent climatic warming is that low-lying coastal environments will be inundated by higher sea levels. The threat is especially acute in polar regions because reductions in extent and duration of sea ice cover increase the risk of storm surge occurrence. The Mackenzie Delta of northwest Canada is an ecologically significant ecosystem adapted to freshwater flooding during spring breakup. Marine storm surges during the open-water season, which move saltwater into the delta, can have major impacts on terrestrial and aquatic systems. We examined growth rings of alder shrubs (Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa) and diatoms preserved in dated lake sediment cores to show that a recent marine storm surge in 1999 caused widespread ecological changes across a broad extent of the outer Mackenzie Delta. For example, diatom assemblages record a striking shift from freshwater to brackish species following the inundation event. What is of particular significance is that the magnitude of this recent ecological impact is unmatched over the >1,000-year history of this lake ecosystem. We infer that no biological recovery has occurred in this lake, while large areas of terrestrial vegetation remain dramatically altered over a decade later, suggesting that these systems may be on a new ecological trajectory. As climate continues to warm and sea ice declines, similar changes will likely be repeated in other coastal areas of the circumpolar Arctic. Given the magnitude of ecological changes recorded in this study, such impacts may prove to be long lasting or possibly irreversible. | ['kokelj', 'lantz', 'nesbitt', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'solomon', 'thienpont'] | ","['kokelj', 'lantz', 'nesbitt', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'solomon', 'thienpont']",4
155,"What are the impacts of reindeer/caribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) on arctic and alpine vegetation? A systematic review | Background: The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus L.) has a natural range extending over much of Eurasia's and North America's arctic, alpine and boreal zones, yet its impact on vegetation is still unclear. This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Methods: Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results: Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. Conclusions: We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood. | ['berne', 'brathen', 'forbes', 'moen', 'speed'] | ","['berne', 'brathen', 'forbes', 'moen', 'speed']",3
156,"Importance of cryoturbation in redistributing organic carbon in permafrost-affected soils | This Study examined the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) incorporated by cryoturbation into the active layer and nearsurface permafrost of Turbels from northern Alaska. An analysis of 21 pedons revealed that an average of 55% of the SOC density of the active layer and near-surface permafrost could be attributed to redistribution from cryoturbation. Cryoturbation occurs most strongly under conditions of poor drainage, where the parent materials are enriched in silt, and where frost boils are present. Based on published radiocarbon dates of buried SOC, cryoturbation was particularly important during periods of the mid-Holocene when the arctic underwent warming. These results suggest that continued warming of the arctic could accelerate cryoturbation and enable the soil to store more SOC than at present, thereby mitigating some of the loss of CO2 to the atmosphere from increased soil respiration. | ['bockheim'] | ",['bockheim'],3
157,"Imprint of Climate Change on Pan-Arctic Marine Vegetation | The Arctic climate is changing rapidly. The warming and resultant longer open water periods suggest a potential for expansion of marine vegetation along the vast Arctic coastline. We compiled and reviewed the scattered time series on Arctic marine vegetation and explored trends for macroalgae and eelgrass (Zostera marina). We identified a total of 38 sites, distributed between Arctic coastal regions in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway/Svalbard, and Russia, having time series extending into the 21st Century. The majority of these exhibited increase in abundance, productivity or species richness, and/or expansion of geographical distribution limits, several time series showed no significant trend. Only four time series displayed a negative trend, largely due to urchin grazing or increased turbidity. Overall, the observations support with medium confidence (i.e., 5‚Äì8 in 10 chance of being correct, adopting the IPCC confidence scale) the prediction that macrophytes are expanding in the Arctic. Species distribution modeling was challenged by limited observations and lack of information on substrate, but suggested a current (2000‚Äì2017) potential pan-Arctic macroalgal distribution area of 820.000 km2 (145.000 km2 intertidal, 675.000 km2 subtidal), representing an increase of about 30% for subtidal- and 6% for intertidal macroalgae since 1940‚Äì1950, and associated polar migration rates averaging 18‚Äì23 km decade‚Äì1. Adjusting the potential macroalgal distribution area by the fraction of shores represented by cliffs halves the estimate (412,634 km2). Warming and reduced sea ice cover along the Arctic coastlines are expected to stimulate further expansion of marine vegetation from boreal latitudes. The changes likely affect the functioning of coastal Arctic ecosystems because of the vegetation‚Äôs roles as habitat, and for carbon and nutrient cycling and storage. We encourage a pan-Arctic science- and management agenda to incorporate marine vegetation into a coherent understanding of Arctic changes by quantifying distribution and status beyond the scattered studies now available to develop sustainable management strategies for these important ecosystems. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2020 Krause-Jensen, Archambault, Assis, Bartsch, Bischof, Filbee-Dexter, Dunton, Maximova, Ragnarsd√≥ttir, Sejr, Simakova, Spiridonov, Wegeberg, Winding and Duarte. | ['archambault', 'assis', 'bartsch', 'bischof', 'duarte', 'dunton', 'filbee', 'dexter', 'krause', 'jensen', 'maximova', 'ragnarsd√≥ttir', 'sejr', 'simakova', 'spiridonov', 'wegeberg', 'winding'] | ","['archambault', 'assis', 'bartsch', 'bischof', 'duarte', 'dunton', 'filbee', 'dexter', 'krause', 'jensen', 'maximova', 'ragnarsd√≥ttir', 'sejr', 'simakova', 'spiridonov', 'wegeberg', 'winding']",4
158,"Increasing Contaminant Burdens in an Arctic Fish, Burbot (Lota lota), in a Warming Climate | The temporal patterns of mercury (Hg), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and other contaminants in Arctic aquatic biota are usually attributed to changing atmospheric sources. However, climate variability and change is another means of altering contaminant fate and bioavailability. We show here that the concentrations of Hg and PCBs in Mackenzie River burbot (Lota Iota), a top predator fish and important staple food for northern Canadian communities, have increased significantly over the last 25 years despite falling or stable atmospheric concentrations, suggesting that environmental processes subsequent to atmospheric transport are responsible. Using a dated sediment core from a tributary lake near the Mackenzie River sampling site, we show that variations in Hg concentrations downcore are strongly associated with labile, algal-derived organic matter (OM). Strong temporal correlations between increasing primary productivity and biotic Hg and PCBs as reflected by burbot suggest that warming temperatures and reduced ice cover may lead to increased exposure to these contaminants in high trophic level Arctic freshwater biota. | ['carrie', 'macdonald', 'outridge', 'sanei', 'stern', 'wang'] | ","['carrie', 'macdonald', 'outridge', 'sanei', 'stern', 'wang']",0

Other climate-related variables that can be tracked include dissolved organic carbon concentrations that can be related to past changes in arctic treeline, and past ice-cover in high-arctic regions. | ['cumming', 'douglas', 'pienitz', 'smol'] | ","['cumming', 'douglas', 'pienitz', 'smol']",0
160,"Influence of atmospheric internal variability on the long-term Siberian water cycle during the past 2 centuries | River discharges from Siberia are a large source of freshwater into the Arctic Ocean, whereas the cause of the long-term variation in Siberian discharges is still unclear. The observed river discharges of the Lena in the east and the Ob in the west indicated different relationships in each of the epochs during the past 7 decades. The correlations between the two river discharges were negative during the 1980s to mid-1990s, positive during the mid-1950s to 1960s, and became weak after the mid-1990s. More long-term records of tree-ring-reconstructed discharges have also shown differences in the correlations in each of the epochs. It is noteworthy that the correlations obtained from the reconstructions tend to be negative during the past 2 centuries. Such tendency has also been obtained from precipitations in observations, and in simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) and fully coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs conducted for the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC. The AGCM control simulation further demonstrated that an east-west seesaw pattern of summertime large-scale atmospheric circulation frequently emerges over Siberia as an atmospheric internal variability. This results in an opposite anomaly of precipitation over the Lena and Ob and the negative correlation. Consequently, the summertime atmospheric internal variability in the east-west seesaw pattern over Siberia is a key factor influencing the long-term variation in precipitation and river discharge, i.e., the water cycle in this region. | ['ogata', 'oshima', 'park', 'tachibana'] | ","['ogata', 'oshima', 'park', 'tachibana']",3
161,"Influence of Hydrological Conditions on the Formation of Forested Peatlands and Shallow-Peat Forests at Watersheds in the Central Forest Nature Reserve | The spatial variability of the water regime determined by peat-deposit structure and surface slope is characteristic of watershed forested peatlands and shallow-peat forests that belong to similar forest types The specific features of the water regime determine the tree-stand structure, the composition of the herb-shrub and moss tiers, and the reaction to climatic changes of the past. The history of forested peatlands formation is comparable in duration to that of large peatbog massifs formation. An increase in wood-macrofossils content in peat is characteristic of warm periods of the Holocene. Conversely, a decrease in wood-macrofossils content accompanied by an increase in sphagnum moss remains, intensive growth of the deposit, and paludification of the adjacent forests were timed to the cold periods. The climatic factor was shown to determine the general direction of forested peatlands development, whereas the hydrological features of the site determined the variety of scenarios and resistance to environmental changes. | ['glushkov', 'minayeva', 'sirin'] | ","['glushkov', 'minayeva', 'sirin']",1
162,"On the influence of land cover on early Holocene climate in northern latitudes | [1] This study presents a factorial experimental strategy for assessing the effects of the changing land surface on early Holocene (similar to 11 ka) climate in Beringia. The strategy uses a coupled land-atmosphere single column model in a series of perturbation experiments that vary the vegetation type, lake cover, and soil specification simultaneously. Two sites and eight years of model forcing are chosen to determine the importance of differing terrestrial histories, local climate, and interannual variability. Eastern Beringia is represented by Fairbanks, Alaska, and western Beringia is represented by Elikchan Lake, Siberia. Evaluations of model response are performed using metrics important for vegetation growth, such as growing degree days and moisture availability. For both sites, large-scale interannual variability has a greater impact on the local climate than changes in the land surface specification for temperature-based responses, but not for moisture availability. Of the three land surface parameters tested, vegetation type is most influential. Vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest leads to increased precipitation, winter snow depth, and low cloud, leading to a delayed snowmelt in forested regions. This is in contrast to expectations based on albedo arguments alone. In western Beringia, a positive feedback is suggested in warming due to the presence of boreal forest, consistent with some observations that Siberian deciduous forest persisted longer than Alaskan deciduous forest in the context of large-scale cooling of the climate. The reverse was found to be true in eastern Beringia, where deciduous forests exhibited a cooling effect due to increases in albedo. The response to soil variations was relatively small, but the inclusion of inland lakes tends in general to cool the surface, although in some years a warming is evident due to the surface energy balance shifting in favor of downwelling longwave heating over evaporative cooling. | ['lynch', 'river'] | ","['lynch', 'river']",0
163,"Influence of the physical terrestrial Arctic in the eco-climate system | This synthesis paper provides a summary of the major components of the physical terrestrial Arctic and the influences of their changes upon the larger eco-climate system. Foci here are snow cover, permafrost, and land hydrology. During the last century, snow cover duration has shortened in a large portion of the circum-Arctic, mainly because of its early northward retreat in spring due to warming. Winter precipitation has generally increased, resulting in an increase in maximum snow depth over large areas. This is consistent with the increase in river discharge over large Russian watersheds. Soil temperature has also increased, and the active layer has deepened in most of the permafrost regions, whereas thinning of the seasonally frozen layer has been observed in areas not underlain by permafrost. These active components are mutually interrelated, conditioned by ambient micro- to landscape-level topography and local surface and subsurface conditions, and they are closely related with vegetation and ecology, as evidenced by evolution in the late Quaternary. Further, we provide examples and arguments for discussions on the pathways through which changes in the Arctic terrestrial system can affect or propagate to remote areas beyond the Arctic, reaching to the extratropics in the larger climate system. These considerations include dynamical and thermodynamical responses and feedbacks, modification of hemisphere-scale atmospheric circulation associated with troposphere-stratosphere couplings, and moisture intrusion at a continental scale. | ['barry', 'hinzman', 'marchenko', 'romanovsky', 'saito', 'yang', 'zhang'] | ","['barry', 'hinzman', 'marchenko', 'romanovsky', 'saito', 'yang', 'zhang']",3
164,"The influence of Holocene tree-line advance and retreat on an arctic lake ecosystem: a multi-proxy study from Kharinei Lake, North Eastern European Russia | A consequence of predicted climate warming will be tree-line advance over large areas of the Russian tundra. Palaeolimnological techniques can be used to provide analogues of how such changes in tree-line advance and subsequent retreat affected lake ecosystems in the past. A Holocene sediment core taken from Kharinei Lake (Russia) was dated radiometrically and used for multi-proxy analyses with the aim of determining how climate and tree-line dynamics affected the productivity, community structure, carbon cycling and light regime in the lake. Pollen and macrofossil analyses were used to determine the dates of the arrival and retreat of birch and spruce forest. C:N ratios and percent loss-on-ignition were used to infer past changes in sediment organic matter. Visible-near-infrared spectroscopy and diatom analysis were used to infer past changes in lake-water carbon. Algal pigments and aquatic macrophytes were used to determine changes in lake productivity and light. Chironomids together with remains of the aquatic flora and fauna were used to provide information on past July temperature and continentality. Lake sedimentation was initiated shortly before 11,000 cal. years BP, when both chironomid- and pollen-inferred temperature reconstructions suggest higher summer temperatures than present, between 1 and 2 degrees C warmer, and lake productivity was relatively high. A few trees were already present at this time. The spruce forest expanded at 8,000 cal. year BP remaining in the vicinity of the lake until 3,500 cal. year BP. This period coincided with a high concentration of organic material in the water column, and relatively high benthic productivity, as indicated by a high benthic: planktonic diatom ratio. After tree-line retreat, the optical transparency of the lake increased, and it became more open and exposed, and was thus subject to greater water-column mixing resulting in a higher abundance of diatom phytoplankton, especially heavily silicified Aulocoseira species. The colder climate resulted in a shorter ice-free period, the lake was less productive and there was a loss of aquatic macrophytes. Increased wind-induced mixing following forest retreat had a greater influence on the lake ecosystem than the effects of decreasing organic matter concentration and increased light penetration. | ['brook', 'jones', 'mcgowan', 'parrott', 'rosen', 'salonen', 'self', 'seppa', 'solovieva', 'valiranta'] | ","['brook', 'jones', 'mcgowan', 'parrott', 'rosen', 'salonen', 'self', 'seppa', 'solovieva', 'valiranta']",3
165,"Initial recruitment and establishment of vascular plants in relation to topographical variation in microsite conditions on a recently-deglaciated moraine on Ellesmere Island, high arctic Canada | We investigated the effects of topographical positions (moraine ridge, upper side slope and lower side slope) within a recently-deglaciated young moraine on initial recruitment and establishment of vascular plants. Compared with the moraine ridge, the upper slope had similar/higher abundance of vascular plants in terms of percent cover, frequency occurrence, species number, and density/biomass of a dominating species, Salix arctica. Establishment and growth of vascular plants are generally inhibited on unstable habitats; nevertheless, on this newly-formed moraine, every attribute measured for vascular plants implied a higher probability of vascular plant recruitment on the upper slope, where substrate is less stable than on the ridge. Further, the microsite with greater vascular plant abundance, S. arctica density and S. arctica aboveground/leaf biomass accumulated more organic materials regardless of topographical positions, and such an organic accumulation was deepest on the upper slope, suggesting that relatively-successful plant establishment occurs on this site. This is further supported by the S. arctica population structure, which implies a relatively-constant juvenile supply on the upper slope. Along a slope, unstable gravels easily slide down hill. This topographical process may cause large rock size and high surface cover by rocks on the lower slope. On the upper slope, the percent cover by rocks had therefore become smaller, leading to high cover by fine-grained sediments, which retain moisture favorable for germination and growth of vascular plants. This would enhance the emergence of pioneer vascular plant species, probably resulting in higher vascular plant abundance, density and biomass of S. arctica on the upper slope. This study suggests that during primary succession following deglaciation in the high arctic the upper slope of a newly-formed glacier moraine may be an important location for the initial recruitment and establishment of pioneer vascular plant species, such as S. arctica. | ['iwasaki', 'kanda', 'mori', 'osono', 'uchida'] | ","['iwasaki', 'kanda', 'mori', 'osono', 'uchida']",0
166,"Insights and issues with estimating northern peatland carbon stocks and fluxes since the Last Glacial Maximum | In this review paper, we identify and address key uncertainties related to four local and global controls of Holocene northern peatland carbon stocks and fluxes. First, we provide up-to-date estimates of the current northern peatland area (3.2¬†M¬†km2) and propose a novel approach to reconstruct changes in the northern peatland area over time (Section 2). Second, we review the key methods and models that have been used to quantify total carbon stocks and methane emissions over time at the hemispheric scale, and offer new research directions to improve these calculations (Section 3). Our main proposed improvement relates to allocating different carbon stock and emission values for each of the two dominant vegetation assemblages (sedge and brown moss-dominated vs. Sphagnum-dominated peat). Third, we discuss and quantify the importance of basin heterogeneity in estimating peat volume at the local scale (Section 4.1). We also highlight the importance of age model selection when reconstructing carbon accumulation rates from a peat core (Section 4.2). Lastly, we introduce the role of biogeomorphological agents such as beaver activity in controlling carbon dynamics (Section 5.1) and review the newest research related to permafrost thaw (Section 5.2) and peat fire (Section 5.3) under climate change. Overall, this review summarizes new information from a broad range of peat-carbon studies, provides novel analysis of hemispheric-scale paleo datasets, and proposes new insights on how to translate peat-core data into carbon fluxes. It also identifies critical data gaps and research priorities, and many ways to consider and address them. ¬© 2016 Elsevier B.V. | ['holmquist', 'hugelius', 'karran', 'loisel', 'nichols', 'pelletier', 'talbot', 'yu', 'van', 'bellen'] | ","['holmquist', 'hugelius', 'karran', 'loisel', 'nichols', 'pelletier', 'talbot', 'yu', 'van', 'bellen']",3
167,"Integration of modern and past pollen accumulation rate (PAR) records across the arctic tree-line: a method for more precise vegetation reconstructions | In order to assess the potential role of the boreal forest in the early to mid-Holocene global dynamics, it is critical that the tree-line reconstructions are based on precise palacorecords. Pollen accumulation rate (PAR) calculations provide a technique for estimating past plant population densities independently for each species. When considering tree-lines, an important concept is the threshold PAR value for the absence, presence, and dominance of the most common tree species. Such threshold values are often based on modern take sediment core-top PAR values. In northern Fermoscandia, records obtained through pollen monitoring now add an important element to these studies, as they allow more precise definitions of the temporal and spatial limits of PAR values. Here we compare modern PAR values based on pollen monitoring data with sediment core-top data to evaluate the robustness of the threshold values for the major tree species of Finnish Lapland. We apply these threshold values to two fossil PAR records from this tree-line region and, as an example of the potential of the approach, map the vegetation patterns in the area at 7000 cal yr BP. The results indicate that the extent of the mid-Holocene tree-line advance in northern Fermoscandia was substantially less than climate-vegetation model simulations have predicted. Despite their value and potential in vegetation reconstructions, the use of PAR values requires careful validation of the data. We stress the importance of basin size, of precise and reliable sediment dating, age-depth modelling, and assessment of the sedimentary processes in each study basin as prerequisites for PAR-based studies.

168,"Should we further investigate the cascading effects of introduced fish on insectivorous birds? | We investigated whether the introduction of fish (brown trout, Salm degrees trutta) in previously fishless boreal lakes could alter the aquatic insect subsidy and affect the nesting population of insectivorous migratoiy birds, with a particular focus on the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, which is the most represented species. According to our paleolimnological data and bioenergetic model, introduced trout increased the adult midge biomass output from 18.6 to 28.7 kg (+54.6%), which was energetically significant and could have theoretically supported an increase in insectivorous birds nesting around the lake. While the long-term series of insectivorous birds nesting around the lake seemed to increase according to the modeled fish effects. we could not establish a clear link with changes in food availability. Our control (pied flycatchers) showed similar patterns as our treatment, suggesting that this species' abundance was affected by factors other than fish presence in the lake. The demographic fluctuations and trends of the pied flycatcher at the regional scale seemed to override cascading effects linking introduced fish, emerging midges, and insectivorous birds. We conclude that further studies will be needed to investigate this topic and propose some areas for future research. | ['milardi', 'petaja', 'weckstrom'] | ","['milardi', 'petaja', 'weckstrom']",3
169,"Key periods of peatland development and environmental changes in the middle taiga zone of Western Siberia during the Holocene | The response of peatlands to climate change can be highly variable. Through understanding past changes we can better predict the response of peatlands to future climate change. We use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the surface wetness and carbon accumulation of the Mukhrino mire (Western Siberia), describing the development of the mire since peat formation in the early Holocene, around 9360 cal. year BP. The mire started as a rich fen which initiated after paludification of a spruce forest (probably in response to a wetter climate), while the Mukhrino mire progressed to ombrotrophic bog conditions (8760 cal. year BP). This transition coincided with the intensive development of mires in Western Siberia and was associated with active carbon accumulation (31 g m(-2) year(-1)). The ecosystem underwent a change to a tree-covered state around 5860 cal. year BP, likely in response to warming and possible droughts and this accompanied low carbon accumulation (12 g m(2) year(-1)). If the future climate will be warmer and wetter, then regional mires are likely to remain a carbon sink, alternatively, a reversion to the wooded state with reduced carbon sink strength is possible. | ['babeshko', 'fatyunina', 'kulkov', 'lapshina', 'mazei', 'payne', 'ratcliffe', 'tsyganov', 'yushkovets', 'zarov', 'zazovskaya'] | ","['babeshko', 'fatyunina', 'kulkov', 'lapshina', 'mazei', 'payne', 'ratcliffe', 'tsyganov', 'yushkovets', 'zarov', 'zazovskaya']",0
170,"Knowledge from the ancient sea - a long-term perspective of human impact on aquatic life in Mesolithic Scandinavia | Lately, evidence for early-Holocene emerging sedentism has been suggested among foragers in Northern Europe. The core of this suggested sedentism lies in the increasing dependency on large-scale fishing and mass consumption of fish and a territorial behaviour associated with access to the best fishing locations. This territoriality might also be associated with increasing numbers of people settling and living in Northern Europe at this time. In this article, we review the evidence for forager sedentism and territoriality and relate it to large-scale fishing, during a time of global warming, in early-Holocene Scandinavia. We explore the requisites of using the archaeological record to study the long-term effect of intense fishing on some of the best-preserved Stone Age sites in the area of study. We suggest that the archaeological record can enable a discussion of how aquatic life varies corresponding to human exploitation and climate change. In addition, we discuss how these changes might be traceable through temporal fluctuations in species composition, within species size reduction/increases, temporal fish age changes and within species dietary changes. In the end, we suggest that the archaeological record holds one of the keys to predict future impact on life below the surface, by offering a long-term perspective on aquatic exploitation in a period of climate change. At the same time as we acknowledge the potential hidden in the archaeological record, we also raise the dire warning that this record might be rapidly disappearing, because of an accelerated deterioration of archaeological organic remains in areas previously known for their good preservation. | ['bergsvik', 'boethius', 'nilsson'] | ","['bergsvik', 'boethius', 'nilsson']",3
171,"Lake Ecosystem Responses to Holocene Climate Change at the Subarctic Tree-Line in Northern Sweden | A Holocene sediment sequence from Lake Seukokjaure, a subarctic lake at tree-line in northern Sweden, was analyzed to assess major changes in the structure and functioning of the aquatic ecosystem in response to climate change and tree-line dynamics. The compiled multi-proxy data, including sedimentary pigments, diatoms, chironomids, pollen, biogenic silica (BSi), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) elemental and stable-isotope records, and total lake-water organic carbon (TOC) concentration inferred from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), suggest that the Holocene development of Lake Seukokjaure was closely coupled to changes in terrestrial vegetation with associated soil development of the catchment, input of allochthonous organic carbon, and changes in the light regime of the lake. A relatively productive state just after deglaciation around 9700 to 7800 cal years BP was followed by a slight long-term decrease in primary production. The onset of the local tree-line retreat around 3200 cal years BP was accompanied by more diverse and altered chironomid and diatom assemblages and indications of destabilized soils in the catchment by an increase in variability and absolute values of delta C-13. An abrupt drop in the C/N ratio around 1750 cal years BP was coupled to changes in the internal lake structure, in combination with changes in light and nutrient conditions, resulting in a shift in the phototrophic community from diatom dominance to increased influence of chlorophytes, likely dominated by an aquatic moss community. Thus, this study emphasizes the importance of indirect effects of climate change on tree-line lake ecosystems and complex interactions of in-lake processes during the Holocene. | ['eriksson', 'hammarlund', 'reuss', 'rosen', 'rundgren', 'segerstrom'] | ","['eriksson', 'hammarlund', 'reuss', 'rosen', 'rundgren', 'segerstrom']",3
172,"Holocene lake sediment records of Arctic hydrology | Although paleoclimatic research in the Arctic has most often focused on variations in temperature, the Arctic has also experienced changes in hydrologic balance. Changes in Arctic precipitation and evaporation rates affects soils, permafrost, lakes, wetlands, rivers, ice and vegetation. Changes in Arctic soils, permafrost, runoff, and vegetation can influence global climate by changing atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide concentrations, thermohaline circulation, and high latitude albedo. Documenting past variations in Arctic hydrological conditions is important for understanding Arctic climate and the potential response and role of the Arctic in regards to future climate change. Methods for reconstructing past changes in Arctic hydrology from the stratigraphic, isotopic, geochemical and fossil records of lake sediments are being developed, refined and applied in a number of regions. These records suggest that hydrological variations in the Arctic have been regionally asynchronous, reflecting the impacts of different forcing factors including orbitally controlled insolation changes, changes in geography related to coastal emergence, ocean currents, sea ice extent, and atmospheric circulation. Despite considerable progress, much work remains to be done on the development of paleohydrological proxies and their application to the Arctic. | ['felzer', 'finney', 'forman', 'macdonald'] | ","['felzer', 'finney', 'forman', 'macdonald']",1
173,"Holocene land degradation and climatic change in northeastern Iceland | The spatial and temporal pattern of land degradation in northeastern Iceland during the Holocene was analysed in relation to climatic fluctuations. Tephrochronology was used to date the inferred terrestrial changes, and remote sensing and geographical information systems to assess the dynamic relationships between topographic relief, geomorphic processes and soil structure. Changes in vegetation and soil cover during the Holocene were found to be more dynamic than previously reported, highlighted by three substantial degradation phases, two of which occurred prior to the recorded Viking settlement in the ninth century AD, approximately 5000 BP and approximately 2500 BP. The results demonstrate the role of climate in modifying land cover, hence triggering land degradation without anthropogenic influence. However, anthropogenic activity probably had a significant role in the acceleration of the third degradation phase in the sixteenth century AD, when the system was possibly forced beyond its threshold of recovery, resulting in land degradation on a catastrophic scale. | ['gudmundsson', 'olafsdottir'] | ","['gudmundsson', 'olafsdottir']",1
174,"Landscape Geochemistry - Retrospect and Prospect - 1990 | At present, the terms Environmental Geochemistry and Applied Geochemistry are poorly defined in English. In fact they usually mean just what a particular geochemist, or geochemist(s), wishes them to mean. There is a less common term, Landscape Geochemistry, which describes a holistic scientific discipline aimed at the geochemistry of the environment. Although little known outside the U.S.S.R., the basics of landscape geochemistry were first described more than 60 a ago. Since then, landscape geochemistry has had a history pertinent to all scientists who participate in environmental geochemistry today. This review traces the evolution of landscape geochemistry, and related disciplines, over the past 90 a and shows how they all relate to the development of modern environmental geochemistry worldwide. In landscape geochemistry, the term ""landscape"" refers to both the horizontal stratification of land (e.g. into terrestial, bog and aquatic ecosystems which co-exist in an area of country) and to the vertical stratification within these units (e.g. into vegetation, soils etc.). In these respects landscape geochemistry resembles Landscape Ecology, which is currently a discipline of growing importance in environmental science. Landscape geochemistry differs from landscape ecology because it focuses attention on all aspects of the behaviour of chemical entities (e.g. isotopes, elements and ions), in both living and dead matter in landscapes of all kinds. From the viewpoint of general geochemistry, landscape geochemistry focuses on the interaction of the lithosphere with the hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere. This holistic approach provides a common theoretical background for both ""pure"" and ""applied"" environmental geochemistry worldwide. An important aspect of landscape geochemistry, particularly pertinent to environmental geochemistry in the non-Soviet world today, is that the subject provides a link between modern exploration geochemistry and modern environmental science, including geochemistry. Historically, landscape geochemistry stems from the Russian school of ""Landscape Science"". This developed from the ideas of V. V. Dokuchaev (1846-1903) around the turn of the century. Concepts unique to landscape geochemistry were first described in the 1920s by one of Dokuchaev's students, B. B. Polynov (1867-1952). A. 1. Perel'man (1909- ), a student of Polynov, began to teach landscape geochemistry at Moscow University in 1952. Since then, the subject has become firmly established as the focus for fundamental and applied environmental geochemistry in the U.S.S.R. This review traces the development of landscape geochemistry from its origins around 1920 until 1990. The volume of literature pertinent to the review is voluminous. For this reason, attention is usually focused on the basic concepts and principles of landscape geochemistry and related scientific disciplines. Readers who require more detailed information on subjects covered in this review should consult the references cited. The review is organized in four parts. The first three trace the historical development of landscape geochemistry, and related disciplines, in three time periods. These are: (1) pre-1950; (2) between 1950 and 1980; and (3) 1980-1990. Part 4 uses paradigms to summarize the historical evolution of landscape geochemistry and indicates how a Global Landscape Geochemistry might develop in the future. | ['fortescue'] | ",['fortescue'],3
175,"Landscape history and soil properties affect grassland decline and plant species richness in rural landscapes | Past semi-natural grassland extent is thought to have a major influence on contemporary species richness in rural landscapes. The loss of grasslands over the last 300 years was reconstructed for 12 rural landscapes in Sweden, ranging from open modern agricultural landscapes to more forested landscapes. Old maps and aerial photographs from 1950s and today were used to reconstruct landscape patterns in four time-steps to investigate how present plant species richness relates to past grassland extent and decline in old and new grassland habitats. The relative importance of soil properties on the timing of grassland decline was assessed. Plant species occurrence was recorded in managed and abandoned grassland habitats in each landscape.Past and present grassland distribution was a major factor in determining plant species patterns found in grasslands today. All landscapes had an average of 80% grassland 300 years ago. Since then grassland has declined by 90% across all landscapes. Proportion of clay soils influenced the timing of grassland decline, where grasslands in landscapes dominated by clay soils were conversed to crop-fields more than 100 years ago. Grasslands on coarser soils declined later, primarily to forest. Landscapes with more than 10% semi-natural grassland left today had 50% higher species richness in all grasslands, including both abandoned and new grassland. Time since major grassland decline also seems to have an effect on the landscapes' species richness. The results show that plant species patterns in grasslands at local scales are determined by broader landscape processes which may have occurred many centuries ago. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

176,"Landscape planning for the future: using fossil records to independently validate bioclimatic envelope models for economically valuable tree species in Europe | Aim Bioclimatic envelope models (BEMs) for seven economically important tree species in Europe were independently validated using a hindcasting approach and fossil pollen records spanning the last 1000 years, including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the 20th century (PRES). The aim was to determine the accuracy of combining BEMs and palaeoecological data to predict continental-scale changes in distribution, and the availability of fossil data to hindcast economically important species. Location Europe, 11 degrees W33 degrees E, 3372 degrees N. Methods Eight types of BEMs were implemented in this study, covering most state-of-the-art modelling techniques. Present and palaeoclimatic data were obtained from the atmosphereocean global circulation model ECHO-G. The last millennium was divided into three climatically distinct periods: the MWP (ad 9001300), the LIA (ad 16001850) and PRES (ad 19002000). Models were calibrated for each period and validated with climatic and pollen data from the remaining periods. Successfully validated models were projected onto a 1 degrees European grid. Results BEMs were successfully validated with independent data. The average area under the curve statistic showed strong model performance, indicating: (1) the strength of BEMs for modelling current and future distributions and, (2) the potential of fossil pollen records to undertake these approaches. European-scale 1 degrees- gridded maps of probability of occurrence largely agreed with observed 20th-century distributions for most taxa, allowing the construction of past modelled species distributions. Main conclusions Results suggest a high potential for BEMs to be used to model future species distributions, and highlight the importance of palaeoecological data to independently validate these models, taking into account the scales at which these data operate. Although valid, BEMs showed poorer performance with heavily managed species and/or those growing in heterogeneous terrain or with discontinuous distributions. The last millennium in Europe was characterized by an increase in woody crop species and a decline of forest species, suggesting increasing land use by humans. | ['macias', 'fauria', 'willis'] | ","['macias', 'fauria', 'willis']",0
177,"Large Russian lakes ladoga, onega, and imandra under strong pollution and in the period of revitalization: A review | In this paper, retrospective analyses of long-term changes in the aquatic ecosystem of Ladoga, Onega, and Imandra lakes, situated within North-West Russia, are presented. At the beginning of the last century, the lakes were oligotrophic, freshwater and similar in origin in terms of the chemical composition of waters and aquatic fauna. Three stages were identified in this study: reference condition, intensive pollution and degradation, and decreasing pollution and revitalization. Similar changes in polluted bays were detected, for which a significant decrease in their oligotrophic nature, the dominance of eurybiont species, their biodiversity under toxic substances and nutrients, were noted. The lakes have been recolonized by northern species following pollution reduction over the past 20 years. There have been replacements in dominant complexes, an increase in the biodiversity of communities, with the emergence of more southern forms of introduced species. The path of ecosystem transformation during and after the anthropogenic stress compares with the regularities of ecosystem successions: from the natural state through the developmental stage to a more stable mature modification, with significantly different natural characteristics. A peculiarity of the newly formed ecosystems is the change in structure and the higher productivity of biological communities, explained by the stability of the newly formed biogeochemical nutrient cycles, as well as climate warming. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

178,"Large-scale spatial and temporal patterns in population dynamics of the stoat, Mustela erminea, and the least weasel, M-nivalis, in Finland | The stoat and the least weasel are specialist predators of small rodents, and therefore their numbers are likely to depend on the availability of voles. These small predators are ecologically alike, but they differ somewhat in their diet. The stoat is larger in size than the least weasel and therefore capable of using a wider variety of prey species, while the least weasel is more restricted to small mammals. Voles in northern Fennoscandia exhibit cyclic dynamics of 3-5 years with large-scale spatial synchrony and geographical trends in cycle length and amplitude. We predicted that the cyclic dynamics of voles are reflected in the dynamics of their predators with slight differences between the stoat and the least weasel. In this study we use snow-tracking data to characterize the dynamics of small mustelids. The data were collected from different parts of Finland using permanent triangle-shaped census routes of 12 km in 1989 to 2003. Population fluctuations of small mustelids were generally multiannually periodic and in synchrony over large areas, but we did not find any clear geographical gradient in the attribute of small mustelid dynamics comparable to those observed in vole population fluctuations. Instead, we found a similar decreasing temporal trend in the abundances of both species as has been recently reported for voles. | ['helle', 'hellstedt', 'henttonen', 'sundell'] | ","['helle', 'hellstedt', 'henttonen', 'sundell']",4
179,"Laser ablation analysis of bivalve shells - archives of environmental information | Reconstructing past secular environmental variations is an important issue in palaeoclimate research. However, most key variables for palaeoclimate reconstructions cannot be measured directly, and reconstructions are therefore based on proxy data. Here, we demonstrate the potential of bivalve shells as an archive of environmental parameters. The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) has developed a fast and reliable method for chemical analyses of shell material by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and here we present some examples of the use of this method.In tropical and subtropical waters, corals can provide century-long archives of past water chemistry with annual resolution. A comparable archive for temperate and Arctic waters would be highly useful in climate research, and therefore it has been examined whether this can be provided by bivalve shells (e. g. Schoene et al. 2005). Long-lived species may provide archives with annual resolution extending over several hundred years, whereas short-lived, fast-growing species can provide archives with a seasonal or in some cases daily resolution over a period of a few years. Most bivalves are sessile, and shells are commonly preserved as fossils. There are, however, a number of challenges related to the use of bivalves as proxy archives: (1) many proxies show species specific behaviour (Seed 1980); (2) only very few proxies are dependent on a single variable (Wefer et al. 1999); and (3) the effects of biology and ontogeny on the uptake of trace elements and stable isotope fractionation in shell carbonate are largely unknown and have to be evaluated empirically. Therefore, any potential proxy must be calibrated individually for each species of interest before it can be used. A large number of chemical analyses are needed to calibrate a proxy. These are commonly obtained by solution ICP-MS, in which sample preparation is time-consuming and labour-intensive. The use of LA-ICP-MS is therefore a considerable advance in bivalve shell proxy research, as it greatly reduces the effort needed for sample preparation. At the same time, the method requires less material for analysis, thus providing better spatial and hence temporal resolution.Proxies based on bivalve shell carbonate can be used in present-day environmental monitoring, and for environmental reconstructions from shells found as fossils. Shells from museum collections and shells found in archaeological middens can give information on historic and prehistoric environmental conditions (e. g. Carrell et al. 1987), and fossil shells can be used as archives of environmental parameters on geological timescales (e. g. Hendry et al. 2001). | ['frei', 'hippler', 'kluender', 'witbaard'] | ","['frei', 'hippler', 'kluender', 'witbaard']",4
180,"Late-Holocene Development of Subarctic Ombrotrophic Peatlands Allogenic and Autogenic Succession | Ombrotrophic peatlands that developed on islands in Clearwater Lake, a large subarctic lake in northern Quebec [Canada], provide evidence of long-term community stability and successional change. Repeated alternations of regeneration cycles of Sphagnum cushions and black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) over the last 5050 14C years of peatland development suggest climate, self-building mechanisms, and cyclic-autogenic succession as the dominant active factors operating in the absence of external disturbance such as fire. During the last several thousand years, self-perpetuating vegetation cycles have occurred at variable periodicity and have been controlled primarily by local ecological conditions whose existence is marked by differential peat accumulation rates. Water supply for peat production, in the absence of a water table in most sites, was controlled by snow availability, precipitation, and atmospheric humdity from the large lake. Allogenic succession, illustrated by the community shifts from Sphagnum girgensohnii-Piea to S. russowii-Picea, S. fuscum-Picea, and lichen-heath, has been initiated by climate, and more particularly by continuous peat accumulation enhancing, as time passed, the ecological gradient from moist, snow-protected conditions to snowless, exposed conditions. In contrast, absence of such changes at some sites characterized by a uniform, self-regenerated S. fuscum-Picea assemblage suggests that autogenic succession has been an active driving mechanism in community persistence over several thousand years. Large-term trends in peatland development toward topographic equilibrium and late-Holocene cooling best explain the gradual phasing-out of the vegetation cycles. Natural deforestation over the last 2000 14C years may have triggered a negative feedback process by changing the winter snow environment and the associated thermal soil regime. The ensuring peat fossilization, permafrost aggradation, and ice-wedge development at the peatland surface are all events consistent with the occurrence of this process. Present growth of the peatland proceeds mostly along the margoms, where levelling of the topographic profile is not yet completed. | ['payette'] | ",['payette'],3
181,"Late holocene human impact and climate change recorded in a North Swedish peat deposit | A peat core from a mire with poor fen lawns and ombrotrophic hummock strings in Northern Sweden was examined (plant macrofossils, pollen/non-pollen microfossils, testate amoebae, colorimetric humification, carbon/nitrogen ratios, bulk densities, loss on ignition) to investigate the effects of climate change and human impact on the plant species composition and peat accumulation of the peat forming vegetation during the last 1700 yr. <sup>14</sup>C wiggle-match dating was applied for high-precision dating. The Lappmyran region was dominated by Pinus and Picea forest. Changes in land-use patterns and population density were visible in the pollen record of the regional vegetation. Juniperus and Rumex acetosa-type pollen indicated the presence of grazed land in the area between AD 1500 and 1950. The vegetation at the coring spot gradually became ombrotrophic. The local plant and testate amoebae compositions reflect changes in surface wetness caused by changes in precipitation and the internal dynamics of the bog. A wet interval was observed during the Maunder minimum of solar activity. The presence of Drepanocladus fluitans indicates less ombrotrophic conditions during this period probably caused by the inflow of minerogenic water from upslope owing to increased precipitation. The reconstructed water table shows agreement with precipitation measurements which were available since AD 1860. | ['barke', 'charman', 'geel', 'linden', 'vickery'] | ","['barke', 'charman', 'geel', 'linden', 'vickery']",1

To explore changes in chironomid functional responses and carbon utilization in relation to long-term environmental change, we studied a sediment core covering ca. 2000 years from a tundra lake in northern Finland, which was analysed for sediment geochemistry, isotopic composition of chironomid remains and their functional assemblages. We aimed to relate changes in chironomid functional feeding assemblages and resource utilization, based on Bayesian stable isotope modelling, and determined that the long-term resource utilization was more controlled by sediment geochemistry (resource availability) and climatic variables, reflecting changes in habitat and lake ontogeny, rather than the functional feeding assemblage composition. Change horizons were observed for both sediment geochemistry and functional assemblage composition. However, different timing of these changes suggests different drivers affecting the dynamics of primary production and chironomid community functionality. We also compared the recent warming period to Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), observing divergent patterns, which suggests that MCA may not be a good analogue for changes induced by on-going climate warming. | ['kivila', 'luoto', 'nevalainen', 'rantala'] | ","['kivila', 'luoto', 'nevalainen', 'rantala']",0
183,"Holocene lateral expansion and carbon accumulation of Luovuoma, a northern fen in Finnish Lapland | Holocene lateral expansion and carbon accumulation within Luovuoma, a northern fen in Finnish Lapland, were examined utilizing stratigraphy, peat properties such as humification and macrofossil composition, 58 radio-carbon dates and the carbon content of 31 volumetric samples, in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time. Paludification started about 9800 years ago. The lateral expansion of the mire was most rapid during phases subsequent to the first signs of paludification, with the result that by 5000 cal. yr BP 79% of the present area of Luovuoma supported mire vegetation. The mire initially expanded laterally at a relatively fast rate with an irregular outline, and only gradually attained its more regular existing form. This is corroborated by the amounts of carbon accumulated during different times: 58% of the carbon had formed before the time point of 5000 cal. yr BP. The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on the vertical and lateral growth of the peat deposit, was 11.8 g C/m(2)/yr. Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variable local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored. A marked decline in average carbon accumulation rates (from 26 to 9 g C/m(2)/yr) during the period between 7800 and 4900 cal. yr BP may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4900 cal. yr BP, with special reference to the youngest areas of Luovuoma, indicates a change to a predominantly cooler and moister climate. The stratigraphy of Luovuoma suggests that carbon exchange and accumulation by the mire has always been sensitive to climatic fluctuations, which have been characteristic of the entire Holocene. | ['makila', 'moisanen'] | ","['makila', 'moisanen']",0
184,"Latitude, elevation, richness and hotspots of change across the Americas: a test of Orloci's plant compositional transition hypotheses throughout the Holocene | Our understanding of how plant communities will respond to current and future climate change has advanced considerably since the use of early climate models to predict specific local temperature and precipitation changes, and thereby plant transitions, at the beginning of climate change recognition and research. The collection, availability and spatial distribution of pollen records across the Americas has recently allowed us to investigate plant compositional transitions during climate change periods in the past. Results from these models and pollen record investigations have provided formulated hypotheses, led by Laszlo Orloci, in palynology and climate change ecology predicting that high latitude, high elevation and species-rich communities have shown greater plant compositional transitions during periods of climate change in the past, show greater change today, and will show greater change in the future. To address hypotheses for the past, and infer changes for the future, we used 238 pollen records across North and South America to test if latitude, elevation and taxa richness defined plant compositional transitions and their rates of change over the past 10,000 years, representing the majority of the Holocene (11.7k -150 ybp), and if transitions were identifiable as hotspots of change. Contradicting Orloci's hypothesis we found low latitude records to show greater transitions during the late Holocene, associated with increased aridity leading to Amazon, deciduous and Atlantic forest - Caatinga, Cerrado shifts at low latitudes. Higher elevations showed greater plant compositional transitions during the late Holocene, providing support for Orloci's hypothesis of greater plant transitions at higher elevations, associated with Andean cooling over the past 5k years. Richness explained less of plant compositional transition than latitude and elevation and showed positive, negative and no relationships showing no clear conclusive pattern. Climate change research solely at high latitudes and high elevations overlooks consequences of climate shifts on other ecosystems, such as tropical forests of northeastern South America showing past increased aridity and predicted future drought probability of 80% by 2050 leading to predicted 20% forest loss by the end of the century. | ['anand', 'leithead'] | ","['anand', 'leithead']",1
185,"Lepidoptera wing scales: a new paleoecological indicator for reconstructing spruce budworm abundance | Natural disturbances have a major impact on boreal forest landscape dynamics, and although fire history is well documented at the Holocene scale, spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) (SBW) dynamics have only been known for the last three centuries. This is likely due to the difficulty in using and interpreting existing indicators (cephalic head capsules and feces). In this methodological study, we present an original approach using lepidopteran wing scales to reconstruct insect abundance. We analyzed two sediment cores from the boreal forest in central Quebec and extracted wing scales at every stratigraphic level. The required quantity of sediment for paleoecological analysis is relatively small given the large quantity of wing scales produced by Lepidoptera and their small size. Scales are well preserved due to their chitinous structure and their great variety of shapes offer a high potential for taxonomic identification. A statistical model based on the shape of scales of the three major epidemic lepidopterans in Quebec discriminated 68% of SBW scales. This indicator allows a more efficient and more precise reconstruction of SBW history with respect to the use of cephalic head capsules or feces. | ['harvey', 'morin', 'navarro'] | ","['harvey', 'morin', 'navarro']",3
186,"Lichen Specific Thallus Mass and Secondary Compounds Change across a Retrogressive Fire-Driven Chronosequence | In the long-term absence of major disturbances ecosystems enter a state of retrogression, which involves declining soil fertility and consequently a reduction in decomposition rates. Recent studies have looked at how plant traits such as specific leaf mass and amounts of secondary compounds respond to declining soil fertility during retrogression, but there are no comparable studies for lichen traits despite increasing recognition of the role that lichens can play in ecosystem processes. We studied a group of 30 forested islands in northern Sweden differing greatly in fire history, and collectively representing a retrogressive chronosequence, spanning 5000 years. We used this system to explore how specific thallus mass (STM) and carbon based secondary compounds (CBSCs) change in three common epiphytic lichen species (Hypogymnia phsyodes, Melanohalea olivacea and Parmelia sulcata) as soil fertility declines during this retrogression. We found that STMs of lichens increased sharply during retrogression, and for all species soil N to P ratio (which increased during retrogression) was a strong predictor of STM. When expressed per unit area, medullary CBSCs in all species and cortical CBSCs in P. sulcata increased during retrogression. Meanwhile, when expressed per unit mass, only cortical CBSCs in H. physodes responded to retrogression, and in the opposite direction. Given that lichen functional traits are likely to be important in driving ecological processes that drive nutrient and carbon cycling in the way that plant functional traits are, the changes that they undergo during retrogression could potentially be significant for the functioning of the ecosystem.

187,"Little ice age temperature estimated by growth and flowering differences between subfossil and extant shoots of Cassiope tetragona, an arctic heather | 1. A unique opportunity to study conditions for plant growth at the onset of glaciation was offered as a retreating glacier at Ellesmere Island, Canada, revealed well-preserved, subfossil plants (411 +- 70 radio-carbon years old) of Cassiope tetragona, an arctic dwarf-shrub previously used to study climate-related growth of modem plants. 2. Growth and flowering of the ancient and modem shoots of C. tetragona from the same locality were examined retrospectively. The ancient shoots produced leaves in each, and flowers in each except one, of the last 26 years before they died, although this production was significantly lower and less variable among years than in the modem shoots. 3. Predictions based on regression between modem plant performance and climatic data from the study site imply that the mean July temperature of the period immediately preceding the glaciation of the area was about 0.7 degree C lower than today.

188,"Long-lived lake molluscs as island faunas: A bivalve perspective | The evolutionary biology of long-lived lake bivalves, a group that has received comparatively little attention compared to, for example, gastropods and ostracods, is reviewed. Bivalve faunas of different (fossil and extant) long-lived lakes are characterised, and evolutionary aspects, such as the paucity of radiations of common cosmopolitan freshwater groups like sphaeriid and corbiculid clams are addressed. Special attention is given to the corbulid radiations in Miocene Lake Pebas of Western Amazonia. The ability to evolve morphological and ecological characteristics in long-lived lake biota that exceed the range of variation of their relatives in ""ordinary"" (non-long-lived lake) environments is discussed and termed ""supralimital evolution"". Several examples are discussed that show that such evolution is facilitated by the availability of empty biotopes after ecological crises in ecosystems at the onset of long-lived lake stages that are stable on ecological time scales. Implications for uniformitarian applications of long-lived lake biota are discussed. | ['wesselingh'] | ",['wesselingh'],2
189,"Long-term changes in aquatic plant species composition in North-eastern European Russia and Finnish Lapland, as evidenced by plant macrofossil analysis | Three lake sediment sequences from North-eastern European Russia and one from Finnish Lapland were studied for aquatic plant macrofossils. Ages of sediment sequences varied between 12 800 and ca. 10 500 radiocarbon years. Historical records showed distinct changes in the diversity and abundances of aquatic plant remains in each lake's history. Despite the studied lakes being located in different vegetation and climate zones, the records showed a similar long-term pattern of the early Holocene immigration of aquatics, a subsequent maximum in aquatic species richness, and a decline or disappearance after the mid Holocene. It seems that the warming temperature together with sufficient nutrient status enabled establishment of aquatic plant communities during the early Holocene. Afterwards the presence of the limnophytes was probably mainly controlled by the length of the open-water season (i.e. temperature), with changes in nutrient status and water level possibly being additional minor factors. Climate-driven change is supported by the fact that currently aquatic macrophytes are often absent from the lakes beyond tree lines, which are characterized by a short growing season.

190,"Long-term climate variability in continental subarctic Canada: A 6200-year record derived from stable isotopes in peat | The rapid warming of arctic regions during recent decades has been recorded by instrumental monitoring, but the natural climate variability in the past is still sparsely reconstructed across many areas. We have reconstructed past climate changes in subarctic west-central Canada. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (Œ¥13C, Œ¥18O) were derived from a single Sphagnum fuscum plant component; Œ±-cellulose isolated from stems. Periods of warmer and cooler conditions identified in this region, described in terms of a ""Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly"" and ""Little Ice Age"" were registered in the temperature reconstruction based on the Œ¥13C record. Some conclusions could be drawn about wet/dry shifts during the same time interval from the Œ¥18O record, humification indices and the macrofossil analysis. The results were compared with other proxy data from the vicinity of the study area. The amplitude of the temperature change was similar to that in chironomid based reconstructions, showing c. 6.5¬±2.3¬∞C variability in July temperatures during the past 6.2ka. ¬© 2010 Elsevier B.V. | ['holzk√§mper', 'kaislahti', 'tillman', 'kuhry', 'loader', 'robertson', 'sannel'] | ","['holzk√§mper', 'kaislahti', 'tillman', 'kuhry', 'loader', 'robertson', 'sannel']",3

Unfortunately, such direct measurements are rarely available. Long-term data are especially sparse in arctic tundra regions, where logistic concerns often preclude the implementation of standard monitoring programs. However, paleolimnological techniques, such as the use of diatom assemblages preserved in dated lake and pond sediment profiles, can provide proxy data of past environmental changes. This paper summarizes some of the ways biologicalbased paleolimnological techniques can be used in arctic tundra environments to monitor environmental changes.

192,"The long-term fate of permafrost peatlands under rapid climate warming | Permafrost peatlands contain globally important amounts of soil organic carbon, owing to cold conditions which suppress anaerobic decomposition. However, climate warming and permafrost thaw threaten the stability of this carbon store. The ultimate fate of permafrost peatlands and their carbon stores is unclear because of complex feedbacks between peat accumulation, hydrology and vegetation. Field monitoring campaigns only span the last few decades and therefore provide an incomplete picture of permafrost peatland response to recent rapid warming. Here we use a high-resolution palaeoecological approach to understand the longer-term response of peatlands in contrasting states of permafrost degradation to recent rapid warming. At all sites we identify a drying trend until the late-twentieth century; however, two sites subsequently experienced a rapid shift to wetter conditions as permafrost thawed in response to climatic warming, culminating in collapse of the peat domes. Commonalities between study sites lead us to propose a five-phase model for permafrost peatland response to climatic warming. This model suggests a shared ecohydrological trajectory towards a common end point: inundated Arctic fen. Although carbon accumulation is rapid in such sites, saturated soil conditions are likely to cause elevated methane emissions that have implications for climate-feedback mechanisms. | ['amesbury', 'carrivick', 'charman', 'gallego', 'sala', 'galloway', 'garneau', 'holden', 'kokfelt', 'morris', 'mullan', 'parry', 'pratte', 'roland', 'sanderson', 'schoning', 'swindle', 'turner', 'watson', 'woulds'] | ","['amesbury', 'carrivick', 'charman', 'gallego', 'sala', 'galloway', 'garneau', 'holden', 'kokfelt', 'morris', 'mullan', 'parry', 'pratte', 'roland', 'sanderson', 'schoning', 'swindle', 'turner', 'watson', 'woulds']",1
193,"Long-term and fine-scale coexistence of closely related species | Models of coexistence often assume that competitive exclusion takes place at fine scale, but that disturbances (non-equilibrium models) or heterogeneity (spatial models) are necessary for long-term coexistence. As an alternative, very slow exclusion among competitively equivalent species has been proposed, but questioned on the ground that in the long ran even the smallest difference in competitive ability will express itself in the loss of species. In this paper we demonstrate long-term coexistence among closely-related mire plant species (notably Sphagnum mosses). In any bog in the boreal region, most species that can tolerate the nutrient-poor, acidic and partly anaerobic conditions are present. Thus, the ratio between the actual and regional species pool is 1 (or very close to 1), and selection of species from the regional pool seems hardly affected by interspecific competition or dispersal limitation. The evidence for coexistence comes from experiments and permanent plots (time scale 1-10 yrs), remapping (40-60 yrs) and stratigraphy (100-2000 yrs), and the spatial scale is cm-ha. At the cm-scale there were no cases of competitive exclusion, even when species were transplanted into each others microsites, and for 10 x 10-cm plots published stratigraphic data showed that combinations with 2-4 species lasted for 200-300 yrs on average, and in some cases almost 1000 yrs. Most temperate ecosystems will not remain without substantial changes in conditions for such a long time. Thus, exclusion among similar species can be so slow that it may well explain the coexistence for the whole ""life-time"" of a community. | ['barber', 'rydin'] | ","['barber', 'rydin']",1
194,"Long-term fluctuations of a caribou population revealed by tree-ring data | We used a dendroecological approach that involved examination of debarking lesions (trampling scars) produced by caribou (Rangifer tarandus) hooves on surficial roots and low branches of conifers to assess caribou activity in the summer range of the Riviere George caribou herd in northeastern Quebec-Labrador over the last 100 years. We deduced changes in caribou activity from the age-frequency distributions of trampling scars in three widely spaced (>100 km) old-growth conifer stands in the Riviere George area. We used the fluctuating patterns in age distributions, described by residuals of the log-linear regression, as an index of the number of trampling scars with time. This index indicated that caribou activity at the three sites followed a general decreasing trend from the turn of the last century to around 1950. There were two stages of rapid decline, around 1905-1915 and 1940, separated by a minor increase in the 1920-1930s. A sustained increase occurred from the 1950s to the 1980s. A comparison with survey and historical data for caribou suggested that these fluctuations in this common signal of activity at the three sites resulted mainly from fluctuations in caribou abundance that occurred throughout the 20th century in northeastern Quebec-Labrador. The increase in caribou activity during the 1920-1930s suggested by the frequency of trampling scars is not reported in the historical record. Caribou trampling scars on conifers may offer a new opportunity to assess large-scale spatial and temporal population trends of caribou in subarctic and boreal zones. | ['morneau', 'payette'] | ","['morneau', 'payette']",4
195,"Long-term interactions between migratory caribou, wildfires and nunavik hunters inferred from tree rings | Barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herds in North America may reach considerable size and undertake large-scale seasonal migrations from the Arctic tundra to the boreal forest. To test the caribou decline hypothesis associated with native harvesting and fire, we have documented the long-term trends of caribou activity based on a novel approach which uses tree-ring dated trampling scars produced by caribou hooves in the extensive trails distributed over the summer and winter ranges of the Riviere-aux-Feuilles herd (RAF herd, east of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec). The age structure data of trampling scars from lichen woodlands distributed over the entire RAF range confirmed the overall trends of caribou activity from the late 1700s to present time. Over the last 200 years, the RAF herd has undergone two highs in the late 1700s and 1900s separated by a moderate activity pattern in the late 1800s. Native harvesting was possibly involved in the early 1900s decline, although at a moderate level. The reduced magnitude of caribou activity during this period has not modified the natural cycle of highs and lows, which suggests that other demographic factors were controlling the changing caribou abundance. Our data also show that only exceptionally large fires may have a minor, short-lived impact on caribou migrations but not on caribou numbers. | ['boudreau', 'morneau', 'payette', 'pitre'] | ","['boudreau', 'morneau', 'payette', 'pitre']",4
196,"Long-term Perspectives on Salmon Abundance: Evidence from Lake Sediments and Tree Rings | Here we review developments in paleoecological reconstruction of Pacific salmon abundance and discuss the new management context and implications provided by the reconstructions. Currently, two approaches are yielding long term reconstructions of salmon abundance over the last hundreds to thousands of years. First, in sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka nursery lakes, the abundance of adult salmon is reflected in chemical and biological characteristics of lake sediments. These indicators have been used to reconstruct patterns of salmon abundance over 2,500 years and are compared at several points by archeological data. Second, emerging techniques using riparian tree-ring-growth have produced sub-decadal resolution reconstructions of stream-spawning sockeye, Chinook O. tshawytscha, pink O. gorbuscha, and chum O. keta salmon populations over the last 150-350 years. Paleoecological reconstructions provide important insights into salmon abundance and their variability prior to European settlement of western North America. For example, sediment-based reconstructions show periods of naturally low sockeye salmon abundance at similar to A.D. 1800 and from similar to A.D. 0-700 in Alaskan lakes, and tree-ring based reconstructions show river-specific patterns in abundance with cycles of 21-68 years in duration. Both types of reconstruction also suggest relatively rapid, natural ""recovery"" of salmon populations after periods of low abundance. As additional reconstructions become available and a more synthetic understanding of them is developed, paleoecological reconstructions will allow better evaluation of management paradigms (e.g., the long-term fidelity of Pacific Decadal Oscillation cycles and regional salmon abundance) as well as identification of additional patterns that cannot be extracted from limited historical data sets. Paleoecological perspectives play a potentially important role in changing societal expectations of salmon resources by recognizing natural variations in abundance. Such expectations, if tempered by acknowledging natural changes in salmon productivity, can be incorporated into flexible models, management and restoration strategies. | ['drake', 'finney', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'naiman'] | ","['drake', 'finney', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'naiman']",0
197,"A long-term perspective on ungulate-vegetation interactions | The fossil record of vegetation and ungulates places present conditions and trends in a temporal perspective. Ungulate-vegetation interactions during the last 500 000 years were primarily driven by the climatic variation of the glacial-interglacial cycle. There were distinctive faunas associated with each temperate period and a loss of species diversity only in the present interglacial. Climate change and human activities have interacted during the most recent glacial cycle, accelerating extinction rates. This unique course of events has the consequence that no stable, 'base-line' conditions can be recognised. A review of the full-glacial 'mammoth-steppe' debate suggests that ungulate populations were limited by available forage, but a mosaic of habitat supported a diverse fauna in Beringia. In the debate over early-mid Holocene 'wood pasture', past ungulate populations are one of a range of disturbance factors, including burning, that influenced regional vegetation composition and structure in northern Europe. These debates concerning the scale and impacts of past ungulate-vegetation interactions will not be fully resolved until more is known about past ungulate population sizes. Modelling past scenarios would enhance the value of retrospective studies and help provide goals for management of near-natural ecosystems. | ['bradshaw', 'hannon', 'lister'] | ","['bradshaw', 'hannon', 'lister']",3
198,"Long-term sensitivity of a High Arctic wetland to Holocene climate change | The response of peat-rich permafrost soils to human-induced climate change may be especially important in modifying the global C-flux. We examined the Holocene developmental record of a High Arctic peat-forming wetland to investigate its sensitivity to past climate change and aid understanding of the likely effects of future climate warming on high-latitude ecosystems.The microhabitat of mosses was quantified in the present-day polygon-complex at Bylot Island (73 degrees N, 80 degrees W) and used to interpret the radiocarbon-dated macrofossil record of three cores, comprising c. 3500 years of wetland development. Recurrent wet and dry phases in the reconstructed palaeohydrological record indicated pronounced temporal variability. Wet and dry phases were compared between cores and with palaeoclimatic proxy values, measured as percentage melt and delta O-18 in nearby ice cores.Periodic wet and dry phases appear unrelated to past climate over c. 50% of the combined stratigraphic records, and are attributable instead to geomorphological mechanisms. At other times, association of wet and dry phases with significantly lower and higher values of percentage melt and delta O-18 indicate a possible effect of past climate change on polygon hydrology and vegetation, although inconsistencies between cores suggest that local geomorphological processes continued to modify a regional climatic effect. However, during a period incorporating the Little Ice Age (c. 305-530 cal. years BP), reconstructed moisture and vegetation change is pronounced and consistent among all three cores.The results provide strong evidence for the sensitivity of a High Arctic terrestrial ecosystem to past climate change during the Holocene. The estimated magnitude of changes in soil moisture between wet and dry phases is sufficient to imply recurrent shifts in wetland function, periodically impacted upon by pronounced climatic variability, although controlled principally by autogenic processes. The structure and function of such wetlands may therefore be susceptible to predicted, human-induced climate warming. | ['elli', 'rochefort'] | ","['elli', 'rochefort']",1
199,"Long-term successional changes in peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada inferred from the ecological dynamics of multiple proxies | Peatlands in northern Ontario, Canada, archive multiple biological indicators, including macrofossils, algae, testate amoebae, and pollen. These proxies can provide insights concerning the timing and nature of long-term climatic and environmental changes. The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of central Canada contain one of Earth's largest continuous peatland complexes, and thus comprehensive spatial and temporal studies are needed to understand the implications of climate change on carbon cycling. Diatom assemblages were examined in three cores retrieved from ombrotrophic bogs across two Canadian terrestrial ecozones. Comparisons were made with testate amoebae and macrofossil data previously analyzed from these cores, as well as with regional pollen records from surrounding peatlands. From 2000 to 600 cal. BP, changes in diatom composition likely reflect hydrosere succession within the peatland, including fluctuations in connectivity to the water table and pH changes. From 600 cal. BP to present, the synchronous timing of changes in diatoms and testate amoebae are tracking drying conditions and subsequent microhabitat variations that occur within bogs. It is possible that diatoms are tracking subtle changes in the stability of peat microforms including bog hollows and hummocks, highlighting their sensitivity to small chemical change, whereas testate amoebae are tracking the lowering of a peatland water table and subsequent drying of the peatland. The use of multiple proxies provides a more holistic approach to interpreting past ecological succession and responses to climate within peatlands. When present and well preserved, diatoms can be applied to track drying conditions in bogs, in terms of both hydrosere succession and present climatic change. | ['bunbury', 'finkelstein', 'hargan', 'holmquist', 'macdonald', 'paterson', 'ruehland', 'smol'] | ","['bunbury', 'finkelstein', 'hargan', 'holmquist', 'macdonald', 'paterson', 'ruehland', 'smol']",0
200,"Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon | At the last deglaciation Earth's largest biome, mammoth-steppe, vanished. Without knowledge of the productivity of this ecosystem, the evolution of man and the glacial interglacial dynamics of carbon storage in Earth's main carbon reservoirs cannot be fully understood. Analyzes of fossils C-14 dates and reconstruction of mammoth steppe climatic envelope indicated that changing climate wasn't a reason for extinction of this ecosystem. We calculate, based on animal skeleton density in frozen soils of northern Siberia, that mammoth-steppe animal biomass and plant productivity, even in these coldest and driest of the planet's grasslands were close to those of an African savanna. Numerous herbivores maintained ecosystem productivity. By reducing soil moisture and permafrost temperature, accumulating carbon in soils, and increasing the regional albedo, mammoth-steppe amplified glacial interglacial climate variations. The re-establishment of grassland ecosystems would slow permafrost thawing and reduce the current warming rate. Proposed methods can be used to estimate animal density in other ecosystems.

Cortisol concentration was independent of sex and age, and was found at significantly higher (p < 0.001) concentrations in historical hair samples (1892-1927; n = 8) relative to recent ones (1988-2009; n = 88). In addition, there was a linear time trend in cortisol concentration of the recent samples (p < 0.01), with an annual decrease of 2.7%. The recent hair samples were also analyzed for major bioaccumulative, persistent organic pollutants (POPs). There were no obvious POP related time trends or correlations between hair cortisol and hair POP concentrations. Thus, polar bear hair appears to be a relatively poor indicator of the animal's general POP load in adipose tissue. However, further investigations are warranted to explore the reasons for the temporal decrease found in the bears' hair cortisol levels. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. | ['bechsh√∏ft', '√ò', 'covaci', 'dietz', 'eens', 'eulaers', 'henchey', 'jasper', 'letcher', 'meyer', 'muir', 'novak', 'rig√©t', 'sonne'] | ","['bechsh√∏ft', '√ò', 'covaci', 'dietz', 'eens', 'eulaers', 'henchey', 'jasper', 'letcher', 'meyer', 'muir', 'novak', 'rig√©t', 'sonne']",3

This project is designed to explore the effects of microclimatic variability, past and future climate change (1913-2100) on regional vegetation and land-use changes, at an unique Arctic ecological and climate monitoring site, to aid adaptation of stakeholders to future climate change. Dominant altitudinal lapse rate and radiation effects during summer are revealed in detailed analysis of spatial variations in temperature between the different sites, which become largely negated during winter when cold-air ponding is much more significant. Moreover, near-shore temperatures are moderated significantly by Lake Tornetr√§sk during the spring lake-ice melt season. The extent to which synoptic meteorological conditions affect these factors is explored. Examples of gridded temperature maps for the Abisko region are also presented, produced using a downscaling model based on the temperature data, which have numerous ecological and other applications.

203,"Minnesota diatomists: The first 150 years | Minnesota boasts over 12,000 lakes, most of glacial origin, three major continental drainage systems (Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, Lake Superior via the other Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, and the Red River of the North via the Nelson River, to Hudson Bay), and a diversity of landforms comprising seven major ecological regions. Such landscape and aquatic variability hosts a high diversity of diatoms, which have been studied for over 150 years. Diatom communities range from saline and eutrophic in the southwest agricultural lands, to oligotrophic and endemic forms in the cold waters of Lake Superior. Early diatom collections were distributed to reknowned diatomists such as C.G. Ehrenberg and H.L. Smith. Other botanists and phycologists, including Tilden, Eddy, and Drouet, were active in Minnesota but only rarely included diatoms in their studies. Interest in Minnesota diatoms increased in the latter half of the 20th century with taxonomic and floristic surveys (e.g., Czarnecki, Koppen, and Kingston) and the inclusion of diatoms in applied research efforts that set the groundwork for understanding post-glacial ecology, effects of Euroamerican settlement, impacts of climate, and the effects of acid precipitation. Important to these latter developments were the efforts of Dr. Herb Wright Jr., who invited several European diatomists (e.g., Florin, Battarbee, and Haworth) to work on paleoecological projects in and near Minnesota. Although not a diatomist per se, Wright's subsequent efforts to promote diatom research included the appointment of Platt Bradbury as a research associate and later John Kingston, Dick Brugam, and Brian Cumming. Students Sheri Fritz, Kate Laird, and Virginia Card completed diatom research for their doctoral degrees. These workers and others have left a legacy that continues to fuel several active labs in Minnesota that have used diatoms to develop water quality standards, assess and restore impaired waters, and understand the impacts of climate, management, and landuse change across the state. | ['edlund', 'stoermer'] | ","['edlund', 'stoermer']",0
204,"Modeling Holocene peatland carbon accumulation in North America | Peatlands are a large carbon reservoir. Yet the quantification of their carbon stock still has a large uncertainty due to lacking observational data and well-tested peatland biogeochemistry models. Here, a process-based peatland model was calibrated using long-term peat carbon accumulation data at multiple sites in North America. The model was then applied to quantify the peat carbon accumulation rates and stocks within North America over the last 12,000 years. We estimated that 85-174 Pg carbon was accumulated in North American peatlands over the study period including 0.37-0.76 Pg carbon in subtropical peatlands. During the period from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago, the warmer and wetter conditions might have played an important role in stimulating peat carbon accumulation by enhancing plant photosynthesis. Enhanced peat decomposition due to warming slowed the carbon accumulation through the rest of the Holocene. While recent modeling studies indicate that the northern peatlands will continue to act as a carbon sink in this century, our studies suggest that future enhanced peat decomposition accompanied by peatland areal changes induced by permafrost degradation and other disturbances shall confound the sink and source analysis. | ['aire', 'bridgham', 'keller', 'prigent', 'wang', 'yu', 'zhao', 'zhuang'] | ","['aire', 'bridgham', 'keller', 'prigent', 'wang', 'yu', 'zhao', 'zhuang']",3

However, most DGVMs do not yet have detailed representations of permafrost and non-permafrost peatlands, which are an important store of carbon, particularly at high latitudes. We demonstrate a new implementation of peatland dynamics in a customized ""Arctic"" version of the LPJ-GUESS DGVM, simulating the long-term evolution of selected northern peatland ecosystems and assessing the effect of changing climate on peatland carbon balance. Our approach employs a dynamic multi-layer soil with representation of freeze-thaw processes and litter inputs from a dynamically varying mixture of the main peatland plant functional types: mosses, shrubs and graminoids. The model was calibrated and tested for a sub-Arctic mire in Stordalen, Sweden, and validated at a temperate bog site in Mer Bleue, Canada. A regional evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes, hydrology and vegetation dynamics encompassed additional locations spread across Scandinavia. Simulated peat accumulation was found to be generally consistent with published data and the model was able to capture reported long-term vegetation dynamics, water table position and carbon fluxes. A series of sensitivity experiments were carried out to investigate the vulnerability of high-latitude peatlands to climate change. We found that the Stordalen mire may be expected to sequester more carbon in the first half of the 21st century due to milder and wetter climate conditions, a longer growing season, and the CO2 fertilization effect, turning into a carbon source after mid-century because of higher decomposition rates in response to warming soils. | ['chaudhary', 'miller', 'smith'] | ","['chaudhary', 'miller', 'smith']",0
206,"The use of modelling and simulation approach in reconstructing past landscapes from fossil pollen data: a review and results from the POLLANDCAL network | Information on past land cover in terms of absolute areas of different landscape units (forest, open land, pasture land, cultivated land, etc.) at local to regional scales is needed to test hypotheses and answer questions related to climate change (e.g. feedbacks effects of land-cover change), archaeological research, and nature conservancy (e.g. management strategy). The palaeoecological technique best suited to achieve quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation is pollen analysis. A simulation approach developed by Sugita (the computer model POLLSCAPE) which uses models based on the theory of pollen analysis is presented together with examples of application. POLLSCAPE has been adopted as the central tool for POLLANDCAL (POLlen/LANdscape CALibration), an international research network focusing on this topic. The theory behind models of the pollen-vegetation relationship and POLLSCAPE is reviewed. The two model outputs which receive greatest attention in this paper are the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) and pollen loading in mires and lakes. Six examples of application of POLLSCAPE are presented, each of which explores a possible use of the POLLANDCAL tools and a means of validating or evaluating the models with empirical data. The landscape and vegetation factors influencing the size of the RSAP, the importance of pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) for the model outputs, the detection of small and rare patches of plant taxa in pollen records, and quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation and landscapes are discussed on the basis of these examples. The simulation approach is seen to be useful both for exploring different vegetation/landscape scenarios and for refuting hypotheses. | ['brostrom', 'bunting', 'caseldine', 'gaillard', 'giesecke', 'hellman', 'hick', 'hjelle', 'langdon', 'member', 'middleton', 'nielsen', 'poska', 'sugita', 'veski', 'von', 'stedingk'] | ","['brostrom', 'bunting', 'caseldine', 'gaillard', 'giesecke', 'hellman', 'hick', 'hjelle', 'langdon', 'member', 'middleton', 'nielsen', 'poska', 'sugita', 'veski', 'von', 'stedingk']",1
207,"A modern pollen-climate calibration set from northern Europe: Developing and testing a tool for palaeoclimatological reconstructions | Aims and location: The potential of pollen records in quantitative climate reconstructions has been widely debated but seldom tested. Our aim is to develop a pollen-climate transfer function for northern Europe and test its performance and inference power by numerical cross-validation with modern climate data. Annual mean temperature (Tann) was assessed as the critical climatic variable because Tann has a distinct south-north gradient (5.5 to -4.7degreeC) in the study region with a corresponding zonal vegetation gradient from the hemiboreal zone in the south to the northern boreal zone in the north. Methods: We collected 137 pollen surface samples from small- to medium size lakes from southern Estonia to northern Finland. The transfer function for Tann was developed with weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression. All 102 terrestrial pollen and spore types were included in the calculation sum and all 137 surface samples and all 102 taxa were included in the transfer function. The performance of the WA-PLS transfer function was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: A cross-validated root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of our model is 0.89degreeC and the coefficient of determination (r2) between the observed meteorological Tann values and those predicted by the model in leave-one-out cross-validation is 0.88. The RMSEP as a percentage of the gradient length of Tann is 8.8%. These figures indicate high performance statistics for our transfer function compared with other inference models. This is probably because of standardization of our surface-sampling and pollen-analytical procedures, careful selection of the surface sample sites with consideration of the relevant pollen source area, the simple patterns of vegetation zones and climate in the study area, and the mostly natural floristic composition of the forests in northern Europe. However, we also demonstrate the limitations of our model in reliably detecting fine-scale climatic variability. Main conclusions: The study shows the strong influence of Tann on modern pollen composition and demonstrates the potential of pollen data for long-term climate reconstructions in northern Europe. It also provides evidence against simple interpretations of fine-scale variations in a single climate reconstruction. In particular, our results highlight the importance of careful study design and implementation in the construction of pollen-climate transfer functions. | ['birks', 'odland', 'poska', 'seppa', 'veski'] | ","['birks', 'odland', 'poska', 'seppa', 'veski']",1

Pollen samples are found to be poor at reflecting actual ground cover where ericales or Juniperus communis are the locally dominant shrubs. Dominant or ubiquitous taxa within this landscape (Betula, Salix and Poaceae) are found to be over-represented in pollen assemblages, as are several of the 'weeds' generally accepted as introduced by the Norse settlers.Main Conclusions Due to their over-representation in the pollen rain, many of the Norse apophytes and introductions (e.g. Rumex acetosa and R. acetosella) traditionally used to infer human activity in Greenland should be particularly sensitive indicators for landnam, allowing early detection of Norse activity in fossil assemblages. Pteridophyte spores are found to be disassociated with the ground cover of ferns and clubmosses, but are over-represented in pollen assemblages, indicating extra-local or regional sources and long residence times in soil/sediment profiles for these microfossils. A pollen record for Hordeum-type registered in close proximity to a field containing barley suggests that summer temperatures under the current climatic regime are, at least on occasion, sufficient to allow flowering. | ['edward', 'mcmullen', 'schofield'] | ","['edward', 'mcmullen', 'schofield']",3
209,"Monitoring forest-tundra ecotones at multiple scales | The transition from forest to tundra in Arctic and alpine regions, frequently referred to as treeline, has preoccupied biogeographers and ecologists for more than a century. It is widely hypothesized that treelines will advance in response to current and anticipated future temperature increases worldwide. Monitoring of these ecotones is important in light of the potential for change. Equally important is an understanding of past changes so that future changes and their impacts can be forecast. This paper provides an overview of methods that have been used to detect and measure change at forest-tundra ecotones worldwide, with examples drawn from studies of treelines in alpine areas of the subarctic. These methods include resurveys of field plots and transects, repeat photography, dendrochronology, use of historical records, remote sensing, and paleoecological techniques such as palynology and subfossil analysis. The benefits and limitations of each approach are identified and evaluated. It is shown that there is no single best method, largely because each is only capable of resolving change within a specific range of temporal and spatial extents. Multiscale approaches that integrate several methods and techniques provide a more comprehensive picture of change and can be used to identify the variables that influence treeline dynamics and better understand functional mechanisms of response. ¬© 2011 The Author.

Distinctions between recent and fossil samples are shown by frequencies of these four morphotypes only. In case M3 14 morphotypes are revealed on the whole, from them 5 ones are in a significant amount. Distinction of frequencies of morphotypes on the right and left sides are appeared significant for the one morphotype M1 of fossil sample only. The diversity of recent sample of L. lagurus is lower, than mineral, both in case M1, and in case M3. The fossil sample is more complex in comparison with recent, that it is possible to explain colder climatic conditions of Pleistocene in comparison with modern. 25 various variants of combinations of morphotypes both in case M1, and in case M3 are revealed.

211,"A multi-proxy reconstruction of peatland development and regional vegetation changes in subarctic NE Fennoscandia (the Republic of Karelia, Russia) during the Holocene | A better understanding of past long-term environmental changes in the subarctic region is crucial for mitigation of the possible negative effects of climate warming in this vulnerable region. This study provides a new multi-proxy reconstruction of regional vegetation changes and peatland development for north-eastern Fennoscandia (Russia) during most of the Holocene. To that purpose, we performed plant macrofossil, pollen, testate amoebae, peat humification, loss on ignition and radiocarbon analyses of the peat deposits from a mire around Vodoprovodnoe Lake (the Kindo Peninsula, the Republic of Karelia). Our data indicate that the peat deposits started accumulating before 9147 +/- 182 cal. yr. BP. The vegetation cover in the area was mainly typical for the northern taiga zone, except for the period similar to 7800-5600 cal. yr. BP, when it generally resembled the middle taiga zone. The vegetation cover and peatland were greatly affected by reoccurring fires, which can be partly related to human activity. These events were associated with an increased proportion of birch in the vegetation cover (as a pioneer species) and/or water level decreases. By 600 cal. yr. BP, the peatland and the surrounding vegetation reached its current state and only minor changes had been recorded since that time. Overall, our results suggest a considerable and unexpected role of fires in the postglacial dynamics of subarctic peatlands. | ['babeshko', 'fatynina', 'galka', 'krasnova', 'mauquoy', 'mazei', 'mazei', 'payne', 'saldaev', 'severova', 'shkurko', 'tsyganov', 'voronov', 'zazovskaya'] | ","['babeshko', 'fatynina', 'galka', 'krasnova', 'mauquoy', 'mazei', 'mazei', 'payne', 'saldaev', 'severova', 'shkurko', 'tsyganov', 'voronov', 'zazovskaya']",3
212,"Multi-proxy study of soil organic matter dynamics in permafrost peat deposits reveal vulnerability to climate change in the European Russian Arctic | Soil organic carbon (SOC) in permafrost terrain is vulnerable to climate change. Perennially frozen peat deposits store large amounts of SOC, but we know little about its chemical composition and lability. We used plant macrofossil and biomarker analyses to reconstruct the Holocene paleovegetation and paleoenvironmental changes in two peat plateau profiles from the European Russian Arctic. Peat plateaus are the main stores of permafrost soil C in the region, but during most of the Holocene peats developed as permafrost-free rich fens with woody vegetation, sedges and mosses. Around 2200 cal BP, permafrost aggraded at the site resulting in frost heave and a drastic reduction in peat accumulation under the drier uplifted surface conditions. The permafrost dynamics (aggradation, frost-heave and thaw) ushered changes in plant assemblages and carbon accumulation, and consequently in the biomarker trends too. Detailed biomarker analyses indicate abundant neutral lipids, which follow the general pattern: n-alkanols > sterols >= n-alkanes >= triterpenols. The lignin monomers are not as abundant as the lipids and increase with depth. The selected aliphatic and phenolic compounds are source specific, and they have different degrees of lability, which is useful for tracing the impact of permafrost dynamics (peat accumulation and/or decay associated with thawing). However, common interpretation of biomarker patterns, and perceived hydrological and climate changes, must be applied carefully in permafrost regions. The increased proportion (selective preservation) of n-alkanes and lignin is a robust indicator of cumulative decomposition trajectories, which is mirrored by functional compounds (e. g. n-alkanol, triterpenol, and sterol concentrations) showing opposite trends. The distribution of these compounds follows first order decay kinetics, and concurs with the down core diagenetic changes. In particular, some of the biomarker ratios (e. g. stanol/sterol and higher plant alkane index) seem promising for tracing SOC decomposition despite changes in botanical imprint, and sites spanning across different soil types and locations. Carbon accumulation rate calculated at these sites varies from 18.1 to 31.1 gC m(-2) yr(-1), and it's evident selective preservation, molecular complexity of organic compounds, and freezing conditions enhance the long-term stability of SOC. Further, our results suggest that permafrost dynamics strongly impact the more undecomposed SOC that could be rapidly remobilized through ongoing thermokarst expansion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

213,"Multi-scale, integrated approaches to understanding the nature and impact of past environmental and climatic change in the archaeological record, and the role of isotope zooarchaeology | Climatic change, and associated environmental changes, are key challenges facing the world today, and are altering the future of our planet and its inhabitants. Climatic and environmental shifts also had profound effects on human societies in the past, and archaeology has a key role in helping us understand how humans, animals and the broader ecosystem responds and adapts to environmental change. Understanding human-environmental interactions on local, regional, and global scales is therefore not only a key part of better understanding the past, but also for informing the present. A significant area to explore is the palaeoecology of archaeologically-important prey-species, both as a means of more accurately reconstructing ancient landscapes and ecosystems, but also for better understanding past human activity, landscape use and faunal resource exploitation. New biomolecular approaches, and particularly isotope zooarchaeology, have enhanced our ability to reconstruct past ecosystem dynamics, paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions, and the economic strategies that humans used to cope with them. However, the integration of multiple lines of evidence and methodologies remains the most powerful approach towards studying environmental change, resilience and adaptation in the past, not only for the benefit of archaeologists but other specialists. This special section of Journal of Archaeological Science Reports draws together papers using a range of methodologies to understand past human interactions with their environments, from Alaska, to Coastal Brazil, Europe and beyond. Studies are on a range of scales, from individual sites to big data, multi-site analyses, and encompass periods from Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages. Given the multi-faceted nature of the human past, archaeologists need to use a broad range of datasets to best understand environmental change and its impact on humans and animals. By drawing on inter-disciplinary specialisations and working alongside experts from other fields it will be possible to gain a more integrated and complete understanding of the ecological, economic, social and cultural effects of climatic and environmental changes on past populations. | ['britton', 'jones'] | ","['britton', 'jones']",0

215,"A multitracer study of peat profiles from Tunguska, Siberia | Two peat columns from Tunguska (Siberia) were analysed for pollen, spores, charcoal, trace elements and gamma-emitters in order to identify the fingerprints of the impact of a still unidentified cosmic body (TCB), which occurred in the summer of 1908, and the level of environmental pollution in a background area of central Siberia. Peat layers were subject to non-destructive gamma-ray spectrometry to derive radiochronology by the excess Pb-210 method. The age-to-depth relationship was crosschecked by using both 1963 horizon of Cs-137 associated to maximum global fallout deposition and palynological data profiles. Vertical distributions of trace elements in the peat columns were obtained by PIXE multielemental analysis allowing determination of the levels of environmental contamination in a background region of the Siberian taiga. The association of heavy metals such as Ni, Co and Cu in the profiles suggests the connection of the area with mining and metal smelting activity in the north of the region through atmospheric circulation. As concerns global scale contamination, the inventory of the artificial radionuclide Cs-137 (4.6 kBq m(-2)) shows a value typical of remote slightly contaminated areas resulting from global scale redistribution of radioactive fallout from Cold War nuclear weapon testing. The atmospheric inventory of the natural radionuclide Pb-210, for which a mean annual flux of 200 Bq m(-2) yr(-1) has been calculated, is typical of continental regions. The influence of Tunguska Cosmic Body in the peat is recognizable by a large discontinuity in the palynological profile of the peat monolith at a depth coinciding with the 1908 layer as determined by the Pb-210 technique, showing a large peak of total pollen counting attributed to the impact of the shockwave on the area in which huge tree stands were destroyed. Following the event, tree pollen concentration decreases abruptly showing the temporary inception of a mire environment with an increase of Sphagnum spore concentrations. Results of elemental analysis so far available do not show anomalies in the concentration profiles at depths coinciding with the Tunguska event layer indicating the need for pre-concentration technique enabling the detection of element associations typical of extraterrestrial materials.

217,"The myth of the classic hydrosere model of bog succession | The classic hydrosere model of bog succession proposes that infilling of a shallow lake or pond by organic sediments produces a sequence of vegetation communities beginning with a marsh community of aquatic plants such as sedges, followed by a bog community composed mainly of Sphagnum mosses and ericaceous shrubs, and culminating in a mature upland or mesic 'climax' forest. An examination of the literature indicates, however, that this model is based almost solely on observations of spatial zonation of vegetation around infilling water bodies. No studies can be found which contain clear quantitative evidence of successional pathways progressing from bog to upland forest. Indeed, numerous studies conclude that patterns of hydrosere succession are not consistent with the classic hydrosere model. Forest age structure, peat stratigraphy, and radiocarbon data presented from two bogs in Schefferville, Quebec, Canada, suggest that many bogs in this region, and elsewhere as indicated in the literature, are climax communities formed via both infilling of a water body (terrestrialization) and expansion of bogs into upland forests (paludification). An alternative model of hydrosere succession based on the bog climax hypothesis is presented. | ['klinger'] | ",['klinger'],0

219,"A near annual record of recent tree-line dynamics from northern Finland | Some 2500 years of vegetation history are revealed through pollen analysis of a peat profile from Kevo in northernmost Finland. The aim of the investigation was to see if it is possible to obtain an annual pollen accumulation record from peats (comparable to those potentially obtainable from laminated lake sediments) to use as a proxy climate record and correlate with the local dendrochronological record. Two closely located peat profiles are analysed and the results compared with those from an adjacent pollen trap which has been monitoring pollen deposition continuously since AD 1982. An age-depth chronology is established for one of the peat profiles by wiggle-matching a series of AMS 14C dates with the atmospheric 14C curve around the ""bomb peak"", and then transferred to the second profile. By this means the depth location of individual years is obtained for the period AD 1872 to 1996. Pollen concentration is calculated for consecutive 2mm slices of peat down to a depth of 10 cm and the values converted to annual pollen accumulation rates using the age-depth chronology. Betula and Pinus are seen to have dominated the vegetation throughout the time covered by the profile. An interval of disturbance caused by fire followed by grazing is visible in the pollen record and dated to the very early years of 20th century. The gradual regeneration of pine after this fire and the fluctuating history of birch due to a series of defoliation attacks by Epirrita autumnata is also visible. It is concluded that, although it is possible to obtain a near-annual temporal resolution for the pollen record in this way, it is not possible to slice the peat in such a way that individual calendar years can be extracted which would give a clear year by year pollen or climate signal. Pollen accumulation rates for the individual tree taxa, however, do agree with the values predicted for presence/absence and degree of abundance of these species on the basis of pollen trap monitoring. | ['goslar', 'hick', 'van', 'der', 'borg'] | ","['goslar', 'hick', 'van', 'der', 'borg']",0
220,"Near-surface permafrost aggradation in Northern Hemisphere peatlands shows regional and global trends during the past 6000 years | The history of permafrost aggradation and thaw in northern peatlands can serve as an indicator of regional climatic history in regions where records are sparse. We infer regional trends in the timing of permafrost aggradation and thaw in North American and Eurasian peatland ecosystems based on plant macrofossils and peat properties using existing peat core records from more than 250 cores. Results indicate that permafrost was continuously present in peatlands during the last 6000 years in some present-day continuous permafrost zones and formed after 6000 BP in peatlands in the isolated to discontinuous permafrost regions. Rates of permafrost aggradation in peatlands generally increased after 3000 BP and were greatest between 750 and 0 BP, corresponding with neoglacial cooling and the Little Ice Age (LIA), respectively. Peak periods of permafrost thaw occurred after 250 BP, when permafrost aggradation in peatlands reached its maximum extent and as temperatures began warming after the LIA, suggesting that permafrost thaw is likely to continue in the future. The broader correlation of permafrost aggradation in peatlands with known climatic trends and other proxies such as pollen records suggests that this record can be a valuable addition to regional climate reconstructions. | ['jones', 'treat'] | ","['jones', 'treat']",3
221,"Neolithic population crash in northwest Europe associated with agricultural crisis | The focus of this paper is the Neolithic of northwest Europe, where a rapid growth in population between similar to 5950 and similar to 5550 cal yr BP is followed by a decline that lasted until similar to 4950 cal yr BP. The timing of the increase in population density correlates with the local appearance of farming and is attributed to the advantageous effects of agriculture. However, the subsequent population decline has yet to be satisfactorily explained. One possible explanation is the reduction in yields in Neolithic cereal-based agriculture due to worsening climatic conditions. The suggestion of a correlation between Neolithic climate deterioration, agricultural productivity, and a decrease in population requires testing for northwestern Europe. Data for our analyses were collected during the Cultural Evolution of Neolithic Europe project. We assess the correlation between agricultural productivity and population densities in the Neolithic of northwest Europe by examining the changing frequencies of crop and weed taxa before, during and after the population ""boom and bust.""

223,"Nonstationary spatio-temporal small rodent dynamics: evidence from long-term Norwegian fox bounty data | The geographical pattern in Fennoscandian small rodent population dynamics with a southern noncyclic and a northern cyclic region, and with latitudinal gradients in density-dependent structure, cycle period length and spatial synchrony within the northern cyclic region, has been widely publicized and interpreted in the ecological literature. However, the time-series data on which these inferences have been established are relatively short and originate from a specific time period (mostly around 1970-90). Hence, it can be questioned whether the geographical population dynamics patterns are consistent over time (i.e. whether they are stationary).Here we analyse an almost century long (1880-1976) panel of fox bounty time series including 18 counties of Norway, thus spanning the whole range of latitudes of Fennoscandia (i.e. 15 latitudinal degrees). These fox time series mirror the dynamics of their dominant small rodent prey, in particular, with respect to cycle period length and spatial synchrony.While we found some evidence consistent with previous analyses showing a clearly patterned dynamics according to latitude, such patterns were not stationary on a longer time-scale. In particular, we observed a shift from an extensively synchronous (i.e. regionalized) 4-year cycle north of 60 degrees N just after the 'Little Ice Age' (1880-1910) to a diversification of cycle period length (3-5 years) and eventually, partial loss of cyclicity and synchronicity in later periods. Incidents of loss of cyclicity appeared to be preceded by changes in cycle period (i.e. period lengthening and shortening).These results show that the dynamics of Fennoscandian small rodents, and their associated guild of predators, are more prone to change than previously acknowledged. | ['henden', 'ims', 'yoccoz'] | ","['henden', 'ims', 'yoccoz']",3
224,"Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillation phase changes are recorded in the isotopes (Œ¥18O and Œ¥13C) of Cassiope tetragona plants | The Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations (AO/NAO) are large-scale annual modes of atmospheric circulation that have shifted in the last 30 years. Recent changes in arctic climate, including increasing surface air temperature, declining sea ice extent, and shifts in the amounts seasonality of precipitation are linked to the strong positive phase of the AO/NAO. Here, we show that phase changes in the AO/NAO are recorded in the isotopic (Œ¥18O and Œî-carbon isotope discrimination) characteristics of the long-lived circum-arctic plant, Cassiope tetragona, as summer rain has become a more important water source than snowmelt water which in turn has lead to decreases in Œî and reductions in plant stem growth. These isotopic records in C. tetragona may facilitate reconstructions of climate, plant-soil water relations, plant gas exchange attributes and a mechanistic understanding of growth responses to shifts in atmospheric circulation.

225,"Northern Host-Parasite Assemblages. History and Biogeography on the Borderlands of Episodic Climate and Environmental Transition | Diversity among assemblages of mammalian hosts and parasites in northern terrestrial ecosystems was structured by a deep history of biotic and abiotic change that overlies a complex geographic arena. Since the Pliocene, Holarctic ecosystems assembled in response to shifting climates (glacial and interglacial stages). Cycles of episodic dispersal/isolation and diversification defined northern diversity on landscape to regional scales. Episodes of geographic expansion and colonisation linked Eurasia and North America across Beringia and drove macroevolutionary structure of host and parasite associations. Asynchronous dispersal from centres of origin in Eurasia into the Nearctic resulted in gradients in parasite diversity in the carnivoran, lagomorph, rodent and artiodactyl assemblages we reviewed. Recurrent faunal interchange and isolation in conjunction with episodes of host colonisation have produced a mosaic structure for parasite faunas and considerable cryptic diversity among nematodes and cestodes. Mechanisms of invasion and geographic colonisation leading to the establishment of complex faunal assemblages are equivalent in evolutionary and ecological time, as demonstrated by various explorations of diversity in these high-latitude systems. Our ability to determine historical responses to episodic shifts in global climate may provide a framework for predicting the cascading effects of contemporary environmental change. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. | ['cook', 'galbreath', 'hoberg', 'kutz', 'polley'] | ","['cook', 'galbreath', 'hoberg', 'kutz', 'polley']",3
226,"Nutrient enrichment in the High Arctic associated with Thule Inuit whalers: a paleolimnological investigation from Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada) | Cultural eutrophication is one of several environmental stressors that represents a significant ecological threat as the human population continues to grow and encroach on aquatic ecosystems. However, until recently, the environmental impacts of ancient human populations that had low population densities were thought to be largely insignificant relative to those of post-industrial urban society. Based on paleolimnological and archeological data, we have shown that Thule Inuit whalers living in small, nomadic communities were altering High Arctic pond ecology centuries before industrialization. Changes in diatom species assemblage and spectrally inferred aquatic primary production indicate a period of increased production in a pond (E-Knud) on Knud Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, which can be linked to the effects of the Thule from about 810-340 years ago. This site is near the northernmost region of past Thule occupation. Input of nutrients from bowhead whale carcasses, used by the Thule Inuit for sustenance and the construction of winter settlements, as well as other Thule activities (e.g., sealing, human waste, etc.), resulted in an increase in delta N-15, which coincided with ecologically significant diatom abundance changes, including an increase in Amphora ovalis. Diatom and nutrient changes also coincided with increased primary aquatic production, as measured by spectrally inferred chlorophyll a concentration. In addition, we recorded relative increases in diatom taxa such as Craticula halophila and Achnanthidum minutissimum in the more recent sediments, which we attribute to recent climate warming, manifested by lower water levels and associated evapo-concentration. Specific conductivities recorded during three sampling years (2004, 2006, 2009) show a trend of increasing conductivity in pond E-Knud in response to declining water levels. Together these changes in diatom species abundance suggest that multiple environmental stressors, operating several centuries apart, have led to marked limnological changes in E-Knud pond. | ['blais', 'douglas', 'hadley', 'smol'] | ","['blais', 'douglas', 'hadley', 'smol']",3
227,"Orbital forcing and role of the latitudinal insolation/temperature gradient | Orbital forcing of the climate system is clearly shown in the Earths record of glacial-interglacial cycles, but the mechanism underlying this forcing is poorly understood. Traditional Milankovitch theory suggests that these cycles are driven by changes in high latitude summer insolation, yet this forcing is dominated by precession, and cannot account for the importance of obliquity in the Ice Age record. Here, we investigate an alternative forcing based on the latitudinal insolation gradient (LIG), which is dominated by both obliquity (in summer) and precession (in winter). The insolation gradient acts on the climate system through differential solar heating, which creates the Earths latitudinal temperature gradient (LTG) that drives the atmospheric and ocean circulation. A new pollen-based reconstruction of the LTG during the Holocene is used to demonstrate that the LTG may be much more sensitive to changes in the LIG than previously thought. From this, it is shown how LIG forcing of the LTG may help explain the propagation of orbital signatures throughout the climate system, including the Monsoon, Arctic Oscillation and ocean circulation. These relationships are validated over the last (Eemian) Interglacial, which occurred under a different orbital configuration to the Holocene. We conclude that LIG forcing of the LTG explains many criticisms of classic Milankovitch theory, while being poorly represented in climate models. | ['brewer', 'davis'] | ","['brewer', 'davis']",3
228,"Origin and significance of subarctic patchy podzolic soils and paleosols | Patchy podzolic soil and paleosol profiles are composed of discontinuous but closely imbricated, multicolored A and B horizons, in the form of more or less discrete 3- to 10-cm-long patches. These soils are either modem soils or paleosols developed in subarctic sites on eolian, fluvial, marine, or fluvioglacial mediums and deposits. The particular conditions for the inception of patchy horizons are probably the large amount of snow (80-150 cm) accumulated by forest or krummholz vegetation and its melting and percolation in a frozen, but nonicy (dry) soil. The pedogenic activities of patchy podzolic profiles probably occur during snowmelt, i.e. the period of the growing season of maximum water supply, indicating that these poorly developed soils are a direct response to xeric site conditions prevailing during most of the growing season. Because patchy soil profiles also occurred in the past, the ecological history of past xeric environments may be inferred, particularly from eolian paleosol sequences. In northern Quebec, the dune paleosols analyzed suggest the prevalence of boreal-like soil conditions before 4200 BP and of subarctic soil conditions after this period in the southern part of the Forest-Tundra. The absence of pedogenic development after 1000 BP in the northern part of the Forest-Tundra is evidence for a lack of water supply associated with a postfire shift from lichen-spruce (snowrich) to lichen-heath (snowfree) vegetation. Patchy paleosol profiles appear as a useful tool for the reconstruction of Holocene and Pleistocene environments in high-latitude areas. | ['filion', 'payette'] | ","['filion', 'payette']",3
229,"Ornithogenic vegetation: How significant has the seabird influence been on the Aleutian Island vegetation during the Holocene? | In the Aleutian Islands during the Holocene, terrestrial predators were actually absent; as a result, large seabird colonies thrived along the coasts or across entire islands. Bird guano enriches the soil with nitrogen, which can lead to the formation of highly modified ornithogenic (bird-formed) ecosystems. For a more detailed investigation of avian influence, we reconstructed more than 10,000-year-old vegetation dynamics of the coast of Shemya Island (Near Islands) by pollen analysis. At the initial stages of vegetation development (10,000-4,600 cal year BP), sedge-heather tundra grew in the studied area. A seabird colony existed on Shemya from 4,600 to 2,400 cal year BP according to stable isotope analysis. During a period of at least 2,200 years, nitrogen enrichment led to the development of ornithogenic herb meadows with a high presence of Apiaceae. A long-term increase in delta 15N above 9-10 parts per thousand led to radical shifts in vegetation. Noticeable reduction of seabird colonies due to human hunting led to grass-meadows spreading. After a prolonged decrease delta 15N below 9-10 parts per thousand (2,400 cal year BP to present), there was a shift toward less productive sedge-tundra communities.

230,"An overview of late Holocene climate and environmental change inferred from Arctic lake sediment | The 14 papers in this Special Issue of the Journal of Paleolimnology report new records of Holocene climate and environmental change from Arctic lakes, with emphasis on the last 2000 years. The study sites span the high latitudes of North America and extend into northwestern Europe. The studies rely on multiple proxy indicators to reconstruct past climate, including: varve thicknesses, chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, biogenic-silica and organic-matter content, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms, and the frequency of lake-ice-rafted aggregates. These proxies primarily document changes in past summer temperatures, the main control on physical and biological processes in lakes at high latitudes. The records will be integrated into a larger network of paleoclimate sites to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of climate change and to compare the paleoclimate inferences with the output of general circulation models. | ['kaufman'] | ",['kaufman'],3
231,"Oxygen isotope variations of phosphate in mammalian bone and tooth enamel | About eighty specimens from ten different species of mammals, collected from different areas under different climatic and environmental conditions, were measured for the oxygen isotopic composition of their bone and tooth phosphate. The equations relating these values to the mean oxygen isotopic composition of local meteoric water were also derived. The same equation can be used for goats, roe-bucks, and mouflons, despite the biological differences among these species. Measurements were made on about fourty different specimens of rabbit and hare from Europe, Africa, and Canada, but in this case the data obtained clearly show no direct relationship between the oxygen isotopic composition of local meteoric water and the isotopic composition of the skeletal phosphate. However, there seems to be an inverse relationship between the relative humidity of the studied areas and the Œ¥ 18O(PO43-) of the skeletal phosphate, thus suggesting the use of fossil bones of these mammal species as recorders of palaeoenvironmental relative humidity. Finally, a new equation was derived for the isotopic scale for horses, on the basis of all the previous data and of a few newly obtained results. ¬© 1995. | ['delgado', 'huertas', 'iacumin', 'longinelli', 'stenni', 's√°nchez', 'chill√≥n'] | ","['delgado', 'huertas', 'iacumin', 'longinelli', 'stenni', 's√°nchez', 'chill√≥n']",1
232,"Palaeoecological, biogeographical and palaeoclimatological implications of early Holocene immigration of Larix sibirica Ledeb. into the Scandes Mountains, Sweden | For the first time, Holocene macroremains (cones and wood) of Larix sibirica Ledeb., radiocarbon dated between 8700 and 7500 BP, have been recovered from two sites in the Scandes Mountains of Sweden. The sites are separated by >300 km and lie in the present subalpine and low alpine belts, respectively. Existing pollen-stratigraphical records have not suggested the presence of Larix in the Holocene beyond its present range, i.e. >1000 km to the east in Russia. Hence, the pollen analytical method should be used more cautiously when inferring subcontinental-continental biogeographical dynamics. It appears that Larix immigrated rapidly by long-distance jump dispersal soon after the deglaciation. The same pattern has emerged for Picea abies (L.) Karst. and some thermophilous broadleaved tree species. This might be a more general mechanism for tree spread during the early Holocene. Step-wise migration and migrational lags could be quite unimportant elements within tree paleobiogeography. This increases the prospects for interpretation of long-term and large-scale changes in plant cover performance in terms of expansion/decline relative to climatic change. Today, Larix sibirica prospers in continental climates with extremely cold winters, thus it is reasonable to infer that early-Holocene winters in western Fennoscandia could have been similar to, or slightly colder than those of today. This contention conflicts with previously published simulations using General Circulation Models, pollen-climate response surfaces and other retrospective devices, which suggest a strongly oceanic climate with winters >2degreeC warmer than present. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],3
233,"Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes in north-west Europe: Climatic implications and the human dimension | Holocene climate changes and variability in Europe are outlined on three time scales: long-term changes throughout the period as a whole; shorter-term fluctuations at centennial to millennial scales; and events with an annual to multi-decadal duration. Human population history in Europe during the Holocene is considered in relation to this history of climatic change and variability; in particular, evidence is reviewed that may indicate that human populations responded to, and perhaps also contributed to, climatic changes. The limitations of the data sources and chronological techniques available are briefly outlined. The prevalent long-term pattern is one of relatively warmer conditions during the early to mid-Holocene, temperature subsequently declining towards its present values. Superimposed upon this pattern, however, are marked spatial patterns in the strength of the overall changes, as well as evidence that temperature seasonality varied systematically during the Holocene. No clear patterns in precipitation change emerge at the scale of Europe as a whole; long-term precipitation changes varied both between regions and between seasons. The extent to which human populations responded to these long-term changes, in particular through changes in agricultural practices or settlement patterns, is a matter of ongoing debate. At centennial to millennial scales, numerous independent palaeoclimate sensors provide evidence of variability, with some fluctuations being recorded by many different sensors. A marked cooling event at ca. 8.2 ka BP is widely recorded. Although other fluctuations correlate with less certainty between sensors, a common pattern emerges from many of these records. There is some evidence that these fluctuations may be periodic in character. Although chronological limitations generally preclude making definitive links between records of human populations and those of climatic fluctuations, there are notable coincidences between dates for archaeological events and for climatic fluctuations. In the more recent period, however, especially the last millennium, the link is quite secure between the climatic fluctuations of the 'Mediaeval Warm Period' and 'Little Ice Age', and impacts upon human populations. At the shortest time scales, annual to multi-decadal events are recorded in tree rings and other records that offer annual resolution. The most striking of these events are dramatic, albeit generally short-lived, cooling events; furthermore, at least some of these events were apparently global in extent. Although the cause of these events remains a matter of debate, it seems most probable that they reflect catastrophic events of some nature that resulted in substantial quantities of material being injected into the upper atmosphere, thus reducing penetration of solar radiation for a period of years to a decade or more. Some of these events appear to be recorded in human mythology, and it is apparent that they have often coincided with major events in human history. Although much remains to be discovered, and much further research is required, it is apparent that human populations have been affected by climatic change, variability and events during the Holocene. It is also apparent that, when considered in the context of the Holocene, the twentieth century period of increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and of the onset of consequent global climatic warming, is anomalous. The predicted rate and magnitude of twenty first century global mean temperature increase will probably exceed anything experienced during the Holocene. | ['baillie', 'grove', 'hammer', 'harrison', 'huntley', 'jacomet', 'jansen', 'karlen', 'koc', 'luterbacher', 'negendank', 'schibler'] | ","['baillie', 'grove', 'hammer', 'harrison', 'huntley', 'jacomet', 'jansen', 'karlen', 'koc', 'luterbacher', 'negendank', 'schibler']",3
234,"Palaeolimnological and sedimentary responses to Holocene forest retreat in the Scandes Mountains, west-central Sweden | A suite of analyses was performed on sediments accumulated during the last 10 700 years in Lake Spaime, a small, hydrologically open water body in the modern alpine tundra zone of the Scandes Mountains, west-central Sweden. The study aimed to evaluate (1) the nature of climate changes that forced the late-Holocene lowering of altitudinal tree limit in the region, the timing of which is known from prior studies based on radiocarbon dating of subfossil wood, and (2) the impact of these vegetational changes on an aquatic ecosystem. Arboreal pollen and plant macrofossil data confirm the persistence of trees in the lake catchment at least from c. 9700 cal. BP until c. 3700 cal. BP. Although growing-season temperature is commonly believed to be the dominant factor driving boreal forest tree-limit variations in the region, a chironomid-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature suggests that local deforestation during the late Holocene was not accompanied by a significant cooling. The tree-limit retreat was more likely caused by increasing effective moisture and declining length of the growing season. The ecohydrological response of Lake Spaime to this combination of climate and vegetational changes included a decline in primary productivity, as indicated by an abrupt decrease in sediment organic matter content, while associated increases in organic delta(13)C, delta(15)N and C/N point to diminished fluxes and altered balance of catchment-derived nutrients following deforestation. The decline in aquatic productivity is also marked by a distinct change in the mineral magnetic properties, from a high magnetic concentration assemblage dominated by fine-grained magnetite of biogenic origin to one dominated by background levels of coarse-grained detrital magnetite. | ['barnekow', 'bergman', 'edward', 'hammarlund', 'holmgren', 'lamme', 'possnert', 'snowball', 'velle', 'wohlfarth', 'wolfe'] | ","['barnekow', 'bergman', 'edward', 'hammarlund', 'holmgren', 'lamme', 'possnert', 'snowball', 'velle', 'wohlfarth', 'wolfe']",3
235,"A palaeolimnological test of the influence of Norway spruce (Picea abies) immigration on lake-water acidity | The effect of recent land use and subsequent vegetation changes per se on surface-water acidity is difficult to ascertain because of the complicating factor of enhanced levels of anthropogenic acid deposition that occurs at the same time as land-use changes. Expansion of conifers is a major contemporary vegetation change in Sweden and other countries. The immigration of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) into Sweden about 3000 years ago provides, however, a suitable means of assessing the acidification ability of spruce per se on surface waters. Pollen analysis was used to identify the arrival of spruce in the catchments of eight acid-sensitive Swedish boreal-forest lakes. pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were inferred from diatom assemblages for time periods covering some hundred years before and after the establishment of spruce. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess whether catchment vegetation had significant effects on the diatom assemblages. At four sites there were significant changes in the diatom assemblages associated with the arrival of spruce, but none of the lakes acidified. At three sites, however, diatom- inferred DOC increased with the arrival of spruce, probably as a result of the accumulation of raw humus. ¬© 1994, Sage Publications.

236,"Paleoecological assessment of cladoceran community dynamics in two subarctic peatlands | Crustacean community structure and dynamics are very well studied in lakes, rivers and oceanic systems but wetlands, where moisture conditions fluctuate, have not received equal attention in research. For example, cladoceran communities in peatland systems in the subarctic region have not been fully investigated. We used paleolimnological and paleoecological methods to study plant and cladoceran assemblages and the community dynamics in two subarctic peatlands, which differ in their hydrological characteristics. At the first site, Iitto, river floods introduce planktonic species to fen pools and the steep topography of the catchment induces rapid but relatively short flooding periods. Fluctuating environmental conditions result in a high amount of cladoceran resting stages in the samples. At the other site, Kaamanen, the cladoceran assemblage goes through clear directional changes, which could be attributed to changes in fen hydrology and ultimately to climatic changes during the past two millennia. | ['leppanen', 'li', 'piilo', 'valiranta', 'zhang'] | ","['leppanen', 'li', 'piilo', 'valiranta', 'zhang']",3
237,"Paleoecology of an early holocene wetland on the Canadian Prairies | A plant macrofossil record from the glacial Lake Hind basin is used to reconstruct early postglaciall wetland plant succession and paleohydrology Between > 10.6 and 9.1 ka BP, there are four plant assemblage zones: (1) an early (>10.6 ka BP) zone dominated by Cyperaceae and aquatics; (2) a subsequent zone (‚àº10.6-10.1 ka BP) with emergents (Menyanthes trifoliata, Potentilla palustris, Scirpus validus) and fewer aquatic plants; (3) an interval between ‚àº10.1 and 9.8 ka BP dominated by Drepanocladus aduncus; and (4) a zone between ‚àº9.8 and 9.1 ka BP with Menyanthes trifoliata and Equisetum. These data indicate a gradual decline in water depth between 10.6 and 10.1 ka BP due to deepening of one or more outlets of glacial Lake Hind. From ‚àº10.6 to 9.1 ka BP, the importance of Menyanthes records pronounced, seasonal, flooding. Furthermore, lack of evidence for complete drawdown and terrestrialization in the basin - despite local and regional evidence for postglacial warming - indicates that this wetland was minimally impacted by climate change up to at least 9.1 ka BP. Persistence of very wet conditions locally is consistent with recent results from south-central Saskatchewan, and may be due to release of meltwater from stagnant ice. However, frequent low-energy flooding of the basin by the Souris River is more plausible. In general, the apparent insensitivity of aquatic habitats to abrupt climate change in some locales on the Canadian Prairies demonstrates the potential long-term mitigating effects of local hydrological factors. | ['boyd'] | ",['boyd'],4
238,"A Paleoindian response to Younger Dryas climate change | Late Quaternary changes in North American vegetation and geography reflect the influence of changing climate induced by the retreating ice sheets, orbitally-driven seasonal insolation patterns, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, and relatively rapid internal variations. At regional scales, these climate changes resulted in ecosystem variability that impacted human access to resources. We use paleoenvironmental and archaeological records from 14,000 to 10,000 cal yr BP for New England and Maritime Canada (NE/M) to propose the impact of rapid climate change on human resource-procurement and technology. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions for the Younger Dryas chronozone (YDC; 12,900-11,600 cal yr BP) show ecologic responses to colder-than-earlier conditions. At roughly the same time (13,000-11,000 cal yr BP), we surmise that fluted points were used to hunt large mammals, including caribou, which inhabited regions with sub-arctic-like vegetation. Environmental changes, associated with rapid regional warming at the end of the YDC, coincided with the abandonment of fluting technology. As conditions warmed, vegetation changes led to shifts in animal populations, which may be reflected in the development of other point styles by Paleoindians and subsequent human groups.

239,"Paleolimnological records of climatic change in North America | Lacustrine fossil records provide long time series of data on limnological and climatic conditions; these data are useful for establishing natural patterns of climate variability and for generating testable hypotheses about atmospheric circulation and climate-ecosystem linkages. Shoreline features can indicate past lake-level fluctuations that may reflect changes in moisture balance, but often these records are discontinuous and are evidence of only extreme conditions. The organisms, geochemistry, and sedimentology of lake sediments may provide a more continuous sequence of direct and indirect lake-climate interactions in the past. The most clearly interpretable paleolimnological records of climatic change are those that use several lines of evidence to corroborate a climatic hypothesis and are from sites near an ecotone or in regions of extreme climate. In all cases, hydrologic setting mediates a lake's response to climate and must be considered in interpreting sedimentary sequences. | ['fritz'] | ",['fritz'],1
240,"Paleolimnological reconstruction of Holocene climatic trends from two boreal treeline lakes, Northwest Territories, Canada | Paleolimnological analyses of two lakes located near the northern treeline in the central part of the Canadian Northwest Territories document a history of abrupt postglacial climatic and limnological changes. A diatom-based transfer function, based on weighted-averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) techniques, was used to give quantitative estimates of past trends in lakewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a limnological variable strongly aligned with catchment vegetation and soils. The diatom record from the sediment cores provides evidence for profound limnologic change during the mid-Holocene, corresponding to maximum forest-tundra development between 5000 and 3000 14C yr BP in both Queen's and Toronto lakes, with a diatom-inferred relative change in lakewater DOC of up to 5.8 mg L-1 between the mid-Holocene and the present-day. Comparison of the diatom-inferred environmental changes with other proxy data (pollen, stable isotopes) from the same lakes provides strong evidence for an episode of climatic amelioration and lake responses to the associated vegetational changes (from tundra to forest-tundra) at sites near the central Canadian treeline. This study illustrates the usefulness of diatoms as quantitative indicators of past climate-related environmental change in northern treeline regions, and implies that aquatic ecosystems at high latitudes might respond with extreme sensitivity to climate warming. | ['macdonald', 'pienitz', 'smol'] | ","['macdonald', 'pienitz', 'smol']",3
241,"A Peat-Producing Empetrum Heath in Coastal North Norway | A conspicuous type of heath dominated by Empetrum hermaphroditum has been investigated in the western coastal region of Troms, northern Norway (70.degree.N, 20.degree.E). The soil of the Empetrum heath lacks mineral soil horizons and podsol development. Instead, a peat profile up to 1 m has accumulated, which resembles the pedology of ombrotrophic bogs rather than the other Empetrum-dominated communities in northern Norway. The high peat accumulation rate in this heath is probably a response to the cold and wet climate, the retarded metabolism of the carbon supply in the soil, and, possibly, allelopatic properties of Empetrum. The heath type is classified as Pleurozio-Empetretum hermaphrodti Ovst. nov. ass. within the alliance Phyllodoco-Vaccinion myrtilli Nordh. 43. Several species with a coastal distribution pattern are associated with this community. Palynological investigation indicates that one stand of this association has been stable, lacking Betula, for about 1400 yr. For this reason we believe that exposure to strong winds and sea spray, rather than grazing is the primary factor preventing the establishment of Betula. This hypothesis is supported by the relatively high content of magnesium in the soil. The Empetrum heath is regarded as the climax community of convex siliceous habitats near the sea in the investigation area. | ['edvardsen', 'elvebakk', 'ovstedal', 'prosch', 'danielsen', 'schwenke', 'sveistrup'] | ","['edvardsen', 'elvebakk', 'ovstedal', 'prosch', 'danielsen', 'schwenke', 'sveistrup']",0
242,"Peatland development at the arctic tree line (Quebec, Canada) influenced by flooding and permafrost | In this study, we documented the Holocene history of a peat plateau at the arctic tree line in northern Quebec using stratigraphic and macrofossil analyses to highlight the effects of geomorphic setting in peatland development. Paludification of the site began about 6800 cal yr BP. From 6390 to 4120 cal yr Bp, the peatland experienced a series of flooding events. The location of the peatland in a depression bounded by two small lakes likely explains its sensitivity to runoff. The proximity of a large hill bordering the peatland to the south possibly favored the inflow of mineral-laden water. The onset of permafrost aggradation in several parts of the peatland occurred after 3670 cal yr BP. Uplifting of the peatland surface caused by permafrost stopped the flooding. According to radiocarbon dating of the uppermost peat layers, permafrost distribution progressed from the east to the west of the peatland, indicating differential timing for the initiation of permafrost throughout the peatland. Most of the peatland was affected by permafrost growth during the Little lee Age. Picea mariana macroremains at 6450 cal yr BP indicate that the species was present during the early stages of peatland development, which occurred soon after the sea regression.

Mountain regions could potentially provide safe sites for arctic-alpine plants in a warmer climate, but empirical evidence is fragmentary.

We provide robust evidence of long-term persistence of arctic-alpine plants through large-magnitude climate changes but document a decline in their diversity during a past expansion of woody vegetation. Nevertheless, most of the plants that were present during the last glacial interval, including all of the arctic-alpines, are still found in the region today.

The diet of pine marten was diverse, and largely followed the abundance of food. Microtines were the most important prey, but in the absence of microtines, martens increased the relative consumption of some alternative prey. Among adult martens, total food consumption, body condition, and reproductive success did not follow microtine density. There were some indications of food shortage among juveniles, but the data was not consistent in this respect. No numerical response to microtine cycles could be proven. Predation from red fox (Vulpes vulpes) may have been a major mortality factor for pine marten. The increase in marten numbers in the 1980's could be linked both spatially and chronologically to a decline in the fox population. | ['helldin'] | ",['helldin'],1
246,"Plants in arctic environments | From a biological perspective, there is no universally accepted definition of the Arctic, but Arctic plants are generally considered to be those living in tundra and polar deserts beyond the northern climatic limits of forests, i.e., generally north of the boreal zone. The boundary between boreal forests and the Arctic is often broad and ambiguous. Arctic plants exist along a global continuum of decreasing floristic diversity with increasing latitude. This gradient starts well outside of the Arctic and continues within the Arctic to the northernmost reaches of land. Arctic plants come in a wide variety of forms. Mosses, lichens, and low- growing woody and herbaceous perennials characterize Arctic vegetation. Trees, succulents, ferns, and annual plants are rare or absent from most Arctic plant communities. Combinations of mosses, lichens, sedges, grasses, and dwarf woody shrubs dominate most Arctic tundra, and miniature flowering plants dominate the polar deserts. Adaptations of Arctic plants to cold and short growing seasons as well as other aspects of their physical environment are evident in their morphologies, physiologies, and life histories. Arctic plants are also adapted to their biotic environment Extremely low temperatures are less characteristic of the Arctic than they are of some other regions, but the Arctic is consistently cold, resulting in permafrost and direct and indirect environmental challenges to plants. During short growing seasons Arctic plants utilize seasonally thawed soils above the permafrost and tolerate frozen soils in winter. Low temperatures affect the availability of mineral nutrients, frequently limiting the growth and productivity of Arctic plants. Usable soil is limited by permafrost, and low temperatures retard soil genesis, microbial activity, and uptake by roots. Birds and mammals play a key role in nutrient redistribution and the creation of local sites with high fertility. Arctic vegetation patterns are closely correlated with moisture and steep local moisture gradients are characteristic of the Arctic. Although the Arctic is climatologically a desert, few Arctic plants experience water stress. Moisture affects thermal characteristics and oxygenation of soils, which in turn affects decomposition rates and the availability of mineral nutrients. Patterns of moisture are strongly influenced by topography due to the combined effects of low precipitation, low evaporation, and water ponding due to permafrost. Mechanical stresses associated with freezing and thawing of soils and substrates shape the habitats of Arctic plants. Geomorphic processes unique to cold regions produce vegetational patterns and can lead to cyclic plant succession. The climate of the Arctic is dynamic, and changes in past plant communities have occurred on a wide variety of time scales. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to anticipate the effects of a changing climate on the Arctic due to the diversity of plants and habitats and due to nonlinear interactions between environmental factors within Arctic ecosystems. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014. | ['peterson'] | ",['peterson'],3
247,"A pollen-based biome reconstruction over the last 3.562 million years in the Far East Russian Arctic - new insights into climate-vegetation relationships at the regional scale | The recent and fossil pollen data obtained under the frame of the multi-disciplinary international El'gygytgyn Drilling Project represent a unique archive, which allows the testing of a range of pollen-based reconstruction approaches and the deciphering of changes in the regional vegetation and climate. In the current study we provide details of the biome reconstruction method applied to the late Pliocene and Quaternary pollen records from Lake El'gygytgyn. All terrestrial pollen taxa identified in the spectra from Lake El'gygytgyn were assigned to major vegetation types (biomes), which today occur near the lake and in the broader region of eastern and northern Asia and, thus, could be potentially present in this region during the past. When applied to the pollen spectra from the middle Pleistocene to present, the method suggests (1) a predominance of tundra during the Holocene, (2) a short interval during the marine isotope stage (MIS) 5.5 interglacial distinguished by cold deciduous forest, and (3) long phases of taiga dominance during MIS 31 and, particularly, MIS 11.3. These two latter interglacials seem to be some of the longest and warmest intervals in the study region within the past million years. During the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene interval (i.e., similar to 3.562-2.200 Ma), there is good correspondence between the millennial-scale vegetation changes documented in the Lake El'gygytgyn record and the alternation of cold and warm marine isotope stages, which reflect changes in the global ice volume and sea level. The biome reconstruction demonstrates changes in the regional vegetation from generally warmer/wetter environments of the earlier (i. e., Pliocene) interval towards colder/drier environments of the Pleistocene. The reconstruction indicates that the taxon-rich cool mixed and cool conifer forest biomes are mostly characteristic of the time prior to MIS G16, whereas the tundra biome becomes a prominent feature starting from MIS G6. These results consistently indicate that the study region supported significant tree populations during most of the interval prior to similar to 2.730 Ma. The cold-and drought-tolerant steppe biome first appears in the reconstruction similar to 3.298 Ma during the tundra-dominated MIS M2, whereas the tundra biome initially occurs between similar to 3.379 and similar to 3.378 Ma within MIS MG4. Prior to similar to 2.800 Ma, several other cold stages during this generally warm Pliocene interval were characterized by the tundra biome. | ['anderson', 'andreev', 'brigham', 'grette', 'haltia', 'leipe', 'lozhkin', 'melles', 'nowaczyk', 'tarasov', 'wennrich'] | ","['anderson', 'andreev', 'brigham', 'grette', 'haltia', 'leipe', 'lozhkin', 'melles', 'nowaczyk', 'tarasov', 'wennrich']",3

249,"The pollen complex from postglacial sediments of the Laptev Sea as a bioindicator | The first results of comparison of palynological analysis (pollen of terrestrial plants), SEM analysis of pollen morphology, and radiocarbon age dating (AMS14C) of sediments of the eastern shelf of the Laptev Sea show that the diverse taxonomic composition of pollen spectra provides an integrated idea of the vegetation and climate of the region over 11.2 calendar kiloyears. It is found that phases of the tree and shrub vegetation development (maxima of pollen of Betula sect. Nanae and Pinus s/g Haploxylon) correspond to the warm epochs in the Holocene. It is obvious that birch phytocoenoses first settled in the southern tundra subzone with increasing temperature, and then coniferous communities of forest tundra. An occurrence of pollen of shrubby birches (Nanae) suggests compliance of permafrost landscapes with cold climate conditions, i.e., with an annual average temperature of -2A degrees C and amount of precipitation of less than 500 mm. Owing to a progressive increase in summer temperatures, dwarf cedar and pine communities advanced toward the seashore. The SEM analysis results show that a significant proportion of regional coniferous pollen belongs to representatives of Pinus pumila (Pall.) and P. sylvestris L. In addition, the SEM study of the exine of Pinus sylvestris L. and P. pumila (Pall.) Regel pollen grains confirmed polymorphism in coniferous pollen. According to the inverse relationship between climate and vegetation, frequent climate fluctuations that are typical of progressive and differential postglacial transgression were revealed. An increase in arboreal pollen transfer onto the shelf later than 9.1 cal. ka coincides with the time of forest boundary migration to the north due to the warming of the Earth's climate. At that time, the tundra vegetation was replaced by forest-tundra vegetation, the maximum stage of sea transgression began, and there appeared a trend of increasing temperature and moisture. | ['naidina'] | ",['naidina'],3
250,"Pollen-derived paleovegetation reconstruction and long-term carbon accumulation at a fen site in the attawapiskat river watershed, Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada | The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) constitute a globally significant carbon pool; the paleoecological record provides an opportunity to investigate long-term drivers of change in carbon accumulation and related changes in vegetation. We present a Holocene record from the Victor Fen site (VM-3-3) in Ontario's HBL to reconstruct vegetation history, quantify rates of carbon accumulation, and determine the role of paleoclimatic drivers. Pollen analysis indicates initiation of peat accumulation over a mineral substrate, accompanied by relatively rapid rates of carbon accumulation, following emergence from the Tyrrell Sea ~6900 yrs BP. The earliest vegetation assemblage consisted of a tidal marsh, quickly succeeding to a Typha marsh, then a poor fen dominated by Sphagnum and Cyperaceae by 6400 yrs BP. Rapid rates of isostatic uplift at the time likely contributed to these changes. Once established, this fen community persisted without major vegetation change until the most recent century, when the abundance of shrub and Cyperaceae pollen increased, suggesting increasingly minerotrophic conditions. Average rate of long-term carbon accumulation (LORCA) for the whole record (mean = 22.8 g C m-2 yr-1) is similar to other northern peatlands, and higher than the Holocene average for an adjacent bog. Increased precipitation after ~2400 yrs BP may have contributed to the higher LORCA reconstructed for the late Holocene, but the increased precipitation did not coincide with any apparent changes in vegetation as inferred from pollen assemblages. | ['bunbury', 'finkelstein', 'oreilly'] | ","['bunbury', 'finkelstein', 'oreilly']",0
251,"A 6500-year pollen record from the Polistovo-Lovatskaya Mire System (northwest European Russia). Vegetation dynamics and signs of human impact | New pollen and plant macrofossil evidence from the Polistovo-Lovatskaya Mire System is presented. The results show that local vegetation of the mire system was affected by various factors such as climate, hydrogeology and autochthonous processes in the peat bog. An important palaeoecological event took place around 6500 cal BP and led to a dramatic increase of paludification processes and lateral expansion of the mire. Forests of spruce and broad-leaved species in various combinations represented primary vegetation of uplands; they began to degrade around 1500 years ago and disappeared in historical times (400-500 cal BP). First signs of arable farming in the area occurred around 4200 cal BP, regular and mild human pressure established about 1000 years cal BP, and a significant impact at the regional level became evident around 400 years ago. | ['nosova', 'severova', 'volkova'] | ","['nosova', 'severova', 'volkova']",4
252,"Past Pollen Production Reconstructed from Needle Production in Pinus sylvestris at the Northern Timberline: a Tool for Evaluating Palaeoclimate Reconstructions | Annual needle production (PROD) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and pine pollen accumulation rates (PAR) are compared along a 5-site transect from the Arctic Circle to the northern timberline. PROD is calculated using the Needle Trace Method (NTM). PAR is monitored by two series of pollen traps, located in the centres of mires and within forests, respectively. There is a strong year-to-year agreement in PAR and PROD between the sites for the common 19-year period for which both proxies are available. Mean July temperature of the previous year (TJUL-1) correlates statistically significantly with PROD at all five sites and with PAR in the four northernmost sites. There is also a significant relationship between TJUN-1 and PROD at all sites, and T-JUN and PAR at the two northernmost sites. PROD and PAR correlate most strongly in the three near tree line sites, where PROD explains up to 51% of the variation in PAR. On the basis of the calibration between PROD, PAR and TJUL-1, PROD and TJUL-1 are used to reconstruct past PAR. That such a reconstruction is realistic is supported by its agreement with the pollen record for 1982-2000 and with records of male flowering for the period 1956-1973. The use of PROD in reconstructing past PAR can help in interpreting the fossil pollen signal in terms of climate rather than vegetation change and in evaluating the high-resolution dating of peat profiles and calculations of the rate of peat accumulation. | ['aalto', 'hick', 'jalkanen', 'salminen'] | ","['aalto', 'hick', 'jalkanen', 'salminen']",1

254,"Postglacial record of diatom assemblage changes related to climate in an alpine lake in the northern Rocky Mountains, Canada | We relate changes in diatom assemblages to Holocene climate since ca. 10 300 cal. years BP at a small (4 ha), alkaline, alpine tundra lake in the Rocky Mountains of northeast British Columbia. A complex of small benthic Fragilaria-type taxa generally dominated the fossil diatom communities reflecting shallow, alkaline, and likely low light conditions resulting from minerogenic turbidity or extensive ice cover throughout the Holocene. Shifts in diatom assemblages occurred with changes in local vegetation, inferred from pollen and stomate records, and shifts in charcoal-inferred fire frequency (e.g., lowering of tree line and reduced fire frequency (approx. 7500 cal. years BP) and establishment of modern alpine tundra (approx. 3500 cal. years BP). Importantly, striking changes in diatom communities (e.g., during the mid-Holocene (approx. 5500 to approx. 3500 cal. years BP) and Medieval Warm Period (approx. AD 800 to approx. AD 1250)) occurred without evidence of vegetation shifts. During these times, diverse periphytic diatoms dominated suggesting improved benthic habitat availability with longer growing seasons and probably reduced alkalinity and turbidity with warmer- and wetter-than-present climates. Diatom analysis from this alpine lake provides a sensitive record of climate-related limnological responses, but also refines our previous understanding of Holocene climate changes in the northern Rocky Mountains inferred from terrestrial-based paleoecological records. | ['karst', 'riddoch', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'youngblut'] | ","['karst', 'riddoch', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'youngblut']",4
255,"Postglacial Reconstruction of Fire History Using Sedimentary Charcoal and Pollen From a Small Lake in Southwest Yukon Territory, Canada | Previous research suggests climate warming during the current century is likely to lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfire. Recent wildfire seasons in northern Canada generally support these studies, with some of the worst fire seasons on record occurring during the past decade. While we can readily track the spatial and temporal distribution of these events during recent decades using satellite-derived data, these records of past fire activity are relatively short. Proxy records of past fire activity are needed to fully understand how fire regimes may be shifting in response to changing climatic conditions. A high-resolution fire record for the full Holocene was developed using a 539.5-cm sediment core collected from a small lake in southwest Yukon Territory, Canada. Macroscopic charcoal was counted throughout the core at contiguous 0.5-cm intervals. The core was also analyzed for loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility. Fossil pollen preserved in the lake sediment was analyzed to determine vegetation change throughout the Holocene. Macroscopic charcoal analysis indicates an active fire history throughout the record, with 91 fires recorded during the Holocene. Results suggest the fire regime in this region responds to both top-down (climate) and bottom-up (vegetation) factors. Fire return intervals changed in response to shifts in precipitation and temperature as well as the expansion of lodgepole pine into the region. The shifts in precipitation and temperature were attributed to the oscillation of the Aleutian Low pressure system and fluctuations in climate associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. | ['pisaric', 'prince', 'turner'] | ","['pisaric', 'prince', 'turner']",3
256,"Postglacial trends in palynological richness in the northern Fennoscandian tree-line area and their ecological interpretation | The northern Fennoscandian tree-line area consists of fairly distinct vegetation zones. The pollen stratigraphies of two boreal sites and two tundra sites were studied and the palynological data analysed numerically. The main aim was to measure palynological richness, using rarefaction analysis, and to assess its value in reflecting patterns of past floristic richness. Rates of palynological change were measured using both chord distance and Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity coefficient. The results show low palynological richness during the Younger Dryas. The values increase rapidly at the transition to the Holocene. During the Holocene the values are in reversed order in relation to present vegetation density, the tundra sires having the highest palynological richness. This suggests that differences in the size of the pollen catchment may have an important role in palynological richness estimates and that no straight comparisons of palynological richness should be made between sites from different vegetation zones. Most pronounced changes in palynological richness take place in the Lake Rautuselka core, where high Pinus pollen influx is correlated with low palynological richness. At the boreal sites, high rates of change are associated with higher palynological richness whereas no similar relationship is observed at the tundra sites. | ['seppa'] | ",['seppa'],0
257,"A probabilistic approach to the use of pollen indicators for plant attributes and biomes: An application to European vegetation at 0 and 6 ka | Aim: This paper presents a probabilistic method for the characterization of pollen taxa using attributes, and for the reconstitution of past biomes. The probabilities are calculated on the basis of European floristic and pollen databases sufficiently large and exhaustive to provide robust estimates. Location: The analysis is based on data from approximately 1000 sites throughout Europe. Method: We use all the pollen data from the European Pollen Database (EPD), which contains about 50 000 pollen assemblages distributed across Europe and covering the period from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present. Using existing floras, each pollen taxon has been characterized by allocating one or more modes of several attributes, chosen according to the biogeography and phenology of the taxon. With this information, conditional probabilities are defined, representing the chance of a given attribute mode occurring in a given pollen spectrum, when the taxa assemblage is known. The concept of co-occurrence is used to provide a greater amount of information to compensate for difficulties in the identification of pollen grains, allowing a better interpretation when there is little diversity in the pollen assemblage. Results: The method has been validated using a dataset of modern samples against existing methods of biome classification and remote sensing data. An application is proposed in which the new method is used to produce biomes for pollen data 6000 years ago. This confirms previous results showing an extension of the deciduous forest to the north, east and south, explained by milder winters in western and northern Europe, and cooler and wetter climate in the Mediterranean region. Conclusion: The results show the new method to be efficient, reliable and flexible and to be an improvement over the previous method of biomization. They will be used to test simulations of earth system models running on periods with climate significantly different from the present day, enabling a robust test of the validity of applying these models to the future. | ['brewer', 'cheddadi', 'davis', 'gachet', 'gritti', 'guiot'] | ","['brewer', 'cheddadi', 'davis', 'gachet', 'gritti', 'guiot']",1
258,"Arctic Holocene proxy climate database - new approaches to assessing geochronological accuracy and encoding climate variables | We present a systematic compilation of previously published Holocene proxy climate records from the Arctic. We identified 170 sites from north of 58 degrees N latitude where proxy time series extend back at least to 6 cal ka (all ages in this article are in calendar years before present - BP), are resolved at submillennial scale (at least one value every 400 +/- 200 years) and have age models constrained by at least one age every 3000 years. In addition to conventional meta-data for each proxy record (location, proxy type, reference), we include two novel parameters that add functionality to the database. First, ""climate interpretation"" is a series of fields that logically describe the specific climate variable(s) represented by the proxy record. It encodes the proxy-climate relation reported by authors of the original studies into a structured format to facilitate comparison with climate model outputs. Second, ""geochronology accuracy score"" (chron score) is a numerical rating that reflects the overall accuracy of C-14-based age models from lake and marine sediments. Chron scores were calculated using the original author-reported C-14 ages, which are included in this database. The database contains 320 records (some sites include multiple records) from six regions covering the circumpolar Arctic: Fennoscandia is the most densely sampled region (31% of the records), whereas only five records from the Russian Arctic met the criteria for inclusion. The database contains proxy records from lake sediment (60 %), marine sediment (32 %), glacier ice (5 %), and other sources. Most (61 %) reflect temperature (mainly summer warmth) and are primarily based on pollen, chironomid, or diatom assemblages. Many (15 %) reflect some aspect of hydroclimate as inferred from changes in stable isotopes, pollen and diatom assemblages, humification index in peat, and changes in equilibrium-line altitude of glaciers. This comprehensive database can be used in future studies to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of Arctic Holocene climate changes and their causes.

259,"The use of quantitative models to assess long-term climate-vegetation dynamics - a case study from the northern Scandinavian Mountains | Quantitative vegetation models combined with fossil pollen records have large potentials for assessing long-term vegetation dynamics. In this study, vegetation cover as a function of July temperatures was modelled for the Dividalen valley area situated in the northern Scandinavian Mountains. Site-specific pollen deposition values of the two dominating tree species pine and birch were simulated and compared with empirical fossil pollen values. The applied vegetation model could not explain the forest dynamics prior to 7400 cal. BP, although after this date, the forest seemed to have received a modern structure, and summer temperatures could potentially explain the long-term variations in forest cover. The most extensive forest cover occurred c. 7400-3800 cal. BP, corresponding to July temperatures of 0.5-1 degrees C above the present. The approach proved sensitive to both site location and data quality. Careful site-selection is of importance for the application, and pollen accumulation rates are to be preferred as pollen percentage values proved problematic. | ['jensen', 'karlsen', 'sjogren'] | ","['jensen', 'karlsen', 'sjogren']",1
260,"Quaternary Landforms and Basin Morphology Control the Natural Eutrophy of Boreal Lakes and Their Sensitivity to Anthropogenic Forcing | Both natural and anthropogenic changes in boreal lakes have been studied utilizing paleolimnological methods, but the spatial variation in the natural conditions of lakes and its connection to geological factors has drawn less attention. Our aims were to examine the spatial distribution of naturally eutrophic lakes on the previously glaciated terrain of central-eastern Finland and the relationship between pre-human disturbance water quality and geological factors related to the basins and their catchments. Furthermore, we studied the pre- to post-human disturbance changes in the diatom assemblages and water quality of 48 lakes (51 sampling sites) across the pre-disturbance phosphorus gradient by using the top-bottom sampling approach and multivariate statistics. According to our results, naturally eutrophic boreal lakes are more common than previously thought, occurring on fine-grained and organic Quaternary landforms, including fine-grained till. Our study emphasizes the importance of the previously overlooked matter of till grain-size variation as a driver behind the spatial variation in the natural trophic states of boreal lakes. The location of a lake in the hydrologic landscape and basin morphology appear to be important factors as well. Shallow, naturally eutrophic lakes with short water residence times and high catchment area to lake area and volume ratios have been particularly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Our results indicate that cultural eutrophication is not the only water protection challenge for the relatively remote and dilute boreal lakes, but salinization and alkalinization are also serious threats that should be taken into account. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the notable variation in the natural conditions of boreal lakes in addition to mitigating the effects of anthropogenic forcing, such as nutrient loading, catchment erosion, salt pollution, and climate change, in order to achieve efficient water protection. | ['kauppila', 'tammelin'] | ","['kauppila', 'tammelin']",4
261,"The Raised Bogs of Southeastern Labrador Canada Classification Distribution Vegetation and Recent Dynamics | (1) The mires of Labrador form is distinct geographical zonation; concentric raised bogs occur at low altitudes along the southern coast, excentric and plateau bogs extend inland to slightly greater altitudes and higher latitudes, and patterned fens occupy most of the interior north to the tundra. (2) The zone boundaries parallel contours and climatic isopleths, and the zonation is explained in terms of the effects of moisture surplus, soligenous water flow and physiolography on mire development. (3) The raised bogs are similar to oceanic mires, with an extensive ground cover of Cladonia spp., absence of trees on the mire expanse, and pronounced surface patterns of broad peat hummocks and open-water pools. Three floristic noda are recognized in the phytosociological table: Cladonia stellaris-C. rangiferina-Kalmia angustifolia nodum on raised hummocks and Sphagnum rubellum-Scirpus cespitosus and Sphagnum lindbergii-Scirpus cespitosus noda in hollows. (4) As a result of the extensive cover of lichens the hummock vegetation readily burns during lightning fires, which are prevalent on the uplands. Examination of a chronosequence of stands burned in 1898, 1931, 1959 and 1975 documents the rapid resprouting of most vascular species and a gradual succession of Cladonia spp. and bryophytes. (5) The recent history of the hummock vegetation involves the alteration of Clondonia stellaris and Sphagnum fuscum, as documented by the presence of recurrence surfaces in short cores, peat monoliths, and long cores. Local factors, including fire and the lowering of the water table through pool drainage, are frequently responsible for changes in the ground cover and the degree of peat humification, and they may confound the stratigraphic interpretation of climatic change. | ['foster', 'glaser'] | ","['foster', 'glaser']",0
262,"Holocene rapid climate changes and ice-rafting debris events reflected in high-resolution European charcoal records | In contrast to marked climate change across glacial-interglacial cycles, the Holocene epoch represents a relatively warm, stable interval. However, on finer temporal scales, it too has experienced both gradual and rapid changes in climate. In the North Atlantic region, many rapid climate changes (RCCs) coincide with ice-rafted debris (IRD) or Bond events, which are associated with cooling and suggested to occur with periodicities of 1370 +/- 500 years. Given that climate is a dominant control of fire activity, regulating both vegetation productivity and fuel moisture, this study investigated the linkage between Holocene fire, IRD episodes and associated RCCs in seven high-resolution charcoal records distributed across Europe. Results show low-frequency fire periodicities of 500-600 years, 900-1400 and 2400 years that occurred simultaneously across northern and mid-latitude Europe, suggesting that regional fire disturbance responded to large-scale climate drivers. The 900-1400 year periodicity is most common among sites and of similar frequency to IRD episodes, potentially reflecting a connection between mechanisms regulating IRD flux in the North Atlantic and wildfire activity in Europe. Although the data indicate some spatial variability in fire induced by local drivers (such as vegetation and human impact) during RCC events associated with IRD peaks, broad-scale patterns are discernible. Specifically, Northern Europe burned more during the 10.2, 9.4, 8.2, 5.9 and 4.2 kiloannum before present (ka) RCC events when climate was drier, and less during the 2.9 and 1.4 ka events when climate was moister. In contrast, in mid-latitude Europe, a higher incidence of fire is documented at 8.2 and 1.4 ka when climate was drier and a lower incidence of fire is associated with moister conditions at 10.2, 9.4 and 2.9 ka. Spatial heterogeneity is evident in mid-latitude Europe during the 5.9, 4.2 and 0.4 ka events. These spatially explicit sub-continental scale differences in fire activity may be related to differences in moisture availability resulting from shifts in associated atmospheric circulation patterns.

263,"Rapid Environmental Change over the Past Decade Revealed by Isotopic Analysis of the California Mussel in the Northeast Pacific | The anthropogenic input of fossil fuel carbon into the atmosphere results in increased carbon dioxide (CO2) into the oceans, a process that lowers seawater pH, decreases alkalinity and can inhibit the production of shell material. Corrosive water has recently been documented in the northeast Pacific, along with a rapid decline in seawater pH over the past decade. A lack of instrumentation prior to the 1990s means that we have no indication whether these carbon cycle changes have precedence or are a response to recent anthropogenic CO2 inputs. We analyzed stable carbon and oxygen isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18) of decade-old California mussel shells (Mytilus californianus) in the context of an instrumental seawater record of the same length. We further compared modern shells to shells from 1000 to 1340 years BP and from the 1960s to the present and show declines in the delta C-13 of modern shells that have no historical precedent. Our finding of decline in another shelled mollusk (limpet) and our extensive environmental data show that these delta C-13 declines are unexplained by changes to the coastal food web, upwelling regime, or local circulation. Our observed decline in shell delta C-13 parallels other signs of rapid changes to the nearshore carbon cycle in the Pacific, including a decline in pH that is an order of magnitude greater than predicted by an equilibrium response to rising atmospheric CO2, the presence of low pH water throughout the region, and a record of a similarly steep decline in delta C-13 in algae in the Gulf of Alaska. These unprecedented changes and the lack of a clear causal variable underscores the need for better quantifying carbon dynamics in nearshore environments. | ['archer', 'colman', 'martin', 'mccoy', 'pfister', 'wootton'] | ","['archer', 'colman', 'martin', 'mccoy', 'pfister', 'wootton']",0
264,"Rapid, time-transgressive, and variable responses to early Holocene midcontinental drying in North America | The end Pleistocene to early Holocene drying of the North American midcontinent is an important case study for understanding regional drought, its drivers, and its impacts. This paper synthesizes pollen, Œ¥13C, eolian, and paleohydrological proxies to document the spatial and temporal patterns in the onset and rate of drying. The timing of onset ranged from 14 to 6 ka with most sites drying between 10 and 8 ka (calendar years ago). The dominant spatial pattern is time transgressive, with interior Great Plains sites beginning to dry before peripheral sites. This time-transgressive trend can be explained as a region-wide drying that caused ecotones to shift eastward, or could indicate a progressive shift in atmospheric drying from west to east. One-third of sites responded rapidly to drying; a cluster of rapid responses occurred ca. 8 ka. The combination of onsets between 14 and 6 ka and rapid responses at 8 ka strongly suggests that (1) the combination of high summer insolation, Laurentide Ice Sheet retreat, and Lake Agassiz drainage drove midcontinental drying, and (2) drying accelerated with Laurentide Ice Sheet collapse at 8.4 ka. Local factors strongly mediate the timing and rate of site responses to regional drying. Local responses to future drying in the Great Plains also should be highly variable, which challenges impact assessments of future climate changes.¬© 2010 Geological Society of America. | ['bartlein', 'diffenbaugh', 'shuman', 'webb', 'iii', 'williams'] | ","['bartlein', 'diffenbaugh', 'shuman', 'webb', 'iii', 'williams']",3
265,"Can rapidly accumulating Holocene peat profiles provide sub-decadal resolution proxy climate data? | To test the potential for developing sub-decadal resolution records of ombrotrophic bog surface wetness (BSW), selected abrupt climate events were identified in cores from four sites in north-west Europe and time-slices over each event were investigated at 25-mm resolution using peat humification, testate amoeba and plant macrofossil analyses. Agedepth models based on radiocarbon, spheroidal carbonaceous particle and tephra dates were applied and the error in these models was used to determine the effective temporal sampling resolution, which in most cases was sub-decadal. Fine-resolution results revealed some inconsistencies in the co-variability of individual proxies and there was a lack of correspondence between some results from adjacent cores. However, we found evidence of abrupt shifts in BSW occurring over ca. 520 years, indicating a more rapid proxy response than identified in previous research. To maximize potential temporal resolution and produce reliable sub-decadal BSW data in future research, we recommended that peat-based studies should obtain the best possible chronological control, focus on sites with high species diversity and rapid accumulation rates and perform replicate coring, or use open peat sections where the stratigraphy can be clearly seen, to assess intra-site differences in microtopography. Site-specific factors should be a primary consideration in the selection of sites for future fine-resolution research.

266,"Recent acceleration of carbon accumulation in a boreal peatland, south central Alaska | The ongoing warming in high-latitude regions may be causing rapid changes in the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Of particular concern is the fate of belowground soil organic carbon stored in peat-accumulating wetlands, as these large carbon pools are sensitive to temperature and moisture conditions. Despite their important role in the global carbon cycle, considerable uncertainty remains over the carbon balance of northern peatlands in a changing climate. Here we examine the response of vegetation and carbon dynamics in a wet boreal peatland to recent climate warming using empirical peat core data and a new modeling approach. We observed a widespread shift from herbaceous Carex fen peat to Sphagnum moss peat around 100 years ago that was accompanied by a sharp increase in carbon accumulation rate. The observed apparent carbon accumulation rates over the past 100 years (96.8 g C m-2 yr-1) were almost 10 times greater than those over the past 4000 years (11.5 g C m-2 yr-1). Once differential decomposition history was considered using three modeling approaches, the expected long-term accumulation rate of recent peat was still 2-6 times greater than that of the past 4000 years. We propose that recent warming has led to Sphagnum establishment, which rapidly altered the peatland surface chemistry and hydrology, further promoting Sphagnum growth and enhancing the carbon sink capacity of this peatland. Longer and warmer growing seasons could also have stimulated plant growth. Our results imply that accelerated carbon accumulation under global warming in some wet peatlands might offset some of the carbon losses experienced from other peatland types. ¬© 2012.

267,"Recent climate warming favours more specialized cladoceran taxa in western Canadian Arctic lakes | AimShifts in the distribution of freshwater algal communities as a result of climate-related limnological changes are well documented; however, impacts on higher trophic levels have received less attention. For example, little is known about how Cladocera (Crustacea, Branchiopoda), often dominant invertebrates and key ecological indicators, have responded to recent warming on broad spatial and temporal scales. Here, we use lake sediment records to test the hypothesis that recent, intensive warming in the western Canadian Arctic has resulted in consistent shifts in the composition of cladoceran assemblages.LocationSmall, first-order lakes in the Mackenzie Delta region of the western Canadian Arctic.MethodsSediment cores representing the recent past (approximately 150-200years) were obtained from five lakes spanning a strong climatic gradient. Subfossil remains of Cladocera were identified and enumerated and overall primary production was inferred using spectroscopic techniques. The habitat preferences and feeding strategy of each taxon were compared. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis was used to estimate compositional turnover since 1850, and compared with that of three cladoceran assemblages from Nova Scotia, to place high-latitude changes in context.ResultsCladoceran assemblage changes occurred coincident with the timing of known regional warming and were strongly linked to estimated changes in primary production. In the northern and deepest lakes, an increase in the planktonic, filter-feeding taxon Bosmina spp. coincided with a decrease in the generalist littoral taxa Chydorus cf. brevilabris and Alona circumfimbriata. In the more southern lakes, an increase in macrophyte-associated scrapers Acroperus harpae and Eurycercus spp. occurred concurrently with decreases in generalist taxa. In one lake, an increase in another specialist, an obligate mud-dwelling taxon, was observed.Main conclusionsIn the western Canadian Arctic, warming has resulted in an increase in cladoceran taxa occupying more specialized feeding and habitat niches. Generalist taxa capable of occupying multiple habitats and employing diverse feeding strategies have been systematically replaced by more specialist species. This response is analogous to what has been inferred for algal communities across the Northern Hemisphere, and represents the first evidence of consistent cladoceran changes to recent climate warming in high-latitude regions. | ['cheng', 'deasley', 'korosi', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'thienpont'] | ","['cheng', 'deasley', 'korosi', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'thienpont']",3

269,"Recent history of trends in vegetation greenness and large-scale ecosystem disturbances in Eurasia | Recent patterns of land cover and vegetation dynamics on the Euasian continent have been linked to changes in the global carbon cycle. Our study was conducted to evaluate patterns in a 19-yr record of global satellite observations of terrestrial vegetation from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) as a means to characterize major trends in both vegetation 'greenness' and ecosystem disturbance. The fraction absorbed of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) by vegetation canopies worldwide has been computed from the AVHRR at a monthly time interval from 1982 to 2000 and gridded at a spatial resolution of 8 km globally. Unlike previous studies of the AVHRR multiyear time-series of vegetation dynamics, the 8-km spatial resolution makes it possible to compare disturbance events and greenness trends at the same level of spatial detail. Positive trends in FPAR were detected throughout a major greenbelt of central-eastern Europe starting in the mid-1980s. This Eurasian greenbelt extended in a wide swath over the Urals, into the vicinity of Lake Baykal south of the central Siberian plateau, mainly along a latitude belt from 55 degrees N to 65 degrees N. There was also significantly positive greening in relatively large areas of Great Britain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, the Caucasus and southern India. Nonetheless, a strong downward trend in the FPAR time-series over most of Eurasia was observed by the end of the 1990s. Throughout the 19-yr time period, Eurasia was also impacted by many notable droughts and other disturbance events that could have substantially offset decadal carbon gains attributed to satellite-observed greening. Large-scale ecosystems disturbance events were identified in the FPAR time-series by locating anomalously low values (FPAR-LO) that lasted longer than 12 consecutive months at any 8-km pixel. We find verifiable evidence of numerous disturbance types across Eurasia, including regional patterns of severe droughts, forest fires and insect outbreaks. | ['klooster', 'kumar', 'nemani', 'potter'] | ","['klooster', 'kumar', 'nemani', 'potter']",4
270,"Recent Warming Fuels Increased Organic Carbon Export From Arctic Permafrost | Climate-driven thawing of Arctic permafrost renders its vast carbon reserves susceptible to microbial degradation, serving as a potentially potent positive feedback hidden within the climate system. While seemingly intuitive, the relationship between thermally driven permafrost losses and organic carbon (OC) export remains largely unexplored in natural settings. Filling this knowledge gap, we present down-core bulk and compound-specific radiocarbon records of permafrost change from a sediment core taken within the Alaskan Colville River delta spanning the last c. 2,700 years. Fingerprinted by significantly older radiocarbon ages of bulk OC and long-chain fatty acids, these data expose a thermally driven increase in permafrost OC export and/or deepening of mobilizable permafrost layers over the last c. 160 years after the Little Ice Age. Comparison of OC content and radiocarbon data between recent and Roman warming episodes likely implies that the rate of warming, alongside the prevailing boundary conditions, may dictate the ultimate fate of the Arctic's permafrost inventory.

272,"Reconstruction of holocene changes in alpine vegetation and climate, Susie Lake, British Columbia, Canada | A ca. 9000-yr pollen, macrofossil, and sedimentological record from a laminated sediment core obtained from Susie Lake, British Columbia, reveals changes in vegetation and inferred climate during the Holocene. The pollen record indicates that a shrub and herb assemblage (ca. 9000-7800 yr BP) was rapidly replaced by a spruce (Picea) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest (ca. 7800-4000 yr BP) under the influence of warmer-than-present climate conditions. The macrofossil record indicates that an elevated treeline persisted from ca. 5200-2000 yr BP Pine pollen percentages increase significantly from ca. 5000-4000 yr BP and likely reflect the migration of P. contorta into the area. The disappearance of spruce (ca. 4000 yr BP) and fir (ca. 2000 yr BP) needles from the record indicates a gradual lowering of treeline below the elevation of Susie Lake and the establishment of the modem cold and moist climate. A pronounced increase in extralocal western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) pollen occurs at ca. 2000 yr BP and is coincidental with an increase in the number of debris flow-derived, fining-upward graded beds in the core. These are probably a consequence of landscape destabilization associated with treeline depression and an increase in storm frequency. Increased storm frequency may be a 'consequence of inland penetration of the moist Pacific air mass and the displacement of the drier continental air mass. This study suggests that substantial variations in vegetation assemblages can result from past changes in regional circulation patterns. | ['hill', 'osborn', 'spooner'] | ","['hill', 'osborn', 'spooner']",3
273,"The Reconstruction of Boreal Forest-Fire History from Lake-Sediments - a Comparison of Charcoal, Pollen, Sedimentological, and Geochemical Indexes | Fossil charcoal, fossil pollen, sedimentological and geochemical analyses of lake sediments have been used previously to reconstruct a history of local fires and resulting vegetation change. The rationale behind these approaches is described and the usefulness of each technique for reconstructing fire history in the boreal forest is assessed empirically. Historical and dendrochronological records provide regional and local fire histories for a site in Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada. The local and regional history of fires is compared with the microscopic charcoal content, macroscopic charcoal content, elemental carbon content, fossil pollen content, sedimentology, and geochemistry of annually laminated sediments from a small lake. There is no significant correlation between the abundance of microscopic charcoal, macroscopic charcoal and total elemental carbon content of the sediments. Automated measures of microscopic charcoal abundance made with an image analysis system are correlated significantly with optical counts of microscopic charcoal. None of the charcoal measures provide unequivocal records of local fire activity and the abundance of microscopic charcoal appears to be influenced by variations in regional fire activity. However, the highest depositional rate of macrofossil charcoal occurred during the time of a fire that burned within the drainage basin. Variations in sedimentological measures and geochemistry do not correlate with local fire activity. Fossil pollen percentages and accumulation rates display a pattern of variation that is consistent with observed vegetation responses to fire in the boreal forest. What is likely apparent in the pollen record are the results of a series of burns of sufficient extent and intensity to kill most of the above-ground biomass of the vegetation in an area at least as great as the drainage basin. The inability of evidence from lake sediments to provide detailed histories of past fire activity is not surprising given the wide range of variation in the spatial extent, proximity, intensity and impact of individual fires. | ['larsen', 'macdonald', 'moser', 'szeicz'] | ","['larsen', 'macdonald', 'moser', 'szeicz']",1
274,"The reconstruction of burned area and fire severity using charcoal from boreal lake sediments | Although lacustrine sedimentary charcoal has long been used to infer paleofires, their quantitative reconstructions require improvements of the calibration of their links with fire regimes (i.e. occurrence, area, and severity) and the taphonomic processes that affect charcoal particles between the production and the deposition in lake sediments. Charcoal particles >150 mu m were monitored yearly from 2011 to 2016 using traps submerged in seven head lakes situated in flat-to-rolling boreal forest landscapes in eastern Canada. The burned area was measured, and the above-ground fire severity was assessed using the differentiated normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index, derived from LANDSAT images, and measurements taken within zones radiating 3, 15, and 30 km from the lakes. In order to evaluate potential lag effects in the charcoal record, fire metrics were assessed for the year of recorded charcoal recording (lag 0) and up to 5 years before charcoal deposition (lag 5). A total of 92 variables were generated and sorted using a Random Forest-based methodology. The most explanatory variables for annual charcoal particle presence, expressed as the median surface area, were selected. Results show that, temporally, sedimentary charcoal accurately recorded fire events without a temporal lag; spatially, fires were recorded up to 30 km from the lakes. Selected variables highlighted the importance of burned area and fire severity in explaining lacustrine charcoal. The charcoal influx was thus driven by fire area and severity during the production process. The dispersion process of particles resulted mostly of wind transportation within the regional (<30 km) source area. Overall, charcoal median surface area represents a reliable proxy for reconstructing past burned areas and fire severities. | ['aleman', 'ali', 'bergeron', 'blarquez', 'carcaillet', 'grondin', 'hennebelle', 'landry'] | ","['aleman', 'ali', 'bergeron', 'blarquez', 'carcaillet', 'grondin', 'hennebelle', 'landry']",4
275,"Reconstruction of Past Climate Basing on the Isotopic Composition of Carbon from Fossil Remains | The areas of Northern Eurasia and the Far North regions with a sharply continental climate are of particular interest to paleoclimatologists. The nature of these areas preserves many features of the Late Glacial period. However, the reliability of the classical paleoclimatic methods in these areas is low. It is known that climate may affect the delta13C value of plants, causing isotopic variations of up to 3. The authors propose to use the carbon isotope compositions of bone carbonate of herbivorous animals as a paleoclimatic indicator for the Polar Regions.To test the potential of the proposed paleoclimatic indicator, the authors studied the carbon isotopic composition of carbonate of bone (reliably dated by the radiocarbon method) of Late Pleistocene mammals (mammoth mostly) from the area of the Lena River delta - the New Siberian Islands - Oyagossky Yar (the total of 43 samples). These data suggest that the Late Pleistocene climate in North Yakutia was not stable. Instability was expressed in the sharp, short-term (500-2000 years), occasional episodes of relatively warm climate that may be ranked as interstadials based on their intensity. | ['di', 'matteo', 'iacumin', 'kuznetsova', 'nikolaev'] | ","['di', 'matteo', 'iacumin', 'kuznetsova', 'nikolaev']",3
276,"Recovery from acidification in boreal lakes inferred from macroinvertebrates and subfossil chironomids | Acidification of waters and soils caused by emissions and the long-range transport of air pollutants has been a serious worldwide problem during the last decades. The extent of the acidification problem in Finnish acid-sensitive forest lakes was examined in the Acidification Research Project (HAPRO) in the mid-1980s. The recent decline in the emissions of air pollutants has resulted in the chemical recovery of watersheds in many regions, and the present work on the recovery processes in acidified Finnish headwater lakes (REPRO) was launched to examine whether the chemical recovery has already been accompanied by biological recovery. The patterns of recovery were studied by re-sampling littoral macrozoobenthos in a subset of the previously sampled HAPRO lakes. Paleolimnological samples were taken in order to assess the possible dependence of lacustrine chironomid communities on the changing degree of acidification. Acid sensitive and moderately acid sensitive benthic species revealed slight recovery in the formerly most acidic (pH <= 5.5) but recently recovered lakes. The most significant factors affecting the response of benthic communities were increased mean lake pH and decreased labile aluminium concentration. Paleolimnological chironomid analysis revealed a slight response along the pH gradient, but also significant structural similarity between the present and pristine chironomid assemblages. This implies that no major changes in chironomid communities of these acidic lakes have occurred during the past centuries. The alternative future trends and threats to biological recovery in small headwater lakes are discussed. | ['hynynen', 'merilainen'] | ","['hynynen', 'merilainen']",0
277,"Regional Holocene climate and landscape changes recorded in the large subarctic lake Tornetrask, N Fennoscandia | Understanding the response of sensitive Arctic and subarctic landscapes to climate change is essential to determine the risks of ongoing and projected climate warming. However, these responses will not be uniform in terms of timing and magnitude across the landscape because of site-specific differences in ecosystem susceptibility to climate forcing. Here we present a multi-proxy analysis of a sediment record from the 330-km(2) lake Tornetrask to assess the sensitivity of the Fennoscandian subarctic landscape to climate change over the past similar to 9500 years. By comparing responses of this large-lake system to past climatic and environmental changes with those in small lakes in its catchment, we assessed when the magnitude of change was sufficient to affect an entire region rather than only specific sub-catchments that may be more sensitive to localized environmental changes such as, e.g., tree-line dynamics. Our results show three periods of regional landscape alteration with distinct change in sediment composition: i) landscape development following deglaciation and through the Holocene Thermal Maximum, similar to 9500-3400 cal yr BP; ii) increased soil erosion during the Little Ice Age (LIA); and iii) rapid change during the past century coincident with ongoing climate change. The gradual landscape development led to successive changes in the lake sediment composition over several millennia, whereas climate cooling during the late Holocene caused a rather abrupt shift occurring within similar to 100 years. However, this shift at the onset of the LIA (similar to 750 cal yr BP) occurred >2000 years later than the first indications for climate cooling recorded in small lakes in the Tornetrask catchment, suggesting that a critical ecosystem threshold was not crossed until the LIA. In contrast, the ongoing response to recent climate change was immediate, emphasizing the unprecedented scale of ongoing climate changes in subarctic Fennoscandia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

278,"Regional signatures of changing landscape and climate of northern Central Siberia in the Holocene | On the basis of geochronological and palynological materials, 25 sections of Holocene deposits and soils of northern Central Siberia were studied by paleocarpological methods. Special attention was given to the reconstruction of the dynamics of speciation of forest cover in time and space. As a result, climatic and ecological settings have been dynamically portrayed for each kind of landscape, and quantitative parameters of paleoclimates have been calculated. The main peaks of climatic changes of the postglacial history have been detected in the ranges 8.5-8.0 ka (thermal maximum) and 2.5-2.0 ka (thermal minimum). Importantly, the thermal maximum is characterized by warming up by 3-9degreesC in winter and by 2-6degreesC in summer. The anomaly in moisture content was insignificant. In the Middle Holocene (6.5-5.0 ka), the positive temperature trend was kept, but it was accompanied by a nearly double increase in annual atmospheric wetting. During the Late Holocene cooling (2.5-2.0 ka), the negative temperature trend led to the degradation of forest vegetation which at that time remained only in the extreme south of the territory. | ['koshkarov', 'koshkarova'] | ","['koshkarov', 'koshkarova']",1
279,"Relationships between charcoal particles in air and sediments in west-central Siberia | Production and size of charred particles determine transport and deposition in lakes. Lack of such data is a principal obstacle to interpretation of past fire from charcoal profiles. Our two-part analysis includes a calibration study, to assess charred-particle production and transport during fire, and a study of charred particles in sediment. The calibration step establishes the magnitude and size distribution of particle accumulation from traps during a controlled burn of Pinus sylvestris forest in west-central Siberia. This high-intensity fire consumed 3.71 kg m(-2) of fuels and produced 0.0729 kg m(-2) of airborne particles. for an emission factor of 0.02 kg kg(-1). Particle flux to the ground was 1 to 3 mm(2)cm(-2) yr(-1) inside the burn; it declined sharply within 5 m of the burn edge, and it was variable but without trend to a distance of 60 m. Particle-size distributions were conservative, with a slope of -2 on plots of log frequency versus log diameter, and sediment data suggest this slope may steepen as sources become more remote and as large particles are progressively lost due to settling. Deposition from the plume is similar to accumulation rates in sediment, with apparent upward bias in sediments as expected from broad geographic patterns in charcoal distributions. During the mid-Holocene charred-particle accumulation in lake sediments (10(1) mm(2)cm(-2) yr(-1) was greater than observed in particle traps within the experimental burn. Particles were larger, suggesting nearby sources. Rates decreased by 3800 BP to values lower than average rates in particle traps, and samples were depleted in large particles. Low rates and infrequent large particles indicate sources were distant. Accumulation rates and particle sizes were again high from 3400 to 2800 and from 1400 to 700 BP. Close correspondence between the accumulation rates during the experimental burn and in sediments and particle evidence for source area, as well as their agreement with particle-trap data from the experimental burn, suggest that, in this region, fire may have been more frequent and closer in the mid-Holocene than today. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that changes in charred particle accumulation also reflect changes in supply of sediment to the core sire. | ['clark', 'goldammer', 'lynch', 'stock'] | ","['clark', 'goldammer', 'lynch', 'stock']",3
280,"Relative pollen productivity estimates and changes in Holocene vegetation cover in the deciduous forest of southeastern Quebec, Canada | The Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model was used to quantify Holocene changes in vegetation cover in the deciduous forest of southeastern Quebec, Canada. The Extended R-Value (ERV) model was used to obtain relative pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) for eight tree taxa and to determine the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) for lakes in this ecosystem. Modern vegetation was estimated using pollen data from 16 small (<0.5 km(2)) lakes and a species-level vegetation survey of southern Quebec. The RSAP was estimated to be within 1600 m of the lakes. Tsuga, Fagus, and Quercus were the most productive taxa, and Populus and Acer were the lowest. Reconstructed changes in absolute vegetation cover show a high abundance of Picea followed by Populus in the early Holocene. The reconstructed values for Populus suggest that it was widely distributed across the landscape. Abies and Acer were dominant on the landscape during the late to mid-Holocene, and an increase in Picea during the Neoglacial is more significant than in percentage diagrams. The REVEALS results provide estimates of land-cover change that are more realistic and informative than the use of pollen percentages alone. | ['chaput', 'gajewski'] | ","['chaput', 'gajewski']",0
281,"Reports for the large predator policy statement, grazing, biodiversity and carnivore management | The Norwegian cultural landscape - landscape and nature types formed as a result of agricultural activities and other human utilisation of natural resources through several thousand years - holds a unique biological diversity. Vegetation types as well as plant and animal species related to the cultural landscape are threatened by current changes in land use, primarily by overgrowth and forest colonisation of seminatural areas. Most of the traditional use of outfields has ceased due to changes in social and economic conditions, and today only grazing (mainly by sheep and domestic reindeer), some wood cutting and some summer farming remain. As the populations of carnivores were brought to an almost complete extinction towards the first half of the 20th century, the grazing regimes also changed and the shepherding ceased. Today, as large carnivore populations have begun to recover, levels of carnivore depredation on livestock have increased dramatically in some areas. In this report we try to elucidate the influence of carnivore management on biological diversity related to different grazing regimes. This is obtained by reviewing 1) the traditional use of outfields in Norway, and 2) how grazing by livestock and wild herbivores affects the biodiversity in boreal and alpine ecosystems. On this basis, we attempt to anticipate the ecological consequences of altered land use that may result from different carnivore management strategies. The resources of outfields and commons have been very important for Norwegian agriculture since the very beginning. The land area that can be used as arable land is limited but large outfield areas could be used for both grazing and hay making. In pre-industrial agriculture the infields depended on manure from livestock for food production. Most of the fodder was harvested in the outfields and large outfield areas were required to produce enough manure for the infields. This outfield-infield system of agriculture was accordingly based on the outfield resources but the land use varied between districts, depending on climate, geology and topography. The mountain areas have probably been used for summer farming since the Iron Age, and different types of forests have been used for grazing since farming was introduced. Coastal heathlands were gradually developed along the Atlantic coast with oceanic climate i.e. a long growing season and winters mild enough to permit year-round grazing. The fodder harvesting (as grazing, hay making, harvesting of leaf fodder, birch bark and lichens) strongly influenced the vegetation, creating open cultural landscapes and several different semi-natural vegetation types. Such unfertilised meadows and pastures with long continuity can be very species-rich. The landscape is dynamic and has changed through history due to variations in population pressure, political factors and ecological conditions. Still there has been a continuity in tools, agricultural techniques and the outfield-infield farming system from the Iron Age to the 19th and 20th century. However, when modern farming and artificial fertilisers were introduced around 1900, the production was enhanced and both food and fodder could be produced in the infields. The traditional usage of the outfields gradually ceased. These land-use changes have caused major landscape transformations especially after 1950. Abandoned areas are becoming overgrown with forest and many semi-natural vegetation types and species have gradually become rare and are now threatened. Field surveys and mapping of valuable cultural landscapes and biodiversity during the last years have given some information about the situation. However, better knowledge and monitoring of remaining areas of high conservation value is necessary to maintain the biodiversity of the cultural landscapes. The vegetation in Norway is in general naturally grazed, and continued grazing is needed to maintain plant species that have evolved together with grazers. However, there are few empirical studies on the effects of grazing on plant diversity, and most stud es are conducted on short temporal and small spatial scales. Grazed vegetation is generally more diverse as compared to ungrazed vegetation on a small (local) scale. The exception is low productive communities. A combination of grazed and ungrazed patches is expected to give the highest diversity on a large (landscape) scale. Hence, grazing will most likely increase plant species diversity on a large scale, although high densities of grazers could homogenise the vegetation, inducing a reduction in plant diversity especially in landscapes with low environmental variation. There is however a great lack of knowledge on the herbivore densities that are needed for maintaining high diversity both at local and regional scales, and thus maintain sustainable populations of vulnerable plant species and communities in different alpine, boreal and temperate systems. Environmental factors such as climate, productivity, soil pH and the historical land use are central for understanding grazing effects on diversity. Knowledge on plant resistance and tolerance and herbivore plant selection is essential to get a further understanding of how herbivores affect plant diversity. Today, sheep are the most important grazer in outlying land during summer, but an intermediate grazing pressure by sheep is not sufficient to stop forest succession in productive habitats in the long term. The four large herbivores in Norway (reindeer, red deer, moose and row deer) have increased during the last decades and would probably also depress forest succession, but we lack information on how grazing by several herbivores together (both cervids and livestock) with different plant selections will affect the vegetation. However, even though grazing restrain forest succession and contribute to the maintenance of species rich semi-natural plant communities, semi-natural communities experience a severe area reduction and populations of several plant species are currently being fragmented. Studies integrating both landscape and population levels are needed to obtain critical area-estimates for the maintenance of these species. We also need to know more about how grazing affects ecosystem processes such as primary production, nutrient turnover and disturbance, which indirectly affects the plants and thus may have a strong influence on plant diversity in the long term. The biological diversity in the cultural landscape has evolved over a long period of time and side by side by large carnivore populations. Gradually, shepherding became cost consuming, and the extensive use of the outfield ceased. As a result of these agricultural changes, the number of sheep and goat decreased by the end of the 19th century. When the carnivore populations decreased, the sheep farmers could adopt to a system based on extensive grazing with low levels of supervision. Again the densities of sheep grazing in Norwegian outfields increased, as well as the density of domestic reindeer, while there the densities of cattle and goats decreased. The resent abandonment of traditional agricultural use has lead to overgrowth and forest colonisation of the cultural landscape, and outfield sheep grazing is now the single factor contributing most to maintenance of the rural cultural landscapes and of what is left of biological diversity related to these landscapes. When the populations of large carnivores began to recover from 1980 on, carnivore depredation on livestock increased dramatically and Norway got the highest loss of sheep and reindeer per carnivore in Europe. Such levels of depredation are unacceptable, and several strategies aiming to lower the conflicts have been proposed, most of them related to sheep farming. We have considered the ecological consequences for the biological diversity in livestock grazing areas assuming that future densities of carnivores and herbivores will remain today's, as well as if carnivore management and/or grazing practise is altered. Our main conclusions are: Grazing discontinuance will lead to overgrowth and forest colonisation. If carnivore abundance leads to discontinuance of sheep grazing without this being replaced by other grazing animals or other type of maintenance, the overgrowth processes will accelerate and grassland vegetation and its species will become more rare or even disappear from the area. Shorter grazing season will enhance overgrowth and forest succession. In relation to the overgrowth problem, it is of special importance to start the grazing season early, since sheep prefer plants that are in an early growth phase. Livestock changes will result in vegetation changes. If livestock changes implies grazing in a smaller area, this will lead to overgrowth in the abandoned area. In some areas, a change from sheep to e.g. cattle or multispecies grazing may be favourable for biological diversity. In particular, this is favourable in areas where the grazing history includes cattle and multispecies grazing. Our knowledge about interactions between wild and domestic herbivores is limited. In some cases, canalisation of livestock grazing may prove favourable to biodiversity, in other cases it may prove disadvantageous. Moving or shepherding livestock as an attempt to lower the carnivore conflicts may be favourable to biodiversity if the grazers are lead from areas that may benefit from less grazing pressure to areas which tolerate or may benefit from a higher grazing pressure. However, such canalisation often implies grazing in a smaller area, which will result in larger abandoned areas subjected to overgrowth. If the animals are given fodder supplements, the vegetation in the grazing area may also be subjected to nutrition accumulation which may lower the biological diversity. Grazing in fertilised and manured arable infields will hardly promote biodiversity. Fertilised and manured arable fields are dominated by a few high productivity species, and threatened or vulnerable species are rarely represented. Herbivores will not contribute substantially to increase the biodiversity on such fields. Areas of special value and threatened species and habitats need special management. It is more difficult to restore than to maintain vegetation types with specially adapted species, and it may be difficult or impossible to restore the original diversity in heaths and grasslands once they are overgrown or fertilised and cultivated. Preserving a high plant diversity will not necessarily preserve rare and threatened plant species in all habitats. Moreover, plants are only one part of the biological diversity affected by grazing, and plant preservation may not automatically imply preservation of other organisms. For many species and species groups, the effect of grazing is poorly understood. We also lack knowledge about the density and the composition of herbivores that best will preserve the biological diversity in different types of vegetation. Preserving biological diversity requires holistic, overall evaluations. According to international agreements and national goals we are committed to ensure our biological diversity on all levels. Species in need of special care are present in all groups of species, and considerations to carnivores may come in conflict with considerations to other species or habitats we are committed to ensure. The present land use changes in Norway are comprehensive, in areas with large carnivores as well as in areas without, and the threats to semi-natural biological diversity are multiple. Furthermore, our knowledge about the effects of today's grazing regimes relative to historical land use is limited. This complex approach makes it difficult to extract one factor, such as presence of carnivores, from the others. Generally, the overall agricultural policy and the economical development will determine the farmers' future land use. We still conclude that carnivore management may have consequences upon other parts of the biological diversity if the results are changed land use, and that holistic evaluations are necessary to be able to choose management strategies which best ensures overall biodiversity. To ensure this on a regional and local scale, we need specific information about localities and species of special value. | ['austrheim', 'bruteig', 'norderhaug'] | ","['austrheim', 'bruteig', 'norderhaug']",4
282,"Reprint of Comparison of climate signals obtained from encrusting and free-living rhodolith coralline algae | Coralline algae have been used for sclerochronological studies throughout the last decade. These studies have focused on two different growth morphologies of the photosynthetic coralline algae: massive crusts forming small buildups on hard substrate, and free-living branching algal nodules, known as rhodoliths. The latter are generally found on soft-substrate, where they are frequently overturned by water movement and bottom feeding organisms, leaving one side of the rhodolith partially buried in the sediment at any given time. Here we test whether either of these growth morphologies is more suitable for proxy reconstructions by comparing Mg/Ca ratios - a temperature proxy - in multiple replicates of rhodoliths of Lithothamnion glaciale and in rhodoliths as well as encrusting specimens of Clathromorphum compactum. With both species being widespread throughout the Temperate and Arctic regions, we have chosen two North Atlantic localities at Nuuk Fjord, Greenland (Subarctic), and off the southeastern coast of Newfoundland, Canada (Temperate), for this study. Two to three Mg/Ca ratio transects spanning 18 years of growth were analysed on multiple specimens with encrusting morphologies and along different sides of rhodoliths using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry and compared to remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data. The length of the common time span used for comparison was limited by growth interruptions in rhodoliths. Furthermore, our comparison is based on the assumption that rhodolith growth increments are annual - an assumption that has recently been challenged by mesocosm studies. Monthly Mg/Ca values from multiple transects within each individual were compared and in samples from Nuuk fjord significant correlations were found in 4 of 4 encrusting C. compactum, 4 of 4 C. compactum rhodoliths, and 2 of 3 L. glaciale rhodoliths. In Newfoundland significant correlations were found in 6 of 6 encrusting C. compactum comparisons (average: r = 0.61, p < 0.001), and in 6 of 6 L. glaciale rhodolith comparisons (average: r= 0.43, p < 0.001) for monthly resolved time series. The monthly Mg/Ca ratios (n = 216) from each morphology were compared with instrumental Reynolds SST yielding the following correlations: encrusting C. compactum (r = 0.64, p < 0.001), C. compactum rhodolith (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) and L. glaciale (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). In Newfoundland both morphologies indicate a similar strength in recording SST: encrusting C. compactum (r = 0.85, p < 0.001) and rhodolith-forming L. glaciale (r= 0.84, p < 0.001). In summary, Mg/Ca ratios derived from both coralline algal growth forms can yield SST information, however, massive encrusting forms generally yield higher correlations to SST than transects measured on individual rhodoliths, which only allowed for the generation of short uninterrupted time series due to frequent growth irregularities. | ['blicher', 'halfar', 'hetzinger', 'juul', 'pedersen', 'williams', 'zack'] | ","['blicher', 'halfar', 'hetzinger', 'juul', 'pedersen', 'williams', 'zack']",0

284,"Responses of microbial phototrophs to late-Holocene environmental forcing of lakes in south-west Greenland | 1.The biological structure of arctic lakes is changing rapidly, apparently in response to global change processes such as increasing air temperatures, although altered nutrient stoichiometry may also be an important driver. Equally important, however, are local factors (e.g. landscape setting, hydrological linkages and trophic interactions) that may mediate responses of individual lakes at the regional scale. Despite general acknowledgement of the importance of local factors, there has been little focus on among-lake variability in the response to environmental change. 2.Sedimentary pigments, organic carbon and nitrogen, and biogenic silica (BSi) in 210Pb and 14C-dated sediment cores from three contrasting lakes in the Kangerlussuaq area (c.67 degrees N, 51 degrees W) of south-west Greenland were used to reconstruct algal and phototrophic bacterial ecological change during the late-Holocene. Water chemistry for the individual lakes varies in terms of conductivity (range: 303000Scm1) and stratification regimes (cold monomictic, dimictic and meromictic), linked with their position along the regional climate gradient from the coast and to the present ice sheet margin. 3.Despite essentially similar regional climate forcing over the last c.1000years, marked differences among lake types were observed in the phototrophic communities and their temporal variability. Considerable short-term variability occurred in an oligosaline, meromictic lake (SS1371), dominated by purple sulphur bacterial pigments, most likely due to a tight coupling between the position of the chemocline and the phototrophic community. Communities in a lake (SS86) located on a nunatak, just beyond the edge of the present ice sheet shifted in a nonlinear pattern, approximately 1000cal.years BP, possibly due to lake-level lowering and loss of outflow during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. This regime shift was marked by a substantial expansion of green sulphur bacteria. 4.A dilute, freshwater coastal lake (SS49) dominated by benthic algae was relatively stable until ca.1900 AD when rates of community change began to increase. These changes in benthic algal pigments are correlated with substantial declines (1.30.44 parts per thousand) in 15N that are indicative of increased deposition of atmospheric inputs of industrially derived NOx into the atmosphere. 5.Climate control on lake ecosystem functioning has been assumed to be particularly important in the Arctic. This study, however, illustrates a complex spatial response to climate forcing at the regional scale and emphasises differences in the relative importance of changes in the mass (m, both precipitation and nutrients) and energy flux (E) to lakes for the phototrophic community structure of low-arctic Greenland lakes. | ['anderson', 'fritz', 'reuss', 'simpson'] | ","['anderson', 'fritz', 'reuss', 'simpson']",0
285,"Response of tundra ecosystem in southwestern Alaska to Younger-Dryas climatic oscillation | Climatic warming during the last glacial-interglacial transition (LGIT) was punctuated by reversals to glacial-like conditions. Palaeorecords of ecosystem change can help document the geographical extent of these events and improve our understanding of biotic sensitivity to climatic forcing. To reconstruct ecosystem and climatic variations during the LGIT, we analyzed lake sediments from southwestern Alaska for fossil pollen assemblages, biogenic-silica content (BSiO2 %), and organic-carbon content (OC%). Betula shrub tundra replaced herb tundra as the dominant vegetation of the region around 13 600 cal BP (cal BP: (14) C calibrated calendar years before present), as inferred from an increase of Betula pollen percentages from < 5% to > 20% with associated decreases in Cyperaceae, Poaceae, and Artemisia . At c . 13 000 cal BP, a decrease of Betula pollen from 28 to < 5% suggests that shrub tundra reverted to herb tundra. Shrub tundra replaced herb tundra to resume as the dominant vegetation at 11 600 cal BP. Higher OC% and BSiO2 % values suggest more stable soils and higher aquatic productivity during shrub-tundra periods than during herb-tundra periods, although pollen changes lagged behind changes in the biogeochemical indicators before c . 13 000 cal BP. Comparison of our palaeoecological data with the ice-core ddelta(18) O record from Greenland reveals strikingly similar patterns from the onset through the termination of the Younger Dryas (YD). This similarity supports the hypothesis that, as in the North Atlantic region, pronounced YD climatic oscillations occurred in the North Pacific region. The rapidity and magnitude of ecological changes at the termination of the YD are consistent with greenhouse experiments and historic photographs demonstrating tundra sensitivity to climatic forcing. | ['henne', 'hu', 'kaufman', 'lee', 'nelson', 'yoneji'] | ","['henne', 'hu', 'kaufman', 'lee', 'nelson', 'yoneji']",0
286,"A review of diversification trends in diatom research with special reference to taxonomy and environmental applications using examples from Lake Baikal and elsewhere | The study of diatoms has diversified strongly since its beginnings in the 18(th) century. Early work focused upon collecting material for taxonomic analysis but by the mid 19(th) century a strong global perspective had already developed. In the 20(th) century, use of diatoms in biostratigraphy, environmental change and ecology and in biogeography proliferated as did work on diatom ultra structures, life cycles, and systematics. Most recently, systematics and molecular genetics have sought to reveal diatom genealogy and to refine taxonomy. Similarly, diatoms are used increasingly as time-space indicators of water quality and there is renewed interest in global diversity patterns. Taxonomy underpins these applications but changing concepts can either diminish or enhance the value of diatoms to the environmental sciences. Some ways in which taxonomic analysis of diatom assemblages I can benefit environmental research are discussed with reference to material from Lake Baikal and elsewhere. | ['flower'] | ",['flower'],4
287,"A revised chronology for aeolian activity in subarctic Fennoscandia during the Holocene | Detailed sedimentological studies and parallel sampling for C-14 and infra-red stimulated luminescence age assays were undertaken at six sites lying beyond and below the tree-line with the objective of establishing the historical development of aeolian landforms in Lapland. The main issues were: (a) the timing of dune activity and processes of stabilization: (b) the specific processes responsible For the past and contemporary activity. New data indicate that many of the primary dunes were active for several millennia after deglaciation. Diachronous stabilization at both local and regional scales appears likely. initial stabilization occurred in local interdune areas and where regional dune fields were colonized by pine (generally before 7 ka). Local large dunes and some regional dunefields only became stable around 4.3 ka, when the regional groundwater table rose and late pine colonization was possible. The latest episode of aeolian activity dates from AD 1100-1650 across the area. A unique deflation triggering Factor was not identifiable, suggesting that several agents acted in combination. Climate-vegetational parameters, especially the 'Little Ice Age' event, together with reindeer trampling, appear responsible Tor the continuing aeolian activity at the tundra sites. At the margin of the pine forest zone, forest fires may be the cause of aeolian reactivation. | ['clarke', 'kayhko', 'pye', 'worsley'] | ","['clarke', 'kayhko', 'pye', 'worsley']",0
288,"The River Alazeya: Shifting Socio-Ecological Systems Connected to a Northeastern Siberian River | One of the most remote Arctic locations, Andryushkino village of Yukaghir and Even peoples is located on the shore of the river Alazeya in northeastern Siberia, in the Lower Kolyma Republic of Sakha-Yakutia, Russia. The community is at the nexus of large-scale Arctic social and climate change resulting from economic shifts, permafrost melt events, and high temperatures. In this study, we approach Indigenous knowledge of climate impacts to water by investigating the role of the river Alazeya, which has enabled human life to thrive, given rise to the Indigenous governance of landscapes in the past, and today serves most of the Indigenous peoples in the region for their culture, food security, and well-being. To do this, we offer an ambitious system-change analysis of the socio-ecological context of the river basin and community by exploring oral histories recorded in the community between 2005 and 2020, combining them with relevant scientific literature and weather data from Russian measurement stations to detect and point to key messages of impacts. Our results confirm that the speed and extent of climate warming have increased since 1985. The flood event of 2007 in the village has especially been seen as a major climate change-induced catastrophe. We focus on the drivers of change from local history to present. We also investigate alternatives for future development of resilience and support for the Yukaghir culture, traditional ways of life, and language. | ['mustonen', 'shadrin'] | ","['mustonen', 'shadrin']",4
289,"Roads, forestry, and wolves interact to drive moose browsing behavior in Scandinavia | As wild ungulate densities increase across Europe and North America, plant-herbivore interactions are increasingly important from ecological and economic perspectives. These interactions are particularly significant where agriculture and forestry occur and where intensive grazing and browsing by wild ungulates can result in economic losses to growing crops and trees. We studied plant-herbivore interactions in a moose (Alces alces)-dominant system where forestry is a primary economy, the primary and secondary road networks are extensive, and wolves (Canis lupus) are recolonizing. Wolves and humans use low-traffic, secondary roads, yet roadsides provide high-quality and quantity browse for moose. Foraging theory predicts that moose will respond to riskier landscapes by selecting habitats that reduce predation risk, sacrificing feeding time or food quality. As food becomes limiting, however, animals will accept higher predation risk in search of food. We predicted that road avoidance behavior would be strongest within wolf territories. In areas without wolves, moose should select roadsides for their high forage availability. To test these predictions, we measured moose browsing and counted pellet groups as a proxy for habitat use each spring in Norway and Sweden between 2008 and 2018, in areas with and without wolves and at different distances from primary and secondary roads. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate drivers of the probability of browsing occurrence and browsing pressure. We found that browsing occurrence increased closer to secondary roads but decreased closer to primary roads. We also found browsing patterns to vary among tree species. For Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the browsing occurrence was two times higher in young forests relative to non-young forests and decreased further from secondary roads. Wolf territory presence and probability had neutral or positive effect on browsing occurrence and pressure for all species. However, wolf territory presence had negative effects on browsing occurrence and pressure when interacting with secondary roads, young forest, or snow cover. We showed that roads can influence browsing patterns in Norway and Sweden. However, further research is needed, particularly in the face of continued infrastructure development in Scandinavia. | ['cromsigt', 'devineau', 'loosen', 'mathisen', 'pfeffer', 'skarpe', 'zimmermann'] | ","['cromsigt', 'devineau', 'loosen', 'mathisen', 'pfeffer', 'skarpe', 'zimmermann']",4
290,"Rock glaciers in crystalline catchments: Hidden permafrost-related threats to alpine headwater lakes | A global warming-induced transition from glacial to periglacial processes has been identified in mountainous regions around the world. Degrading permafrost in pristine periglacial environments can produce acid rock drainage (ARD) and cause severe ecological damage in areas underlain by sulfide-bearing bedrock. Limnological and paleolimnological approaches were used to assess and compare ARDs generated by rock glaciers, a typical landform of the mountain permafrost domain, and their effects on alpine headwater lakes with similar morphometric features and underlying bedrock geology, but characterized by different intensities of frost action in their catchments during the year. We argue that ARD and its effects on lakes are more severe in the alpine periglacial belt with mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) between -2 degrees C and +3 degrees C, where groundwater persists in the liquid phase for most of the year, in contrast to ARD in the periglacial belt where frost action dominates (MAAT<-2 degrees C). The findings clearly suggest that the ambient air temperature is an important factor affecting the ARD production in alpine periglacial environments. Applying the paleoecological analysis of morphological abnormalities in chironomids through the past millennium, we tested and rejected the hypothesis that unfavorable conditions for aquatic life in the ARD-stressed lakes are largely related to the temperature increase over recent decades, responsible for the enhanced release of ARD contaminants. Our results indicate that the ARDs generated in the catchments are of a long-lasting nature and the frequency of chironomid morphological deformities was significantly higher during the Little Ice Age (LIA) than during pre- or post-LIA periods, suggesting that lower water temperatures may increase the adverse impacts of ARD on aquatic invertebrates. This highlights that temperature-mediated modulations of the metabolism and life cycle of aquatic organisms should be considered when reconstructing long-term trends in the ecotoxicological state of lakes. | ['ilyashuk', 'ilyashuk', 'koinig', 'psenner', 'tessadri'] | ","['ilyashuk', 'ilyashuk', 'koinig', 'psenner', 'tessadri']",0
291,"The role of climate change in regulating Arctic permafrost peatland hydrological and vegetation change over the last millennium | Climate warming has inevitable impacts on the vegetation and hydrological dynamics of high-latitude permafrost peatlands. These impacts in turn determine the role of these peatlands in the global biogeochemical cycle. Here, we used six active layer peat cores from four permafrost peatlands in Northeast European Russia and Finnish Lapland to investigate permafrost peatland dynamics over the last millennium. Testate amoeba and plant macrofossils were used as proxies for hydrological and vegetation changes. Our results show that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), Russian sites experienced short-term permafrost thawing and this induced alternating dry-wet habitat changes eventually followed by desiccation. During the Little Ice Age (LIA) both sites generally supported dry hummock habitats, at least partly driven by permafrost aggradation. However, proxy data suggest that occasionally, MCA habitat conditions were drier than during the LIA, implying that evapotranspiration may create important additionaleco-hydrological feedback mechanisms under warm conditions. All sites showed a tendency towards dry conditions as inferred from both proxies starting either from ca. 100 years ago or in the past few decades after slight permafrost thawing, suggesting that recent warming has stimulated surface desiccation rather than deeper permafrost thawing. This study shows links between two important controls over hydrology and vegetation changes in high-latitude peatlands: direct temperature-induced surface layer response and deeper permafrost layer-related dynamics. These data provide important backgrounds for predictions of Arctic permafrost peatlands and related feedback mechanisms. Our results highlight the importance of increased evapotranspiration and thus provide an additional perspective to understanding of peatland-climate feedback mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we generated a sedimentary ancient DNA dataset covering 10 lakes and applied novel methods for data harmonization. We assessed the impact of Holocene climate changes and nutrients on terrestrial plant richness in northern Fennoscandia. We find that richness increased steeply during the rapidly warming Early Holocene. In contrast to findings from most pollen studies, we show that richness continued to increase thereafter, although the climate was stable, with richness and the regional species pool only stabilizing during the past three millennia. Furthermore, overall increases in richness were greater in catchments with higher soil nutrient availability. We suggest that richness will increase with ongoing warming, especially at localities with high nutrient availability and assuming that human activity remains low in the region, although lags of millennia may be expected. | ['alm', 'alsos', 'bakke', 'brathen', 'brown', 'edward', 'goslar', 'heintzman', 'helmens', 'lammers', 'lorberau', 'murguzur', 'pitelkova', 'rijal', 'salonen', 'yoccoz'] | ","['alm', 'alsos', 'bakke', 'brathen', 'brown', 'edward', 'goslar', 'heintzman', 'helmens', 'lammers', 'lorberau', 'murguzur', 'pitelkova', 'rijal', 'salonen', 'yoccoz']",0

295,"Shieling Areas: Historical Grazing Pressures and Landscape Responses in Northern Iceland | Historical domestic livestock grazing in sensitive landscapes has commonly been regarded as a major cause of land degradation in Iceland. Shieling areas, where milking livestock were taken to pasture for the summer, represented one element of grazing management and in this paper we consider the extent to which historical shieling-based grazing pressure contributed to land degradation. Based on a grazing model to assess pressures and tephrochronology -based soil accumulation rates allied to micromorphology as a proxy for land degradation, our findings suggest that the shieling sy stem contributed to the maintenance of upland vegetation cover and related productivity levels without causing land degradation from settlement through to ca. AD 1300. As land degradation accelerated from ca. AD 1477 it is likely that shieling management continued to operate effectively contributing to the overall resilience of livestock farming. | ['adderley', 'brown', 'morrison', 'simpson', 'tisdall', 'vesteinsson'] | ","['adderley', 'brown', 'morrison', 'simpson', 'tisdall', 'vesteinsson']",2
296,"Similar patterns of change in stemwood calcium concentration in red spruce and Siberian fir | Changes in stemwood calcium concentration ([Ca]) for the last 120 years occurred in a common pattern for two sample collections of red spruce (n=33 and 20) from the northeastern United States and for one sample collection of Siberian fir (n=20) from southcentral Siberia, Russia. The [Ca] was measured for wood formed during the periods 1871-90, 1891-1910, 1911-30, 1931-50, 1951-70 and 1971-90. For each core, the relative increase or decrease in [Ca] for adjacent periods of wood formation was recorded. The relative frequency of positive change in [Ca] for each period of wood formation was calculated for the three sample collections. Previous research indicated that under equilibrium conditions, [Ca] in stemwood tended to decrease in more recently formed wood, due to declining numbers of Ca binding sites. Consequently, we expected a low frequency of positive changes in [Ca] in successively formed wood. Consistent with expectation, the relative frequency of positive change from the preceding period to the periods 1891-1910, 1911-30, 1931-50, and 1971-90 were low. Contrary to expectation, the frequency of positive increases in [Ca] more than doubled in 1951-70 compared to 1931-50. The frequency of positive increases in the 1951-70 period relative to the preceding period was 48%, significantly greater than all other periods (P less than or equal to 0.01). The frequencies of positive increases for all other periods were not significantly different from each other (overall mean = 21%, SD = 7). This anomaly in the frequency of positive change in [Ca] in wood formed in 1951-70 relative to wood formed in 1931-50 indicated a perturbation in the ion exchange chemistry of stemwood in two widely separated parts of the northern coniferous forest. This anomaly could be due to external or internal factors. Changes in sap chemistry that affected stemwood chemistry could have been due to changes in the rooting zone. Such changes in rooting zone chemistry could result from the atmospheric deposition of ionic pollutants. Other external factors that could cause the observed anomaly include unusual climatic periods or environmental disturbances such as logging or fire. Internal factors that might produce an anomalously high frequency of positive change of [Ca] include heartwood formation, stemwood infection and a hypersensitive response of the tree against infection. | ['alexeyev', 'minocha', 'shortle', 'smith'] | ","['alexeyev', 'minocha', 'shortle', 'smith']",1
297,"Simulating vegetation cover dynamics with regards to long-term climatic variations in sub-arctic landscapes | Iceland is facing severe land degradation in many parts of the country. This study aims to increase the understanding of the complex interactions and interconnectivity between the critical factors that help maintain the land degradation processes in sub-arctic environments. A holistic approach in the form of a causal loop diagram (CLD) is applied for diagnosing the influencing factors. To further study the relationship between vegetation cover and its degradation, a dynamic model that uses a long-term temperature data as the main indicator function is constructed to simulate potential vegetation cover during the Holocene. The results depict an oscillating vegetation cover. Gradual degradation in potential vegetation cover begins ca. 3000 BP and accelerates greatly after ca. 2500 BP. From the time of the Norse settlement in the latter halve of the 9th century to present time, the simulated vegetation cover retreats ca. 25% in relation to climatic cooling. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

298,"Sobol' sensitivity analysis of the Holocene Peat Model: What drives carbon accumulation in peatlands? | Understanding the development of northern peatlands and their carbon accumulation dynamics is crucial in order to confidently integrate northern peatlands into global carbon cycle models. To achieve this, northern peatland models are becoming increasingly complex and now include feedback processes between peat depth, decomposition, hydrology, and vegetation composition and productivity. Here we present results from a global sensitivity analysis performed to assess the behavior and parameter interaction of a peatland simulation model. A series of simulations of the Holocene Peat Model were performed with different parameter combinations in order to assess the role of parameter interactions on the simulated total carbon mass after 5000 years of peatland development. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the simulation results is highlighted, as is the importance of multiple parameter interactions. The model sensitivity indicates that peat physical properties play an important role in peat accumulation; these parameters are poorly constrained by observations and should be a focus of future research. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic processes are able to produce a wide range of peatland development behaviors independently of any external environmental changes.

In order to assess human impact on soils soil quality, soil organic C (SOC), soil bulk density (BD), soil moisture content (SMC), soil mass, and SOC sequestration were measured from two Histosol cores in West Iceland. The cores cover a period from around 665 BC to present, capturing the initial human settlement of Iceland in AD 871. Tephrochronology allowed for a reliable correlation and comparison between the two cores. The initial settlement had profound impacts on the soil quality, causing decreased SOC concentration and SMC, and increased vegetation degradation, soil exposure, eolian deposition, and BD. The total SOC pool was 34.6 kg C m(2) at one of the sites, of which 60.1% was formed during historic times, driven by increased soil mass deposition from surrounding eroded areas. The SOC pool was 43.7 kg C m(2) at the other site, of which 31.4% was formed during historic time, constrained by water cycling and decomposition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

301,"Soils in Karst Sinkholes Record the Holocene History of Local Forest Fires at the North of European Russia | Despite the abundance of charcoal material entrapped in soils, they remain relatively less studied pyrogenic archives in comparison to the sedimentary paleofire records (e.g., lacustrine and peat deposits), and that is especially the case in most of Russia's territory. We report here on the deep soil archives of the Holocene forest fires from the Pinega District of the Arkhangelsk region (64.747 degrees N, 43.387 degrees E). Series of buried soil profiles separated by charcoal layers and clusters were revealed in specific geomorphological traps represented by the active and paleokarst subsidence sinkholes on sulfate rocks overlaid by glacial and fluvial deposits. We combine the study of soil morphology and stratigraphy with a set of radiocarbon data on charcoal and soil organic matter, as well as the anthracomass analysis, to extract a set of paleoenvironmental data. A total of 45 radiocarbon dates were obtained for the macrocharcoal material and the soil organic matter. The maximum temporal ""depth"" of archives estimated from the radiocarbon dating of macrocharcoal reached 10,260 +/- 35 cal yr BP. Soil formation with Podzols established at the inter-pyrogenic stages repeatedly reproduced within the period of ten thousand years, while the dominant tree species was Pinus sp. According to the macrocharcoal data, the intervals between fires have shortened in the last thousand years. Dendrochronological estimates suggest the occurrence of fires in almost every decade of the 20th and early 21st centuries.

Another set of analyses from the same region, published elsewhere, is reported for comparison. The analyses were performed on small increments along the length of the hairs providing information about short(seasonal) and long-term (before and after the Last Glacial maximum) diet variation and, hence, about the environment in which the mammoths lived. The mean 613 C and 615 N values for the four sites range between -24.1 parts per thousand and -20.9 parts per thousand and between 5.8 parts per thousand and 9.6 parts per thousand, respectively. Both the delta C-13 and 615 N signals increment towards east when samples from the same age are considered. Hair delta N-15 correlates well with the current amount of precipitation independently of the radiocarbon age of the sample. This could mean that during the periods considered this environmental parameter did not change significantly in the studied sites. Hair delta C-13 appears to be affected by a different environmental factor that, in this case, varies in function of the radiocarbon age of the samples. This factor could be the CO2 atmospheric content that, as is well know, varies across a glacial cycle depending on temperature. The isotope patterns obtained from each set of samples exhibit roughly sinusoidal oscillations of the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. These oscillations have been attributed to seasonal changes in the isotope values of the mammoth's diet due to plant adaptation to the different seasonal environmental conditions or to the different seasonal plant type availability. A direct physiological effect on the hair delta N-15 values can also be considered. This study strongly supports the possibility of using hair delta C-13 and delta N-15 signals as indicators of geographical and temporal variation in plant isotope composition and, ultimately, as indicators of palacoclimate changes.

305,"C and N stable isotope measurements on Eurasian fossil mammals, 40 000 to 10 000 years BP: Herbivore physiologies and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction | Seventy-seven specimens of fossil (Upper Pleistocene-Early Holocene) woolly mammoth, reindeer, deer and bison from 17 different locations in Eurasia have been measured for the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope composition of their collagen and for the carbon stable isotope composition of bioapatite. The aim was: (1) to check the existence of differences in N and C isotope ratios between and within different herbivore species (mainly between mammoth and reindeer); (2) to discuss these data in terms of animal physiology, temporal and spatial distribution of animals and effects of climatic changes; and (3) to obtain further information about the environmental changes that occurred in that area during the period considered. A geographical variation from south-west to north-east in the delta15N and/or delta13C values of collagen and bioapatite for all the herbivore species is apparent, the most negative delta13C values and the most positive delta15N values being located in the north-eastern area. This was probably due to a different temperature and water stress on animals and plants and to a different plant availability. The differences in 13C/12C and 15N/14N isotope ratios among species are mainly related to different food intake and different metabolic pathways. It seems also that the diet of mammoths from north-eastern Siberia was higher in protein content compared with that of mammoths from the Russian Plain. From this study, it is clear that there was a rapid and important change in the amount of precipitation soon after the last glacial maximum; the rainfall conditions around 40 000 and 30 000 years BP were probably similar to those existing around 10 000 years BP, though lower than those existing after the glacial maximum. | ['iacumin', 'nikolaev', 'ramigni'] | ","['iacumin', 'nikolaev', 'ramigni']",3

There was a modest, temporary appearance of anthropogenically-induced vegetation about 8600 cal bp. After 7100 cal bp there was a development towards semi-open birch woodland where the open patches were characterised by natural heath and meadow species and more typical apophytic taxa such as Ranunculus acris and Rumex acetosa types, grasses and juniper. The main changes towards this vegetation seem connected with the most important cultural changes, especially at about 7100 cal bp, when there was a transition to honed slate tools in the regional archaeology, at about 4000 cal bp when pottery was introduced, and at about 3000 - 2800 cal bp since when the use of stone artefacts gradually ceased.

308,"Strategies of Growth and Population Dynamics of Tundra Plants Part 1 Introduction | Studies of plants growing in tundra regions have tended to concentrate either upon whole plant communities or upon the physiology and metabolism of above-or below-ground plant organs considered separately. It is suggested that detailed physiological studies, especially of the fixation and conservation of energy, can be integrated within the framework of the life cycle of the whole plant. When combined with information on reproductive biology and population dynamics, and construction of a long term framework is possible within which short-term processes involving individual plant organs can be interpreted. Tundra plants are particularly amenable to this treatment. Clear innate markers of annual growth (caused by marked seasonality in climate) and slow decomposition rates result in the preservation of records of the past history of individual plants and the populations of which they were part. | ['callaghan', 'collins'] | ","['callaghan', 'collins']",4

These sensitivity experiments remind us that model quality or realism is not only a function of model parameterizations and tunings but also of experimental setup. The transient simulations shows that the long-term trends in temperature and precipitation have a similar shape to the insolation forcing, except at the Equator, at high latitudes, and south of 40ƒù S. In these regions cloud cover, sea ice, snow, or ocean heat content feedbacks lead to smaller or opposite temperature responses. The long-term trend in tree line in the Northern Hemisphere is reproduced and starts earlier than the southward shift in vegetation over the Sahel. Despite little change in forest cover over Eurasia, a long-term change in forest composition is simulated, including large centennial variability. The rapid increase in atmospheric CO2</span> in the last centuries of the simulation enhances tree growth and counteracts the long-term trends induced by Holocene insolation in the Northern Hemisphere and amplifies it in the Southern Hemisphere. We also highlight some limits in the evaluation of such a simulation resulting from model climate-vegetation biases, the difficulty of fully assessing the result for preindustrial or modern conditions that are affected by land use, and the possibility of multi-vegetation states under modern conditions. ¬© 2019.

310,"Strong correlation between summer temperature and pollen accumulation rates for Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Betula spp. in a high-resolution record from northern Sweden | Highly resolved pollen spectra analysed from a 47 cm peat monolith recovered from a mire in northern Sweden exhibit climatic sensitivity in the pollen accumulation rates (PAR) of boreal treeline species. Robust temporal control, afforded through multiple AMS radiocarbon dating of the post-atomic-bomb-test period (AD 1961-2002), provides a unique opportunity to compare pollen accumulation rates with the instrumental meteorological record. Strong correlations are observed between summer temperature and PAR for Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Betula spp. (excluding B. nana). Despite well constrained, contiguous ('annual') sampling, the ternporal resolution of the pollen signal preserved within each sample appears to be degraded to ca. 3-5 year resolution. This is likely to reflect processes occurring during peat accumulation and pollen deposition, as well as dating uncertainties and the effects of subsampling. These findings identify limitations to the maximum resolution that may realistically be recovered from the peat archive using high-resolution sampling protocols and AMS C-14 dating. We also identify the need for additional work to quantify the role of climate on peat accumulation and the resultant impact on assemblage-based palaeoenvironmental reconstructions within mire sequences. The strongest climate association observed for Picea abies (r(adjusted)(2) = 0.53; n = 36) was extended through the monolith beyond the 42 year period of 'annual' sampling and the response successfully correlated with the Bottenviken historical instrumental record to AD 1860. Although only presenting data from a single site, and requiring wider replication, we conclude that for sites close to the ecological limits of tree species, where levels of anthropogenic/non-climatic forcing on pollen production are low, well-dated records of PAR may potentially provide a proxy for reconstructing past summer temperature variability.

311,"Subfossil oribatid mite communities indicate Holocene permafrost dynamics in Canadian mires | Permafrost thaw in peatlands is one of the most widespread and worrying consequences of climate warming in the sub-Arctic area. To predict future climate feedbacks, it is important to study the history of permafrost aggradation and thaw. Plant macrofossil analysis with radiocarbon dating has been widely used in detecting past permafrost dynamics in peatlands, however, due to a lack of permafrost-specific plant indicator species, determining the exact timing of permafrost aggradation remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated if oribatid mites can be used to determine Holocene permafrost aggradation and degradation in Canadian mires. Based on analyses of subfossil oribatid mite assemblages of Holocene peat profiles from two mires in the Hudson Bay Lowlands area, our results suggest that two species, Carabodes labyrinthicus and Neoribates aurantiacus, are useful bioindicators, which can be used in palaeoecological studies determining permafrost histories. Moreover, our results show that subfossil oribatid mite remains can reveal periods of permafrost, which cannot be determined with certainty based on plant macrofossils alone. | ['kuhry', 'markkula'] | ","['kuhry', 'markkula']",0
312,"Succession in the Hudson Bay Lowland, Northern Ontario, Canada | The hypothesis that successional pathways converge onto climax bog communities is tested in the Hudson Bay lowland of Canada using both chronosequence data and paleoecological reconstruction. A chronosequence of different age surfaces has resulted from land emergence out of Hudson Bay due to isostatic rebound during the late Holocene. The chronosequence results, based on remote-sensing data and ground surveys, indicate that successional pathways beginning on moist sites (mesoseres) and on dry sites (xeroseres) support quite different vegetation types on the youngest age surfaces, but ultimately converge onto Sphagnum bog communities which dominate the older ( gt 4000 yr) surfaces. The vegetation changes based on paleoecological reconstruction of a peat profile from a Sphagnum bog on a 4100 yr BP surface in the Hudson Bay lowland shows strong similarities to the present day vegetation along the regional chronosequence. The development of the Hudson Bay lowland appears to be primarily under the control of succession coupled with surface hydrology and, perhaps, climate. This result suggests that the pollen record may be more a reflection of a coupling of successional and environmental processes rather than externally forced climate changes. This work points to the critical need for understanding the contribution of succession (coupled with climate, soils, and hydrology) in the interpretation of paleoecological data. | ['klinger', 'short'] | ","['klinger', 'short']",0
313,"Surface wetness and mire development during the late Holocene in central Sweden | Late Holocene mire development and surface wetness changes have been studied in a small mixed mire located in central Sweden. Today the mire is characterized by a mainly ombrotrophic centre dominated by Sphagnum mosses, with Carex content increasing towards the more minerotrophic mire margins. Two peat sequences extracted from the central ombrotrophic part were investigated for stratigraphy, humification, testate amoebae analysis, C/N ratio and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes. Three main stages of mire development are identified, with the first stage, between c. 4200 and 2600 cal. yr BP, characterized by water-logged conditions, suggesting a minerotrophic fen stage. The second stage, between c. 2600 and 1000 cal. yr BP, is characterized by more ombrotrophic conditions and Sphagnum-dominated vegetation. The onset of the prominent change at c. 2600 cal. yr BP could have been initiated by climate change coincident with a change in solar activity. The last stage, between c. 1000 and 50 cal. yr BP, is dominated by more ombrotrophic conditions, suggesting increased precipitation. This study shows that the response of hydrological proxies in a mixed mire during its development towards more ombrotrophic conditions might result in conflicting results, a finding that needs to be considered in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from mires that change between ombrotrophic and minerotrophic settings. | ['andersson', 'schoning'] | ","['andersson', 'schoning']",1
314,"Synchronous changes in chironomid assemblages in two Arctic delta lake ecosystems after a major saltwater intrusion event | Low-lying Arctic coastal environments are threatened by marine storm surges, which are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of decreasing sea ice, rising sea levels and altered intensity and frequency of storm activity. The Mackenzie Delta of Canada's Northwest Territories, a vast, low-lying wetland ecosystem, is particularly susceptible to such storm surges, because much of the outer alluvial plain is below 2-m elevation. A large storm-surge event in September 1999 flooded > 13,000 ha of alluvial terrain and impacted the terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems of the region. Previous research on the limnological impacts of the storm surge recorded a shift from freshwater to brackish diatom taxa, and a change in cladoceran assemblages to more saline-tolerant species. We examined the remains of Chironomidae (Insecta, Diptera) in sediment cores from two lakes impacted by the 1999 saltwater inundation to determine whether the storm surge also affected benthic macroinvertebrate communities, which are particularly important to lake ecosystem function in Arctic regions. We observed an increase in the relative abundance of saline-tolerant taxa in the two impacted lakes, including Paratanytarsus and Cricotopus/Orthocladius, and decreases in saline-intolerant Sergentia and Corynocera oliveri-type, coincident with the 1999 storm. We observed no major assemblage changes after 1999 in a control lake located beyond the zone of inundation. The number of head capsules recovered from sediments of the impacted lakes increased after the 1999 storm, suggesting no negative impact on overall chironomid abundance as a result of the shift to brackish conditions. There has, however, been no recovery of the chironomid community to the pre-1999 composition. Earlier assemblage changes in both impacted lakes likely tracked regional climate warming in the region, known to have begun in the late nineteenth century. | ['kokelj', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'steele', 'thienpont', 'vermaire'] | ","['kokelj', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'steele', 'thienpont', 'vermaire']",4
315,"Temperature-controlled tundra fire severity and frequency during the last millennium in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska | Wildfire is an important disturbance to Arctic tundra ecosystems. In the coming decades, tundra fire frequency, intensity, and extent are projected to increase because of anthropogenic climate change. To more accurately predict the effects of climate change on tundra fire regimes, it is critical to have detailed knowledge of the natural frequency and extent of past wildfires and how they responded to past climate variability. We present analyses of fire frequency and temperature from a lake sediment core from the Yukon-Kuskokwim (YK) Delta. Our ca. 1000 macroscopic charcoal record shows more frequent but possibly less severe tundra fires during the first half of the last millennium, whereas less frequent, possibly more severe fires characterize the latter half. Our temperature reconstruction, based on distributional changes of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), shows slightly warmer conditions from ca. AD 1000 to 1500, and cooler conditions thereafter (ca. AD 1500 to 2000), suggesting that fire frequency increases when climate is relatively warmer in this region. When wildfires occur more frequently, fire severity may decrease because of limited biomass (fuel source) accumulating between fires. The data suggest that tundra ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change, and that a warmer climate, which is predicted to develop in the near future, will result in more frequent tundra wildfires. | ['holmes', 'mann', 'natali', 'russell', 'sae', 'lim', 'schade', 'vachula'] | ","['holmes', 'mann', 'natali', 'russell', 'sae', 'lim', 'schade', 'vachula']",4

317,"Temporal and spatial patterns of mitochondrial haplotype and species distributions in Siberian larches inferred from ancient environmental DNA and modeling | Changes in species' distributions are classically projected based on their climate envelopes. For Siberian forests, which have a tremendous significance for vegetation-climate feedbacks, this implies future shifts of each of the forest-forming larch (Larix) species to the north-east. However, in addition to abiotic factors, reliable projections must assess the role of historical biogeography and biotic interactions. Here, we use sedimentary ancient DNA and individual-based modelling to investigate the distribution of larch species and mitochondrial haplotypes through space and time across the treeline ecotone on the southern Taymyr peninsula, which at the same time presents a boundary area of two larch species. We find spatial and temporal patterns, which suggest that forest density is the most influential driver determining the precise distribution of species and mitochondrial haplotypes. This suggests a strong influence of competition on the species' range shifts. These findings imply possible climate change outcomes that are directly opposed to projections based purely on climate envelopes. Investigations of such fine-scale processes of biodiversity change through time are possible using paleoenvironmental DNA, which is available much more readily than visible fossils and can provide information at a level of resolution that is not reached in classical palaeoecology. | ['epp', 'herzschuh', 'kath', 'kruse', 'pestryakova', 'stoof', 'leichsenring', 'tiedemann'] | ","['epp', 'herzschuh', 'kath', 'kruse', 'pestryakova', 'stoof', 'leichsenring', 'tiedemann']",1

Simulated biome distributions using BIOME4 driven by HadCM3 and FAMOUS at the global scale over time generally agree well with those inferred from pollen data. Global average areas of grassland and dry shrubland, desert, and tundra biomes show large-scale increases during the Last Glacial Maximum, between ca. 64 and 74 ka BP and cool substages of Marine Isotope Stage 5, at the expense of the tropical forest, warm-temperate forest, and temperate forest biomes. These changes are reflected in BIOME4 simulations of global net primary productivity, showing good agreement between the two models. Such changes are likely to affect terrestrial carbon storage, which in turn influences the stable carbon isotopic composition of seawater as terrestrial carbon is depleted in C-13. | ['allen', 'anderson', 'behling', 'bhagwat', 'borisova', 'bush', 'correa', 'metrio', 'finch', 'frechette', 'gosling', 'granoszewski', 'grimm', 'gruger', 'hanselman', 'harrison', 'hill', 'hoogakker', 'huntley', 'jimenez', 'moreno', 'kershaw', 'ledru', 'lozano', 'garcia', 'magri', 'marchant', 'mckenzie', 'muller', 'nakagawa', 'novenko', 'penny', 'prentice', 'sadori', 'scott', 'singarayer', 'smith', 'stevenson', 'tzedakis', 'valdes', 'vandergoes', 'velichko', 'whitlock', 'de', 'vernal'] | ","['allen', 'anderson', 'behling', 'bhagwat', 'borisova', 'bush', 'correa', 'metrio', 'finch', 'frechette', 'gosling', 'granoszewski', 'grimm', 'gruger', 'hanselman', 'harrison', 'hill', 'hoogakker', 'huntley', 'jimenez', 'moreno', 'kershaw', 'ledru', 'lozano', 'garcia', 'magri', 'marchant', 'mckenzie', 'muller', 'nakagawa', 'novenko', 'penny', 'prentice', 'sadori', 'scott', 'singarayer', 'smith', 'stevenson', 'tzedakis', 'valdes', 'vandergoes', 'velichko', 'whitlock', 'de', 'vernal']",4
319,"Testate amoeba records indicate regional 20th-century lowering of water tables in ombrotrophic peatlands in central-northern Alberta, Canada | Testate amoebae are abundant in the surface layers of northern peatlands. Analysis of their fossilized shell (test) assemblages allows for reconstructions of local water-table depths (WTD). We have reconstructed WTD dynamics for five peat cores from peatlands ranging in distance from the Athabasca bituminous sands (ABS) region in western Canada. Amoeba assemblages were combined with plant macrofossil records, acid-insoluble ash (AIA) fluxes and instrumental climate data to identify drivers for environmental change. Two functional traits of testate amoebae, mixotrophy and the tendency to integrate xenogenic mineral matter in test construction, were quantified to infer possible effects of AIA flux on testate amoeba presence. Age-depth models showed the cores each covered at least the last ~315 years, with some spanning the last millennium. Testate amoeba assemblages were likely affected by permafrost development in two of the peatlands, yet the most important shift in assemblages was detected after 1960 CE. This shift represents a significant apparent lowering of water tables in four out of five cores, with a mean drop of ~15 cm. Over the last 50 years, assemblages shifted towards more xerophilous taxa, a trend which was best explained by increasing Sphagnum s. Acutifolia and, to a lesser extent, mean summer temperature. This trend was most evident in the two cores from the sites located farthest away from the ABS region. AIA flux variations did not show a clear effect on mineral-agglutinating taxa, nor on S. s. Acutifolia presence. We therefore suggest the drying trend was forced by the establishment of S. s. Acutifolia, driven by enhanced productivity following regional warming. Such recent apparent drying of peatlands, which may only be reconstructed by appropriate indicators combined with high chronological control, may affect vulnerability to future burning and promote emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>. | ['bellen', 'davy', 'froese', 'garneau', 'magnan', 'mullan', 'boudreau', 'shotyk', 'zaccone'] | ","['bellen', 'davy', 'froese', 'garneau', 'magnan', 'mullan', 'boudreau', 'shotyk', 'zaccone']",3
320,"Testate amoeba as palaeohydrological indicators in the permafrost peatlands of north-east European Russia and Finnish Lapland | To explore the use of testate amoeba for investigating the impacts of climate change on permafrost peatland hydrology, we established a new modern training set from Arctic permafrost peatlands in north-east European Russia and Finnish Lapland. Ordination analyses showed that water-table depth (WTD) was the most important control on testate amoeba distribution. We developed a new testate amoeba-based WTD transfer function and thoroughly tested it. We found that our transfer function had strong predictive power. The best-performing model was based on tolerance-downweighted weighted averaging with inverse deshrinking (R-2 = 0.77, RMSEP = 5.62 cm with leave-one-out cross validation). The new transfer function was applied to a short peat core from Arctic Russia and revealed two major hydrological shifts, which could be validated against plant macrofossil data. We also compared our model to another two models from more temperate peatlands. Comparison of the different testate amoeba datasets suggests that testate amoeba ecohydrological relationships are similar for permafrost peatlands to those in more temperate regions, but there are some differences that suggest a need for training datasets that are fully representative of permafrost peatlands.

321,"Thermophilic tree species reinvade subalpine Sweden - Early responses to anomalous late holocene climate warming | Consistent with general predictions and earlier empirical studies, it appears that recent climate warming has started to affect large-scale biogeographical patterns in northern Sweden. Long-term, systematic monitoring in permanent altitudinal belt transects reveals spread of broadleaved thermophilic tree species with quite different life histories into the subalpine forest belt. Saplings of Quercus robur, Ulmus glabra, Acer platanoides, Alnus glutinosa, and Betula pendula have responded to altered climatic conditions by jump-dispersal in the order of 50-300 km northwards and 500-800 m upwards. Thereby, they have reinvaded elevations where they grew during the warmest phase of the Holocene, 9500-8000 years ago, but were subsequently extirpated by Neoglacial cooling. Confined to the past 15 years or so, these unique observations are consistent with background climatic data, i.e. warming of all seasons. The results contribute to more realistic vegetation models by stressing that at least certain plant species are able to track climate warming without substantial migration lag. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],4
322,"Total photosynthetic biomass record between 9400 and 2200 BP and its link to temperature changes at a High Arctic site near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard | Changes in vegetation biomass have a great impact on many aspects of the Arctic ecosystem, and historical variations of biomass in Svalbard during the Holocene remain poorly understood. In this study, we collected a palaeo-notch sediment profile in Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard, performed organic biomarker and geochemical analysis on the sediments, reconstructed the photosynthetic biomass record during the interval of 9400-2200 BP, and examined the relationship between the photosynthetic biomass changes and Holocene temperature records in the Arctic region. The photosynthetic biomass production in Ny-angstrom lesund experienced four development periods. It rose steadily at the beginning of the Holocene and became stabilized at a high level during the Holocene thermal maximum. However, the photosynthetic biomass dropped sharply during the mid-Holocene transition. After that, it showed a small peak during the interval of 3000-2500 BP. The historical photosynthetic biomass record is in good agreement with the temperature records: the photosynthetic biomass production increases during warmer periods, and vice versa. Therefore, temperature is likely the driving factor controlling the photosynthetic biomass production. This study improves our understanding of the terrestrial ecosystem and its responses to climate change in the Arctic. | ['cheng', 'sun', 'wang', 'wang', 'xie', 'yang', 'yuan'] | ","['cheng', 'sun', 'wang', 'wang', 'xie', 'yang', 'yuan']",3
323,"Trace metal profiles in the varved sediment of an Arctic lake | Varved (annually-laminated) sediments offer a rare and physically undisturbed archive of past trace metal deposition and limnological conditions. Here, a high-resolution 1,300 year record of metal accumulation is presented from a varved lake sediment on Devon Island in the Canadian High Arctic. Down-core concentration profiles of Cd, Cu and Zn were positively correlated (P < 0.01) with organic C (Cd, Zn) or with leachable Fe (Cu), while distinct sub-surface peaks of these metals coincided with those of Fe, S and other redox-sensitive elements such as Co, Cr and U. The fluxes of these metals since 1854 were correlated with elements such as Ca, Al and La (P < 0.001) which are predominantly of local geological origin. Furthermore, the Cd, Cu and Zn patterns did not match concurrent records in Greenland Summit ice over the last century, nor global industrial emission histories. These facts suggest that inputs from local geological sources, coupled with some degree of post-depositional mobility or association with organic matter inputs, explain the metals' sedimentary profiles, which were apparently not affected by long-range atmospheric metal pollution. Mercury concentrations were strongly correlated with total diatom abundance over the last 400 yrs, especially during the 20th Century when a two-fold increase in Hg concentrations and a four order-of-magnitude increase in diatoms occurred in tandem. Since 1854, 81% of the variation in Hg flux was associated with diatom and Ca fluxes. A similar correspondence between Hg and diatoms was found in a second lake nearby, confirming that the relationship was not unique to the main study lake. Recent Hg increases in Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes have been attributed to global anthropogenic Hg emissions. We propose an alternative hypothesis for High Arctic lakes: the recent Hg increases may be partly or entirely the product of elevated rates of Hg scavenging from the water column caused by markedly greater algal productivity, which in turn was driven by accelerating climate warming during the 20th Century. Given the important environmental assessment and policy implications if the alternative hypothesis is true, the possible effects of climate warming on sedimentary Hg fluxes in this region deserve further study.

324,"Tracking long-term changes in climate using algal indicators in lake sediments | Interest in climate change research has taken on new relevance with the realization that human activities, such as the accelerated release of the so-called greenhouse gases, may be altering the thermal properties of our atmosphere. Important social, economic, and scientific questions include the following. Is climate changing? If so, can these changes be related to human activities? Are episodes of extreme weather, such as droughts or hurricanes, increasing in frequency? Long-term meteorological data, on broad spatial and temporal scales, are needed to answer these questions. Unfortunately, such data were never gathered; therefore, indirect proxy methods must be used to infer past climatic trends. A relatively untapped source of paleoclimate data is based on hindcasting past climatic trends using the environmental optima and tolerances of algae (especially diatoms) preserved in lake sediment profiles. Paleophycologists have used two approaches. Although still controversial, attempts have been made to directly infer climatic variables, such as temperature, from past algal assemblages. The main assumption with these types of analyses is that species composition is either directly related to temperature or that algal assemblages are related to some variable linearly related to temperature. The second more commonly used approach is to infer a limnological variable (e.g. water chemistry, lake ice cover, etc.) that is related to climate. Although paleolimnological approaches are broadly similar across climatic regions, the environmental gradients that paleophycologists track can be very different. For example, climatic inferences in polar regions have focused on past lake ice conditions, whereas in lakes near arctic treeline ecotones, paleophycologists have developed methods to infer past lakewater-dissolved organic carbon, because this variable has been linked to the density of coniferous trees in a drainage basin. In closed-basin lakes in arid and semiarid regions, past lakewater salinity, which can be robustly reconstructed from fossil algal assemblages, is closely tied to the balance of evaporation and precipitation (i.e. drought frequency). Some recent examples of paleophycolgical work include the documentation of striking environmental changes in high arctic environments in the 19th century believed to be related to climate warming. Meanwhile, diatom-based reconstructions of salinity (e.g. the Great Plains of North America and Africa) have revealed prolonged periods of droughts over the last few millennia that have greatly exceeded those recorded during recent times. Marked climatic variability that is outside the range captured by the instrumental record has a strong bearing on sustainability of human societies. Only with a long-term perspective can we understand natural climatic variability and the potential influences of human activities on climate and thereby increase our ability to understand future climate. | ['cumming', 'smol'] | ","['cumming', 'smol']",0
325,"Tracking the long-term responses of diatoms and cladocerans to climate warming and human influences across lakes of the Ring of Fire in the Far North of Ontario, Canada | The extensive peatlands and lakes of the Far North of Ontario warrant committed scientific attention given their status as a significant carbon sink. Economic interest in this region has recently increased due to the discovery of vast mineral deposits (mainly chromite and nickel) known as the ""Ring of Fire''. Mineral exploration and infrastructure planning are underway, but environmental monitoring is only beginning. Detailed baseline ecological information is required to assess the impacts of future resource extraction within the context of multiple environmental stressors (including recent regional climate warming). Here we use sediment cores from two relatively deep lakes (Zmax [approximately] 10 m) and two shallow lakes (Zmax [approximately] 2 m), all located in the vicinity of the Ring of Fire, to examine biotic responses to warming prior to the commencement of mining activities. Our data show that, over the past [approximately]150 years, diatom and cladoceran sedimentary assemblages have transitioned from dominance by littoral/benthic forms to greater abundances of planktonic cladoceran (an increase of [approximately]3 to 34 %) and diatom taxa (an increase of [approximately]3 to 22 %). Increased relative abundances of planktonic taxa are consistent with warming-induced changes in lake properties including longer ice-free periods and increased production by planktonic algae. The response of diatom assemblages in shallow lakes to warming preceded the deeper lakes by [approximately]45 to 60 years, and substantial increases in aquatic production ([approximately]4 to 15 times higher than in sediments deposited prior to 1900) were observed in the shallow lakes, in agreement with previous analyses demonstrating the heightened sensitivity of shallow systems to climate warming. These data provide important information necessary to distinguish potential ecological impacts related to resource extraction from natural variation and the ongoing responses to regional climate warming. | ['hargan', 'jeziorski', 'keller', 'nelligan', 'paterson', 'ruhland', 'smol'] | ","['hargan', 'jeziorski', 'keller', 'nelligan', 'paterson', 'ruhland', 'smol']",0
326,"Transformation of alpine and subalpine vegetation in a potentially warmer future, the Anthropocene era. Tentative projections based on long-term observations and paleovegetation records | Predicted global warming as a consequence of rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases is anticipated to force reorganization of alpinoboreal ecosystems. On these premises, the objective of this paper is to make tentative projections of subalpine/alpine plant cover performance over the present century in the Scandes Mountains of Sweden. This effort draws on paleovegetation data; reversal of a consistent Holocene cooling trend, and monitoring of the concerned system over the past century with predominant climate warming. On all time-scales, upper elevational species limits respond idiosyncratically and without appreciable time-lag to climate warming. Ecological impacts are largely mediated by snowmelt timing. Treelines and upper limits of subalpine/alpine vascular plants are projected to rise by at least 500 m, given a midrange projection of 3 degrees C secular warming. Over large parts of the landscape, however, strong or even strengthened wind exposure retards, reduces or prohibits this expansion and particularly the establishment of trees and closed forest. Thus, the alpine character of the landscape largely remains, while the ground cover takes on a denser and more luxuriant appearance. Upward plant migration implies a significant rise of species richness at high elevations, which possibly enhances ecosystem stability. Nothing suggests that rare and strongly specialized alpine plant species will be regionally extirpated or totally extinct in this region. Geomorphic instability (wind, water) in treeless alpine areas counteracts closure of the ground cover. Reproduction and vigour may even become stimulated for this group of species. Species-specific plant responses tend to upset traditional biogeographic zonation schemes, based on diagnostic species. Plant communities dependent on late snow-lie, i.e. alpine snowbed vegetation, alpine mires, subalpine birch forest and montane spruce forest lose substantially in prominence. With future climate warming, Pinus sylvestris resumes the dominant role in forest-alpine tundra ecotone it had during the thermal optimum in the early Holocene. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],3
327,"Tree mortality following partial harvests is determined by skidding proximity | Recently developed structural retention harvesting strategies aim to improve habitat and ecological services provided by managed forest stands by better emulating natural disturbances. The potential for elevated mortality of residual trees following such harvests remains a critical concern for forest managers, and may present a barrier to more widespread implementation of the approach. We used a harvest chronosequence combined with dendrochronological techniques and an individual-based neighborhood analysis to examine the rate and time course of residual-tree mortality in the first decade following operational partial ""structural retention'' harvests in the boreal forest of Ontario, Canada. In the first year after harvest, residual-tree mortality peaked at 12.6 times the preharvest rate. Subsequently, mortality declined rapidly and approached preharvest levels within 10 years. Proximity to skid trails was the most important predictor both of windthrow and standing death, which contributed roughly equally to total postharvest mortality. Local exposure further increased windthrow risk, while crowding enhanced the risk of standing mortality. Ten years after harvest, an average of 10.5% of residual trees had died as a result of elevated postharvest mortality. Predicted cumulative elevated mortality in the first decade after harvest ranged from 2.4% to 37% of residual trees across the observed gradient of skid trail proximity, indicating that postharvest mortality will remain at or below acceptable rates only if skidding impacts are minimized. These results represent an important step toward understanding how elevated mortality may influence stand dynamics and habitat supply following moderate-severity disturbances such as partial harvests, insect outbreaks, and windstorms. | ['caspersen', 'thomas', 'thorpe'] | ","['caspersen', 'thomas', 'thorpe']",0
328,"The Tunguska catastrophe and its effect on the vegetation | A summary account of the findings of various expeditions on the Tunguska catastrophe, caused by the explosion of a cosmic body (identified by various authorities as a meteorite, a small comet, a piece of anti-matter, or a nuclear-powered space-ship) over the Siberian taiga on 30 June 1908. The pattern of forest destruction by blast and fire is described, and it has been established that the explosion occurred at an altitude of 5-7 km. The evidence of tree-ring studies is discussed: in some places (but not everywhere) the growth rate of surviving trees increased greatly after the catastrophe. In 1958, radioactivity of the peat and soil in the region was normal. Determination of the radioactivity in the wood of growing trees indicated that radioactivity had increased only after 1945 (i.e. the year of the explosion of the first atomic bomb).

We use the model as a tool to evaluate assumptions of charcoal dispersal and taphonomy and to assess the merits of inferring local and regional fire history by decomposing charcoal records into low-frequency ('background') and high-frequency ('peak') components. Under specific dispersal scenarios, the model generates records similar in appearance to sediment-charcoal records from Alaskan boreal forests. These scenarios require long-distance dispersal (e.g. 10(0)-10(1) km), consistent with observations from wildfires but longer than previously inferred from experimental dispersal data. More generally, charcoal accumulation in simulated records mainly reflects area burned within the charcoal source area. Variability in charcoal peak heights is primarily explained by the size of charcoal source areas relative to the size of simulated fires, with an increase in this ratio resulting in increased variability in peak heights. Mixing and multi-year sampling add noise to charcoal records, obscuring the relationship between area burned and charcoal accumulation. This noise highlights the need for statistical treatments of charcoal records. Using simulated records we demonstrate that long-term averages of charcoal accumulation (> 10 x mean fire return interval) correlate well with area burned within the entire charcoal source area. We further demonstrate how decomposing simulated records to isolate the peak component emphasizes fire occurrence at smaller spatial scales (< 1 km radius), despite the importance of long-distance charcoal dispersal in simulating charcoal records similar to observations. Together, these results provide theoretical support for the analysis of charcoal records using the decomposition approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

330,"Variability of plant species diversity in Swedish natural forest and its relation to atmospheric deposition | Within a subprogram of Integrated Monitoring (IM), understorey vegetation in Swedish natural forests was observed at fifteen reference sites over the country for twelve seasons, 1982-1993. The main task of the subprogram was to assess the impact of atmospheric deposition, mainly sulphur and nitrogen, on natural vegetation through time. The present study is focused on the variability of plant species diversity at community level and the possible impact of sulphur and nitrogen deposition. Species richness, evenness and diversity varied greatly among the sites, and between years within each site. Regarding only coniferous forests the species richness was higher in the north than in the south. But the effects of site condition and atmospheric deposition were not clarified. Changes in species diversity through time differed from site to site. No overall temporal trend was found. The atmospheric deposition of sulphur and nitrogen demonstrated a clear geographical pattern being low in the north-west and high in the south-west. Sulphur deposition declined significantly in Southern Sweden during the period. We concluded that the species diversity of understorey vegetation at the Swedish IM sites was not significantly influenced by atmospheric deposition. The changes observed are explained as natural processes. | ['brakenhielm', 'liu'] | ","['brakenhielm', 'liu']",3
331,"Variations in leaf area index in northern and eastern North America over the past 21,000 years: a data-model comparison | Over the past 10 years, there has been a growing debate about the relative importance of late-Quaternary variations in climate and CO2 as drivers of changes in vegetation structure. In this study, we compare new datasets of pollen-reconstructed leaf area index values (LAIs) for northern and eastern North America with BIOME4 simulations and regional vegetation histories in order to identify sources of data-model disagreements and assess the relative influence Of CO2 and climate on LAI. BIOME4, an equilibrium biogeochemistry-biogeography vegetation model, was forced by climate simulations from the Hadley Centre Unified GCM to simulate changes in LAI at 1000-year intervals for the past 21,000 years in six regions of North America. BIOME4 simulations included sensitivity experiments to investigate the effects Of CO2 and climate on LAI. Pollen-reconstructed LAIs were based on the modern analog technique and a cross-referencing of surface pollen samples against recent LAI observations from the MODIS sensor. Pollen-reconstructed LAIs were biased towards too high values due to lower-than-present atmospheric CO2; sensitivity experiments with BIOME4 suggested that this bias ranged from 13 +/- 7% during the Lateglacial period (21-12 ka) to 7 +/- 4% during the Holocene (11-0 ka).:Simulated and reconstructed LAI trends agreed well for western Canada, southeastern Canada/northern US, and eastern North America, but significant discrepancies were observed in the Midwestern LIS, Alaska, and southeastern US. Causes of data-model discrepancies varied by region and were due to (1) inaccurate simulation of the prairie-forest ecotone in the Midwestern US due to too-wet climate simulations; (2) a combination of too-high simulated LAIs for Lateglacial tundra and too-low reconstructed LAIs from Alaskan pollen samples that lacked modern analogs; and (3) too-high reconstructed LAIs for scrublands in the southeastern US. Sensitivity tests indicated that late-Quaternary changes in LAI were driven primarily by climate, with CO2 as a secondary influence. Sensitivity simulations in which climate was allowed to vary while CO2 was constant agreed better with reconstructed LAIs and regional vegetation histories than did the simulations in which CO2 varied and climate was constant. Our work emphasizes the need for models to incorporate the effects of both CO2 and climate on late-Quaternary vegetation dynamics and structure. We show that LAI is a viable paleo-vegetation proxy that can be used as a benchmark for rigorous, quantitative data-model comparisons focusing primarily on vegetation history, particularly in regions with high densities of fossil pollen data.

332,"Vegetation and lake changes on the southern Taymyr peninsula, northern Siberia, during the last 300 years inferred from pollen and Pediastrum green algae records | Siberian arctic vegetation and lake water communities, known for their temperature dependence, are expected to be particularly impacted by recent climate change and high warming rates. However, decadal information on the nature and strength of recent vegetation change and its time lag to climate signals are rare. In this study, we present a Pb-210/Cs-137 dated pollen and Pediastrum species record from a unnamed lake in the south of the Taymyr peninsula covering the period from AD 1706 to 2011. Thirty-nine palynomorphs and 10 morphotypes of Pediastrum species were studied to assess changes in vegetation and lake conditions as probable responses to climate change. We compared the pollen record with Pediastrum species, which we consider to be important proxies of climate changes. Three pollen assemblage zones characterised by Betula nana, Alnus viridis and Larix gmelinii (1706-1808); herbs such as Cyperaceae, Artemisia or Senecio (1808-1879), and higher abundance of Larix pollen (1955-2011) are visible. Also, three Pediastrum assemblage zones show changes of aquatic conditions: higher abundances of Pediastrum boryanum var. brevicorne (1706-1802); medium abundances of P. kawraiskyi and P. integrum (1802-1840 and 1920-1980), indicating cooler conditions while less eutrophic conditions are indicated by P. boryanum, and a mainly balanced composition with only small changes of cold- and warm-adapted Pediastrum species (1965-2011). In general, compositional Pediastrum species turnover is slightly higher than that indicated by pollen data (0.54 vs 0.34 SD), but both are only minor for this treeline location. In conclusion, the relevance of differentiation of Pediastrum species is promising and can give further insights into the relationship between lakes and their surrounding vegetation transferred onto climatic conditions. | ['herzschuh', 'niemeyer', 'pestryakova'] | ","['herzschuh', 'niemeyer', 'pestryakova']",4
333,"Vegetation transitions drive the autotrophy-heterotrophy balance in Arctic lakes | ""Arctic greening"" will alter vegetation quantity and quality in northern watersheds, with possible consequences for lake metabolic balance. We used paleolimnology from six Arctic lakes in Greenland, Norway, and Alaska to develop a conceptual model describing how climate-driven shifts in terrestrial vegetation (spanning herb to boreal forest) influence lake autotrophic biomass (as chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments). Major autotrophic transitions occurred, including (1) optimal production of siliceous algae and cyanobacteria/chlorophytes at intermediate vegetation cover (dwarf shrub and Betula; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) range of 2-4 mg L-1), below and above which UVR exposure (DOC;< 2 mgL(-1)) and light extinction (DOC;> 4 mgL(-1)), respectively limit algal biomass, (2) an increase in potentially mixotrophic cryptophytes with higher forest cover and allochthonous carbon supply. Vegetation cover appears to influence lake autotrophs by changing influx of (colored) dissolved organic matter which has multiple interacting roles-as a photoprotectant-in light attenuation and in macronutrient (carbon, nitrogen) supply. | ['anderson', 'edward', 'hopla', 'jones', 'langdon', 'law', 'mcgowan', 'soloveiva', 'turner', 'whiteford', 'wiik', 'van', 'hardenbroek'] | ","['anderson', 'edward', 'hopla', 'jones', 'langdon', 'law', 'mcgowan', 'soloveiva', 'turner', 'whiteford', 'wiik', 'van', 'hardenbroek']",0
334,"Holocene vegetational and limnological changes in the Fennoscandian tree-line area as documented by pollen and diatom records from Lake Tsuolbmajavri, Finland | A 291 cm sediment core was taken from Lake Tsuolbmajavri in the Finnish tree-line area. The core was dated by means of 14 AMS 14C-dates. Pollen data indicate that during the early-Holocene the catchment was characterized by birch forest. Gradual expansion of pine started at 9200 cal BP. Pine reached its maximum occurrence at 7200-6000 cal BP and pine tree-line retreated from the area at 4600 cal BP. During the late Holocene, the cooler and moister climate led to increasing peatland development in the catchment. The influence of vegetation dynamics on the limnology of the lake was investigated by means of diatom-stratigraphical data. The increasing total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, water color, and decreasing pH from 8500 cal BP to 6000 cal BP reflect the gradual development of forest and more humic soil. The disappearance of pine caused a slight rise in pH and a decrease of TOC and water color values. At 3000 cal BP, TOC concentrations and water color started to increase again. This change is synchronous with the rise of Sphagnum spore influx values and may reflect the impact of peatland expansion on lake water quality. The results suggest that the catchment vegetation patterns, mainly tree-line dynamics and peatland distribution, have influenced the limnological features of Lake Tsuolbmajavri. | ['seppa', 'weckstrom'] | ","['seppa', 'weckstrom']",3
335,"Water and carbon stable isotope records from natural archives: A new database and interactive online platform for data browsing, visualizing and downloading | Past climate is an important benchmark to assess the ability of climate models to simulate key processes and feedbacks. Numerous proxy records exist for stable isotopes of water and/or carbon, which are also implemented inside the components of a growing number of Earth system model. Model-data comparisons can help to constrain the uncertainties associated with transfer functions. This motivates the need of producing a comprehensive compilation of different proxy sources. We have put together a global database of proxy records of oxygen (Œ¥18O), hydrogen (Œ¥D) and carbon (Œ¥13C) stable isotopes from different archives: ocean and lake sediments, corals, ice cores, speleothems and tree-ring cellulose. Source records were obtained from the georeferenced open access PANGAEA and NOAA libraries, complemented by additional data obtained from a literature survey. About 3000 source records were screened for chronological information and temporal resolution of proxy records. Altogether, this database consists of hundreds of dated Œ¥18O, Œ¥13C and Œ¥D records in a standardized simple text format, complemented with a metadata Excel catalog. A quality control flag was implemented to describe age markers and inform on chronological uncertainty. This compilation effort highlights the need to homogenize and structure the format of datasets and chronological information as well as enhance the distribution of published datasets that are currently highly fragmented and scattered. We also provide an online portal based on the records included in this database with an intuitive and interactive platform (&lt;a hrefCombining double low line""http://climateproxiesfinder.ipsl.fr/"" targetCombining double low line""-blank""&gt;http://climateproxiesfinder.ipsl.fr/&lt;/a&gt;), allowing one to easily select, visualize and download subsets of the homogeneously formatted records that constitute this database, following a choice of search criteria, and to upload new datasets. In the last part, we illustrate the type of application allowed by our database by comparing several key periods highly investigated by the paleoclimate community. For coherency with the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), we focus on records spanning the past 200 years, the mid-Holocene (MH, 5.5&amp;ndash;6.5ƒù‚Ç¨ka; calendar kiloyears before 1950), the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19&amp;ndash;23ƒù‚Ç¨ka), and those spanning the last interglacial period (LIG, 115&amp;ndash;130ƒù‚Ç¨ka). Basic statistics have been applied to characterize anomalies between these different periods. Most changes from the MH to present day and from LIG to MH appear statistically insignificant. Significant global differences are reported from LGM to MH with regional discrepancies in signals from different archives and complex patterns. ¬© Author(s) 2016. | ['bassinot', 'bolliet', 'brockmann', 'daux', 'genty', 'landais', 'lavrieux', 'masson', 'delmotte', 'michel', 'ortega', 'risi', 'roche', 'didier', 'vimeux', 'waelbroeck'] | ","['bassinot', 'bolliet', 'brockmann', 'daux', 'genty', 'landais', 'lavrieux', 'masson', 'delmotte', 'michel', 'ortega', 'risi', 'roche', 'didier', 'vimeux', 'waelbroeck']",0
336,"Weather-mediated decline in prey delivery rates causes food-limitation in a top avian predator | Inclement weather can negatively affect breeding birds directly by exposure to factors such as severe temperature and rainfall, or indirectly by reducing food supply. During a three-year study of Arctic peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus tundrius breeding in Nunavut, Canada, we estimated annual prey density at a biologically relevant scale (i.e. the home range of breeding pairs), and examined the manner in which prey density and within-season weather conditions influenced occupancy of breeding sites, egg-laying, hatch rate, prey delivery rates and growth and survivability of nestlings. The first two summers of our study (2010-2011) were warm and dry, while the third summer (2012) was cool and wet, and was preceded by a severe spring rain event. We found that occupancy of breeding sites was consistently high. As a proportion of the number of eggs laid, hatch rate did not change among years, but the number of eggs laid per occupied site declined in the third year of the study. In the first two years of the study, the number of nestlings per occupied sited was high, but declined in the third year. Total prey density at the home range scale was similar in 2010 and 2012, while the highest prey density was recorded in 2011. Total prey delivery rates to nestlings and nestling growth rates were significantly lower in 2012, which received more precipitation than 2010 and 2011. Nestling growth rates were similar in 2010 and 2011, but were markedly different in 2012; for both sexes the period of rapid growth was of shorter duration in 2012 and asymptotic weights were lower. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence that indicates severe rain events and ongoing periods of wet weather can reduce reproductive output of Arctic-breeding raptors regardless of whether it occurs during laying, incubation or brood rearing. | ['derocher', 'franke', 'robinson'] | ","['derocher', 'franke', 'robinson']",4
337,"Wolf Predation of Caribou the Nelchina Herd Case History a Different Interpretation | The Nelchina caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in southcentral Alaska [USA] erupted from 1953 to 1961, declined from 1961 through 1972, and increased again after 1976. Calf recruitment was low prior to gray wold (Canis lupus) control in 1949-51. After wolves were reduced recruitment improved from 1952 to 1956. Recruitment of 2.5-year-old caribou from 1952 to 1967 was correlated with wolf numbers (r = -0.693, n = 16 [excluding 1967, r = -0.871]) but not with winter snow depths (r = -0.373, n = 16). However, in 1964, 1965, and 1966 heavy snow cover may have prevented females from reaching the calving grounds and cows calved at lower elevations nearer to predators. In these 3 years, recruitment was low and the loss of these 3 cohorts was a major factor in the decline from 1961 to 1972. There was no evidence of winter starvation in any year. After 1976, the wolf population was again reduced, caribou recruitment improved, and the herd increased. We conclude that predation of young animals was the most consistent natural limiting factor in the dynamics of this herd from 1950 to 1984. | ['ballard', 'bergerud'] | ","['ballard', 'bergerud']",0
338,"Woody vegetation, fuel and fire track the melting of the Scandinavian ice-sheet before 9500 cal yr BP | New studies indicate the presence of early Holocene ice-free areas far north in Scandinavia. Post-glacial fire and vegetation were investigated based on sedimentary charcoal and pollen from two small lakes in northern Sweden. Accumulation of organic sediment started around 10,900 and 9200 cal yr BP, showing that both lake valleys were ice-free extremely early given their northerly location. Fire events started after 9600 cal yr BP and became less common around the '8.2-ka event'. Woody vegetation provided fuel that contributed to fires. The first vegetation in our pollen record consisted of Hippophae, Dryas, grasses and sedges. Subsequently broadleaved trees (Betula, Salix) increased in abundance and later Pinus, Alnus, ferns and Lyco podium characterized the vegetation. Pollen from Larix, Picea and Malus were also found. The change in vegetation composition was synchronous with the decrease in lake-water pH in the region, indicating ecosystem-scale processes; this occurred during a period of net global and regional warming. The changes in fire frequency and vegetation appear independent of regional trends in precipitation. The reconstructed fire history and vegetation support the scenario of early ice-free areas far north in Scandinavia during early Holocene warming, creating favorable conditions for woody plants and wildfires.

It reviews the most important factors that define the zoogeography and diversity of freshwater invertebrates in the Arctic and Antarctic, and provides detail on the ecology and life-history of some key zooplankton and aquatic insects.

However, 17 AMS 14C measurements performed on terrestrial plant macrofossils contained in these sediments show that deposition began during the late Allerod, when the ice margin had already receded to the northern part of Lake Onega. Based on an age model, we assume that the 1933-year-long varved sequence covers the time period between c. 12 900 and 11 000 calendar years BP. During this period, which comprises the later part of the Late Weichselian and the early Holocene, the local vegetation consisted of open, tree-less dwarf shrub heaths.

Diatoms were found only in the upper 2.5 cm of the sedimentary record, and where present, diatom assemblages were composed almost entirely of Staurosirella pinnata. Photosynthetic pigments were present in low concentrations throughout the sedimentary profile, consistent with the ultra-oligotrophic nutrient status of the lake. Pigment concentrations varied slightly in the lower sections of the core, and began to increase gradually at the 4 cm horizon followed by an increase of two orders of magnitude in the uppermost 2.5 cm. The changes observed in the sedimentary record of Ward Hunt Lake had similar trajectories to those observed post-1850 elsewhere in the circumpolar Arctic, and imply that aquatic communities even in the most extreme northern lakes have been strongly impacted by recent climate warming. | ['andersen', 'antoniades', 'crawley', 'doran', 'douglas', 'hawes', 'pienitz', 'pollard', 'vincent'] | ","['andersen', 'antoniades', 'crawley', 'doran', 'douglas', 'hawes', 'pienitz', 'pollard', 'vincent']",2

In addition, sequenced control reactions were used to produce a contaminant library that was used to filter similar sequences from sample libraries.

Taxonomic community distances were similar for each marker across the two soil cores when the chi-squared metric was used; however, the 12S and cox1 markers did not cluster well when the Goodall similarity metric was used.

Models of fetal bone turnover combined with seasonally-sensitive taxa show that the carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of USR infant bone collagen reflects maternal diets over the summer. Using comparative faunal isotope data, we demonstrate that although terrestrial sources dominated maternal diets, salmon was also important, supported by carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids and bone bioapatite. Tooth enamel samples indicate increased salmon use between spring and summer.

10,"Another perspective on the age and origin of the Berelyokh mammoth site (northeast Siberia) | The Berelyokh site includes an exceptional bone horizon consisting of 8431 remains of Mammuthus primigenius. Previous investigations, spanning similar to 40 years, concluded that the deaths and bone concentration were caused by spring flooding, possibly related to wetter Bolling climates. We review work from these studies with emphasis on under-reported palynological data to provide more detail on paleoenvironmental reconstructions and an alternative interpretation for the age and origin of the bone bed. Palynological results suggest the horizon formed under cool conditions of the last glacial maximum, rather than during a Bolling-type oscillation. Presence of permafrost features and associated tundra pollen taxa in the Berelyokh sections suggest that thermokarst processes, unrelated to climate change, could account for the formation of the bone horizon. The penetration of surface waters into frozen sediments of a high floodplain terrace resulted in the formation of hidden thaw sinks. As thaw continued, the pits expanded with surface soils supported by a viscous water-sediment mixture. The weakened surface gave way under the weight of the mammoths, with the hillside collapsing either due to the animals' struggles or destabilization related to the thaw sinks. This scenario highlights the hazards of thermokarst terrain for present and future populations of northern animals. | ['anderson', 'lozhkin'] | ","['anderson', 'lozhkin']",4

The article presents results of the first study of soil charcoal stratigraphy, taxonomy, and radiocarbon dating combined with morphological analysis of soil profiles performed for sandy soil (Podzols and Arenosols) in the Meshchera Lowlands. Charcoal samples from different soil patterns and horizons were taken from 19 soil pits in four forest sites. The taxonomic identification of charcoals was performed for 24 soil samples; 12 charcoal samples were radiocarbon-dated. The following three patterns of ancient pedoturbations were studied in the soil profiles: arable layers, root channels, and pits formed after treefalls with uprooting. Results of soil charcoal analysis were compared with pollen and microscopic charcoal analysis of the cores taken in the surrounding peats. Pinus charcoals of various age prevailed in all charcoal samples. Charcoal of Betula and Sorbus also occurred. The oldest charcoal fragments were 2610 cal. BP. The remaining charcoal samples were mainly grouped into three clusters: about 2200, about 900-1000, and later 500 cal. BP. We assume that most charcoal samples were associated with burning and subsequent plowing which provided the upper layer of the soil (arable layers and sometimes root channels) with charcoal fragments. Charcoals were most abundant in the deepest pits formed after ancient treefalls. Periods of accumulation of charcoals in the peatlands and in the soil did not coincide for the last several millennia in the study region: intensive mixing of charcoals into the soil began after a decrease in the flow of charcoals into the peats. We associate this with the changing dynamics of landscapes under the influence of anthropogenic factors. | ['bobrovsky', 'khanina', 'kupriaynov'] | ","['bobrovsky', 'khanina', 'kupriaynov']",2

It has allowed us to recognize different rhythms of sharp changes of the pollen and spore contents of regional components of pollen spectra, corresponding to rhythms of syngenetic permafrost sediments and to correlate these rhythms with fluctuations established in sea deposits and ice cores, with a 5-10 thousand years cycle called the Heinrich events.

14,"Application of 34 S analysis for elucidating terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems: Evidence of animal movement/husbandry practices in an early Viking community around Lake Myvatn, Iceland | Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) have been used widely in archaeology to investigate palaeodiet. Sulphur stable isotope ratios (delta S-34) have shown great promise in this regard but the potential of this technique within archaeological science has yet to be fully explored. Here we report delta S-34, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for 129 samples of animal bone collagen from Skutustadir, an early Viking age (landnam) settlement in north-east Iceland. This dataset represents the most comprehensive study to date of its kind on archaeological material and the results show a clear offset in delta S-34 values between animals deriving their dietary resources from terrestrial (mean = + 5.6 +/- 2.8 parts per thousand), freshwater (mean = + 2.7 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand) or marine (mean = + 15.9 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand) reservoirs (with the three food groups being significantly different at 2 sigma). This offset allows reconstruction of the dietary history of domesticated herbivores and demonstrates differences in husbandry practices and animal movement/trade, which would be otherwise impossible using only delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. For example, several terrestrial herbivores displayed enriched bone collagen delta S-34 values compared to the geology of the Lake Myvatn region, indicating they may have been affected by sea-spray whilst being pastured closer to the coast, before being traded inland. Additionally, the combination of heavy delta N-15 values coupled with light delta S-34 values within pig bone collagen suggests that these omnivores were consuming freshwater fish as a significant portion of their diet. Arctic foxes were also found to be consuming large quantities of freshwater resources and radiocarbon dating of both the pigs and foxes confirmed previous studies showing that a large freshwater radiocarbon (C-14) reservoir effect exists within the lake. Overall, these stable isotope and C-14 data have important implications for obtaining a fuller reconstruction of the diets of the early Viking settlers in Iceland, and may allow a clearer identification of the marine and/or freshwater C-14 reservoir effects that are known to exist in human bone collagen.

15,"Applications of freshwater diatoms to geographical research | Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are a widely distributed group of microscopic, unicellular algae that are characterized by siliceous cell walls (frustules). The size, shape and sculpturing of diatom frustules are taxonomically diagnostic. Moreover, because of their siliceous composition, diatoms are often well preserved in stratigraphic deposits, where they can be used to infer (quantitatively or qualitatively) past environmental conditions. The sensitivity of diatoms to a wide variety of environmental variables provides geographers with a multitude of research opportunities. This review focuses on palaeoecological reconstructions that are based on freshwater diatoms.

16,"Assessing the efficacy of chironomid and diatom assemblages in tracking eutrophication in High Arctic sewage ponds | Eutrophication is the most common water quality issue affecting freshwaters worldwide. Paleolimnological approaches have been used in temperate regions to track eutrophication over time, placing changes in historical context. Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) have a direct physiological response to changes in nutrients and are effective indicators of lake trophic status. Chironomids (Diptera) have also been used to track nutrient conditions; however, given that nutrients and oxygen are often tightly linked, it is difficult to disentangle which variable is driving shifts in assemblages. Here, we analyze chironomid and diatom remains in sediments from sewage-impacted ponds in the High Arctic. These ponds have the unusual characteristics of elevated nutrient and oxygen concentrations, unlike those of typical eutrophic lakes where deepwater oxygen is often depleted. Our data show that while diatom assemblages responded to changing nutrients, no concomitant changes in chironomid assemblage composition were recorded. Furthermore, the dominance of oligotrophic, cold stenothermic chironomid taxa, and lack of so-called ""eutrophic"" species in the eutrophic sewage ponds suggests that oxygen, not nutrients, structures chironomid assemblages at these sites. | ['douglas', 'mciver', 'michelutti', 'smol', 'stewart'] | ","['douglas', 'mciver', 'michelutti', 'smol', 'stewart']",0
17,"Assessing source areas of pollutants from studies of fly ash, charcoal, and pollen from Svalbard snow and ice | [1] Temporal variations in the quantities of pollen, charcoal, and SCP ( spheroidal carbonaceous particles) contained in the Lomonosovfonna ice core from Svalbard and in the surface snow of the ice cap are presented. The abundance of these microparticles is illustrated for the period A. D. 1850 - 1997 from the ice core, together with detailed snow pit stratigraphies for summer 2001 to spring 2002. Viewing SCP and pollen together is a new approach with relevance for tracing the possible origin of contaminants. The SCP are related to the pollution source while the pollen gives an indication of the vegetation at the point of origin. The deposition of SCP on the ice is also compared with deposition of SCP in northern Fennoscandia for the period A. D. 1982 - 1997. The quantity of pollen and the pollen types recorded suggest an origin in Fennoscandia rather than in North America. The temporal pattern of both SCP and charcoal deposition reflects that of Europe but may also contains a local signal. | ['hick', 'isaksson'] | ","['hick', 'isaksson']",0
18,"Assessment of freshwater diatoms as quantitative indicators of past climatic change in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada | We identified, enumerated, and interpreted the diatom assemblages preserved in the surface sediments of 59 lakes located between Whitehorse in the Yukon and Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories (Canada). The lakes are distributed along a latitudinal gradient that includes several ecoclimatic zones. It also spans large gradients in limnological variables. Thus, the study lakes are ideal for environmental calibration of modern diatom assemblages. Canonical correspondence analysis, with forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests, showed that maximum lake depth and summer surface-water temperature were the two environmental variables that accounted for most of the variance in the diatom data. The concentrations of sodium and calcium were also important explanatory variables. Using weighted-averaging regression and calibration techniques, we developed a predictive statistical model to infer lake surface-water temperature, and we evaluated the feasibility of using diatoms as paleoclimate proxies. This model may be used to derive paleotemperature inferences from fossil diatom assemblages at appropriate sites in the western Canadian Arctic. | ['birks', 'pienitz', 'smol'] | ","['birks', 'pienitz', 'smol']",4
19,"Assessment for paleoclimatic utility of terrestrial biomarker records in the Okhotsk Sea sediments | We measured terrestrial plant biomarker (long-chain n-alkanes) in the sediment cores taken from the Sea of Okhotsk to examine paleoclimatic utility of long-chain n-alkanes in marine sediments. This study demonstrates that sedimentary record of n-alkane in the sea has a high potential to provide important complementary paleo-climate/paleo-environmental information. Molecular distributions of long-chain n-alkanes in marine sediments show a typical signature of terrestrial plant wax derived n-alkanes with strong odd carbon number predominance from the last glacial to the present, suggesting a source of long-chain n-alkanes in the Okhotsk Sea sediments has been terrestrial higher plants throughout the time. The down core profiles of concentrations of C25-C35 n-alkanes in XP07-C9 collected from the northwestern site revealed three events of enhanced terrestrial organic matter input during the last deglaciation. The two pronounced events correspond to Melt Water Pulse (MWP) events 1A (14.5-12.5 ka) and 1B (11-6.5 ka). These events possibly linked to increases in river discharge and erosion of submerged continental shelf due to drastic rise in sea level. Down core profiles of molecular distributions of n-alkanes in the Okhotsk Sea sediments significantly vary over the last 25 kyr, and are similar to that of a peat core sequence in the East Russia and essentially consistent with pollen data from marine and peat core sequences.

20,"Associations of Chironomidae Diptera of Shallow Acid Humic Lakes and Bog Pools in Atlantic Canada and a Comparison with an Earlier Paleoecological Investigation | The composition of benthos in a series of 29 lake and peat pool sites is examined especially in relation to a successional gradient. The results indicate a sharp distinction between the fauna of peat pools and lakes. Chironomus, Psectrocladius, Monopsectrocladius and Zalutschia are characteristic of bog lakes at the latter stages of their evolution and peat pools. Procladius and Tanytarsus dominate in most lakes. Between weakly acidic and strongly acidic lakes a sharp boundary exists for many other components of the benthos. Chaoborus occurs in strongly acidic lakes. Amphipoda and Ephemeroptera are limited to weakly acidic or circum-neutral waters.

21,"Basin-specific records of lake oligotrophication during the middle-to-late Holocene in boreal northeast Ontario, Canada | Descriptions of regional climate expression require data from multiple lakes, yet little is known of how variation in records within morphometrically complex lakes may affect interpretations. In northeast Ontario (Canada), this issue was addressed using records of pollen, pigments, and diatoms in three sediment cores from two small boreal lakes spanning the last similar to 6000 years. Pollen analysis suggested warm conditions between similar to 6000 and similar to 4000 cal yr BP, coherent with previous assessments from boreal eastern Ontario and western Quebec. Analysis of phototrophic communities from fossil pigments and diatom valves suggested relatively eutrophic conditions with lower lake-levels during this interval. Generalized additive model trends identified significant regional changes in pollen assemblages and declines in pigment concentrations after similar to 4000 cal yr BP consistent with cooler and wetter climate conditions that resulted in regional lake oligotrophication and increased lake levels during the late-Holocene. Despite contemporaneous changes in pollen and pigment biomarkers across lakes, cores collected from adjacent basins of the same lake (Green Lake) did not show similar trends in fossil pigments likely reflecting preferential deposition of clay-rich allochthonous material in the deeper central basin and suggesting that regional signals in climate may be complicated by lake- or basin-specific catchment processes. | ['cumming', 'gushulak', 'leavitt'] | ","['cumming', 'gushulak', 'leavitt']",2

23,"Biomonitoring past salinity changes in an athalassic subarctic lake | A short sediment core was taken from a small saline lake located on an intermontane plateau in the central Yukon Territory, Canada. In July 1990, chemical analyses indicated that, although the lake was shallow (Zmax=1.1 m), it was also chemically stratified, with hyposaline (9.9 to 10.0 g L-1) surface waters and slightly mesosaline (22.0 g L-1) deeper waters. The surface water was dominated by Na+ and HCO3- . To our knowledge, this is the northernmost athalassic saline lake yet recorded. Quantification of algal (diatom, chrysophyte, and pigment) and invertebrate (chironomid, ceratopogonid, and Chaoborus) fossils at four stratigraphic levels indicated that the lake sediments preserved numerous biological indicators that could be used to infer recent lake development. Many of the taxa are found in other athalassic salt lakes. The most striking stratigraphic change was a remarkable drop in the species richness of diatoms and invertebrates in the recent sediments, which parallels the elimination of species characteristic of less saline conditions. Halophilous taxa dominate the most recent sediments, indicating the development of more saline conditions. At the same time, a significant shift in chrysophyte cyst composition was observed. Fossil carotenoids and chlorophylls indicated a decrease in total algal abundance in recent sediments, as green and blue-green algae replaced diatoms and chrysophytes. Together, these paleolimnological data suggest a recent shift to drier conditions or increased evaporation in the central Yukon Territory. ¬© 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers. | ['leavitt', 'pienitz', 'smol', 'walker', 'zeeb'] | ","['leavitt', 'pienitz', 'smol', 'walker', 'zeeb']",2
24,"Bog development and landform dynamics in central Sweden and south-eastern Labrador, Canada | Stratigraphic analysis, detailed surveying, and radiocarbon dating were used to document the development of Hammarmossen, a raised mire in central Sweden, and to compare it with Gilbert bog in south-eastern Labrador, Canada. A series of basal radiocarbon dates from transects of peat cores across Hammarmossen shows that peat started to accumulate approximately 5500 years B.P. and spread radially across a glacial outwash plain throughout the late Holocene. The implications of this pattern of development for models of bog hydrology and growth are discussed. On both Swedish and Labrador mires the distribution, shape and development of open-water pools are closely controlled by the topography of the peat surface. Pools were initiated throughout the last 4000 years of bog development. On Hammarmossen a deep layer of algal gyttja partly fills the pools, whereas on Labrador bogs the pool floors are degrading peat and peat detritus. Once formed, pools undergo similar dynamics in the two regions. | ['foster', 'king', 'thelaus', 'wright', 'jr'] | ","['foster', 'king', 'thelaus', 'wright', 'jr']",4

26,"The Bottom of Lake Myvatn Iceland Past Present and Future | The present lake came into being about 2300 years ago when the precursor lake was overrun by a lavaflow from the Threngslaborgir/Ludentsborgir crater row. Sediment from the precursor lake can be found underlying the sediment formed in the present lake, as well as mixed with scoria in pseudocraters to the south of Lake Myvatn. Palaeolimnological investigations have shown that the green alga Cladophora aegagropila increased considerably in the early 17th century. The most probable cause is a gradual decrease in water depth due to sedimentation. C. aegagrophila is a dominant macrophyte on the botton of the Syorifloi basin and serves as a substrate for invertebrates, i.a. Eurycercus lamellatus, which is important as food for diving ducks (Anatidae) and arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). Certain bottom areas are clearly very important for wildlife conservation. These include (1) spawning sites of arctic charr and trout (Salmo trutta); (2) areas that are icefree in winter and hence important to the Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica); (3) major brood-rearing areas; (4) areas where large flocks of ducks occur regularly; (5) focal areas of common scoter (Melanitta nigra), (6) moulting sites of whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) and (7) gadwall (Anas strepera).

27,"Carbon accumulation in peatlands of West Siberia over the last 2000 years | We use a network of cores from 77 peatland sites to determine controls on peat C content and peat C accumulation over the last 2000 years (since 2 ka) across Russia's West Siberian Lowland (WSL), the world's largest wetland region. Our results show a significant influence of fossil plant composition on peat C content, with peats dominated by Sphagnum having a lower C content. Radiocarbon-derived C accumulation since 2 ka at 23 sites is highly variable from site to site, but displays a significant N-S trend of decreasing accumulation at higher latitudes. Northern WSL peatlands show relatively small C accumulation of 7 to 35 kg C m<sup>-2</sup> since 2 ka. In contrast, peatlands south of 60 degrees N show larger accumulation of 42 to 88 kg C m<sup>-2</sup>. Carbon accumulation since 2 ka varies significantly with modern mean annual air temperature, with maximum C accumulation found between -1 and 0 degrees C. Rates of apparent C accumulation since 2 ka show no significant relationship to long-term Holocene averages based on total C accumulation. A GIS-based extrapolation of our site data suggests that a substantial amount (~40%) of total WSL peat C has accumulated since 2 ka, with much of this accumulation south of 60 degrees N. The large peatlands in the southern WSL may be an important component of the Eurasian terrestrial C sink, and future warming could result in a shift northward in long-term WSL C sequestration. | ['beilman', 'macdonald', 'reimer', 'smith'] | ","['beilman', 'macdonald', 'reimer', 'smith']",4
28,"A centennial record of fluvial organic matter input from the discontinuous permafrost catchment of Lake Tornetrask | High-latitude regions are underlain by the most organic carbon (OC)-rich soils on earth and currently subject to intense climate warming, potentially increasing remobilization and mineralization of soil OC. Sub-Arctic Scandinavia is located on the 0 degrees C mean annual isotherm and is therefore particularly vulnerable to climate change. This study aimed to establish a baseline for soil OC release over the past century into Lake Tornetrask, the largest lake in sub-Arctic Scandinavia, through bulk geochemical and molecular radiocarbon analyses in chronologically constrained sediment cores. Our results suggest a dominance of peat-derived terrestrial OC inflow. We show that the annual terrestrial OC inflow to the lake is similar to 12 times higher than the in-lake produced particulate OC, and consists for a large part (ca. 60%) of old OC from deep reservoirs in the catchment. The sedimentary record shows signs of increasing inflow of more degraded terrestrial matter since similar to 1975, as indicated by increasing % TOC concentrations, a lower delta C-13 value and lower TOC: TN ratios. Based on simultaneous changes in local climate and reported signs of permafrost degradation (e.g., active layer deepening, mire/peat erosion), the observed changes in the sedimentary record of Scandinavia's largest mountain lake likely reflect a climate warming-induced change in terrestrial OC inflow. | ['alling', 'gustafsson', 'humborg', 'morth', 'rahm', 'vonk'] | ","['alling', 'gustafsson', 'humborg', 'morth', 'rahm', 'vonk']",4
29,"Chironomid fauna of the lakes from the Pechora river basin (east of European part of Russian Arctic): Ecology and reconstruction of recent ecological changes in the region | We investigated chironomid fauna of surface sediments and a short sediment core (Bol'shoy Kharbey Lake) from Pechora river basin, Northern Russia. Twenty three investigated lakes have thermokarst, glacial or floodplain origin and are characterised by low mineralization, mostly hydrocarbon-calcium type of water and low concentration of nutrients. Most of the lakes have circumneutral pH around <= 7 and only two lakes are slightly more acidic with pH <= 6. Ninety six chironomid taxa were identified in the surface sediments. Distribution of chironomids in the studied region is driven by continentality, mean T-July and NEuroDe. Chironomid communities from the core of the B. Kharbei Lake demonstrate the highest similarity with the fauna of the deeper lakes of the glacial origin. The glacial lakes have the highest indices of continentality and the lowest winter temperatures within the investigated data set. The chironomid fauna of the glacial lakes is composed of the profundal, oligotrophic and cold-stenotherm taxa. The fauna of the floodplain and thermokarst lakes is more closely related to T-July and is composed of littoral and phytophilic taxa of meso-or eutrophic waters and moderate temperature conditions. The fauna of the acidic thermokarst lakes considerably differs from the other lakes. Chironomid communities here are represented by tolerant to acidification taxa, and by the typically littoral and shallow water acid-tolerant taxa that apparently also can tolerate acidification. Studied sediment record covers ca last 200 years. The reconstructed T-July during the entire period remain slightly below the modern temperatures. From 1970 reconstructed T-July shows steady increase to the modern level. The reconstructed water depths (WDs) of the lake are higher than today till 1980. The highest WDs are reconstructed for ca 1970. After that the WDs gradually decrease to the modern level. Changes of the WDs are most probably related to changes in the precipitation rate. | ['brook', 'dauvalter', 'nazarova', 'self', 'solovieva', 'syrykh'] | ","['brook', 'dauvalter', 'nazarova', 'self', 'solovieva', 'syrykh']",2

In Sawtooth Lake on the Fosheim Peninsula, concentrations of chrysophycean stomatocysts increase dramatically in sediments deposited since AD 1920. Only trace abundances of stomatocysts are encountered in older sediments. In Kekerturnak Lake, on the north coast of Cumberland Peninsula, scales of Mallomonas spp., previously absent from the sediment record, appear suddenly in the upper 5.5 cm of sediment and subsequently become ubiquitous in the top 1.0 cm. These results corroborate diatom stratigraphic data from other sites in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, together suggesting that unprecedented ecological changes are presently occurring across this vast region. In all likelihood, these abrupt algal community shifts reflect the response of arctic lake ecosystems to well-documented climate warming since the Little Ice Age, with the implications that recent rates of environmental change are unprecedented in the context of the Holocene. | ['perren', 'wolfe'] | ","['perren', 'wolfe']",2

34,"Holocene climate change and carbon cycling in a groundwater-fed, boreal forest lake: Dune Lake, Alaska | Opal, organic C and N contents, and organic delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes were analyzed on a sedimentary sequence spanning the past similar to 12,000 years from Dune Lake, a shallow groundwater-fed lake in the boreal forest region of central interior Alaska. The chronology, based on Pb-210 and 15 AMS radiocarbon dates on terrestrial materials, indicates that 5 m of biogenic sediment accumulated following dune stabilization at similar to 10,000 cal yr BP. Previous studies on lake level and pollen were synthesized with these data to assess Holocene changes in hydrogeology and climate. Variability in groundwater level and flux has a strong control on lake level and are negatively correlated with the delta C-13 of organic matter produced within the lake. This relationship results from the input of groundwater with high pCO(2) and with dissolved inorganic carbon depleted in C-13, which subsequently affects lake phytoplankton delta C-13 signatures. A rapid rise in lake level between ca. 11,000 and 9,500 cal yr BP coincided with stabilization of the dune field adjacent to the lake and expansion of vegetation around the lake, including white spruce. Organic delta C-13 values are relatively low and constant between about 10,000 and 6,000 cal yr BP, and then steadily increase until about 2,000 cal yr BP, suggesting a pattern of high followed by dropping lake levels generally consistent with results from core-transect studies. Higher-frequency fluctuations of 2-3 aEuro degrees in delta C-13 are common, and suggest variability in aspects of the lake-carbon cycle over multi-decadal timescales. Recent trends in groundwater and lake level, river discharge, and precipitation suggest an important role for wintertime precipitation in the regional groundwater system. The unusual hydrology of this system relative to most other lakes studied for paleoclimate in this region provides a novel insight into different seasonal aspects of Alaskan paleoclimatology. The record is consistent with a general long-term decrease in wintertime precipitation, possibly accompanied by an increase in permafrost extent, over the Holocene. | ['barber', 'bigelow', 'edward', 'finney'] | ","['barber', 'bigelow', 'edward', 'finney']",4
35,"Holocene climate and development of a subarctic peatland near inuvik, northwest territories, Canada | Multi-proxy paleoecological analyses were carried out on cores from a peatland in the continuous permafrost zone, to determine the effect of past climatic change on peatland development. Stratigraphy, bulk density and organic matter content were analyzed for eight cores from Campbell Creek peatland (69degree17.3'N, 133degree15'W). Detailed pollen and macrofossil analyses were carried out on two cores, and stable isotope analysis on one of those cores. The results indicate a succession, starting at 9000-9500 BP, from an open water mineral wetland with aquatic plants, to a fen dominated by Drepanocladus mosses and sedges, and then a change to a Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic vegetation typical of most of the peatland today. The beginning of the latter transition appears to coincide with the end of the early Holocene warm period. The physical stratigraphies of the other six cores indicate that a similar successional sequence occurred across the peatland, with some local variation. The transition to ombrotrophic conditions may be associated with the aggradation of permafrost in the peatland, in response to regional cooling. The effect of climate cooling on the peatland was probably indirect, through the aggradation of permafrost and associated hydrological changes. | ['aravena', 'vardy', 'warner'] | ","['aravena', 'vardy', 'warner']",0
36,"Climate change and human settlement as drivers of late-Holocene vegetational change in the Faroe Islands | Changes in Faroese land surfaces during the late Holocene reflect intimate interactions between cultural and environmental development. Analyses of fossil wood, pollen and plant macrofossils indicate that the present open landscape replaced shrubby vegetation that was present from c. 6000 BC Up to c. AD 660. Conditions altered during the late Holocene, with loss of woody vegetation and increasing erosion: trends that were initiated prior to human settlement. AMS dating of sub-fossil Betula, Salix and Juniperus found buried in peat profiles from the islands of Suouroy, Sandoy, Eysturoy, Vagar and Streymoy, revealed that the islands had at least partial woody vegetation cover up to the time of continuous settlement. The settlement horizon, identified in a lacustrine sequence on the island of Eysturoy, dated to c. AD 570. It comprised pollen evidence for the cultivation of Hordeum, cultural macrofossil assemblages, charcoal fragments, diatom assemblage changes indicating lake nutrient enrichment and physical measurements showing increased sedimentation rates. The pollen record showed that heathland development was initiated prior to anthropogenic impact. The ecosystem impacts of settlement were therefore superimposed on landscape changes that began around AD 250. The earlier changes were most likely forced by increased storminess and declining atmospheric temperatures. | ['bradshaw', 'bradshaw', 'hannon', 'snowball', 'wastegard'] | ","['bradshaw', 'bradshaw', 'hannon', 'snowball', 'wastegard']",2

38,"A combined biogeochemical and palaeobotanical approach to study permafrost environments and past dynamics | When investigating past peatland processes and related carbon cycle dynamics, it is essential to identify and separate different peat environments: bogs, fens and permafrost, and their historical plant assemblages. Bog peat layers contain relatively well-preserved plant material for palaeoecological examination, whereas fen and permafrost peats are often highly humified, which in turn constrains reconstructions of past plant assemblages. Here, we analysed the chemical composition of arctic peat plateau plants to create a local reference training-set of plant biomarkers. We then combined palaeobotanical, biogeochemical and chronological analyses to one permafrost peat sequence collected from the East European Russian tundra (67 degrees 03'N, 62 degrees 57'E) to investigate past peatland dynamics and to evaluate the performance of the biomarker method in a highly decomposed permafrost environment. The results show that the chronologically constrained macrofossil analysis provided most of the essential information about the peatland succession. However, a more robust reconstruction of the past peatland dynamics was achieved by combining palaeobotanical and biogeochemical data sets. The similarity of the lipid biomarker distributions of the arctic and boreal peatland plants also implies that any established modern biomarker training-set of peatland plants could be applied universally to palaeoecological studies on peat sediments. | ['biasi', 'fontana', 'mcclymont', 'ronkainen', 'salonen', 'tuittila', 'valiranta'] | ","['biasi', 'fontana', 'mcclymont', 'ronkainen', 'salonen', 'tuittila', 'valiranta']",2
39,"Combined dynamics of mercury and terrigenous organic matter following impoundment of Churchill Falls Hydroelectric Reservoir, Labrador | Sediments from two recently (40 years) flooded lakes (Gabbro lake and Sandgirt lake) and an unflooded lake (Atikonak lake) were sampled to investigate the effects of reservoir impoundment on mercury (Hg) and terrigenous organic matter (TOM) loading in the Churchill Falls Hydroelectric complex in Labrador, Canada. Lignin biomarkers in TOM, which exclusively derive from terrestrial vegetation, were used as biomarkers for the presence and source origin of TOM-and for Hg due to their close associations-in sediments. In the two flooded Gabbro and Sandgirt lakes, we observed drastic increases in total mercury concentrations, T-[Hg], in sediments, which temporally coincided with the time of reservoir impoundment as assessed by 210Pb age dating. In the natural Atikonak lake sediments, on the other hand, T-[Hg] showed no such step-increase but gradually and slowly increased until present. T-[Hg] increases in lake sediments after flooding were also associated with a change in the nature of TOM: biomarker signatures changed to typical signatures of TOM from vegetated terrestrial landscape surrounding the lakes, and indicate a change to TOM that was much less degraded and typical of forest soil organic horizons. We conclude that T-[Hg] increase in the sediments of the two flooded reservoirs was the result of flooding of surrounding forests, whereby mainly surface organic horizons and upper soil horizons were prone to erosion and subsequent re-sedimentation in the reservoirs. The fact that T-[Hg] was still enriched 40 years after reservoir impoundment indicates prolonged response time of lake Hg and sediment loadings after reservoir impoundments. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. | ['canuel', 'lucotte', 'moingt', 'obrist', 'teisserenc'] | ","['canuel', 'lucotte', 'moingt', 'obrist', 'teisserenc']",4
40,"Comparing nitrogen isotopic signals between bulk sediments and invertebrate remains in High Arctic seabird-influenced ponds | The mass transport of nutrients by migratory animals can markedly alter the biogeochemistry and ecology of recipient ecosystems, particularly in nutrient-poor regions such as the Arctic. However, the role of biovectors in the global cycling of nutrients is often overlooked. Here we investigate nitrogen dynamics in two seabird-affected ponds in the Canadian High Arctic. The ponds lie at the base of a large seabird colony and have been greatly enriched in nutrients due to the input of guano and other wastes. Using sediment cores that span the last similar to 200 years, we measured stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) in bulk sediments as well from the subfossil remains of chironomid (Diptera) head capsules and Daphnia ephippia. The bulk-sediment samples from our seabird-affected ponds had elevated delta N-15 values relative to seabird-free sites elsewhere in the Arctic. In general, the chironomid delta N-15 profiles roughly paralleled those of bulk sediments in both study ponds, while the Daphnia profile remained relatively stable in contrast to the considerable variation recorded in the bulk sediments and chironomids. Interestingly, no apparent pattern emerged among delta N-15 values recorded in the bulk sediments, chironomids, and Daphnia between the two study ponds. The stability recorded in the delta N-15 profiles from bulk sediments relative to the more variable invertebrate profiles point towards the complexity of nitrogen uptake by chironomids and Daphnia at these sites. These data suggest that the bulk sediments are integrating the different fractions of the overall delta N-15 pool and thus may be most appropriate for reconstructing overall trends in lake trophic status. | ['blais', 'griffith', 'kimpe', 'michelutti', 'smol'] | ","['blais', 'griffith', 'kimpe', 'michelutti', 'smol']",4
41,"Comparing pre-industrial and post-limed diatom communities in Swedish lakes, with implications for defining realistic management targets | In the 1960s and 1970s, acidification was identified as a major environmental problem in Scandinavia, Great Britain and North America. In Sweden, a liming program was launched in order to counteract the effects of acidification on surface waters. More than 30 years after large-scale liming began, there is still debate about whether liming actually achieves its goals, i.e., to prevent acidification in acid-sensitive surface waters and to restore natural conditions in acidified waters. We used Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and analogue matching of diatom assemblages in surface sediment samples (recent conditions) from 31 limed lakes and pre-industrial samples from 291 reference lakes to help answer the question as to whether the Swedish liming program achieves its goals. Diatoms are important primary producers in lakes and established indicator organisms for lake-water quality. First we compared pre-industrial with post-limed diatom communities to address the question whether liming causes unnatural conditions, i.e., diatom communities that have not previously occurred in Swedish lakes. Second, we addressed the issue of what is a realistic condition to use as a reference (natural condition) or a target in management programs. We found that the diatom communities in limed lakes were not different from the communities in the reference lakes. Most of the limed lakes had one or more analogues within the reference data set and many of them had at least one within-lake analogue. Hence, liming does not create unique diatom communities in lakes. Based on this and previous paleolimnological studies in Swedish lakes we suggest a conceptual model integrating the natural lake condition, the historical human impact, and the recent and contemporary human impact, when defining realistic targets in management programs. | ['bigler', 'norberg', 'renberg'] | ","['bigler', 'norberg', 'renberg']",2
42,"Comparison of Cladocera-based water-depth reconstruction against other types of proxy data in Finnish Lapland | Lake depth is an important limnological attribute defining the structure and function of freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Lake levels have fluctuated and lake depths changed through the Holocene reflecting regional climate variations and sediment accumulation. Cladoceran remains preserved in sediments have been widely used for qualitative (P/L ratio) and quantitative (inference models) lake-depth reconstructions. In addition to estimations of prediction errors for performance power of modern data sets, it is important also to evaluate the reliability of reconstructed environmental values and to ensure that they are ecologically and paleoclimatically meaningful. In this study, we reconstructed the Holocene lake-depth history of a northern boreal lake using the Cladocera P/L ratio and a Cladocera-lake-depth inference model. These results were evaluated by comparison with reconstructions based on other proxies (aquatic macrofossils, sediment composition and sedimentation pattern) derived from three radio-carbon-dated sediment cores from the same lake. Whilst the reconstructions based on Cladocera and on the combination of other proxies yielded similar long-term trends, the absolute water depth values derived from the quantitative cladoceran model deviated from what was indicated by the other proxies. Therefore, we strongly recommend that also other, independent methods should be used simultaneously when reconstructing past water depths using Cladocera remains. | ['juutinen', 'korhola', 'siitonen', 'valiranta', 'weckstrom'] | ","['juutinen', 'korhola', 'siitonen', 'valiranta', 'weckstrom']",2
43,"Comparison of pollen and conifer stomates as indicators of alpine treeline in northwestern Canadian lake sediments | We compare fossil pollen and stomate assemblages in 29 lake sediment surface samples from mountainous regions in northwestern Canada to characterize the relationship between modern vegetation, and pollen and stomate deposition. Modern pollen spectra were dominated by arboreal taxa originating from lower elevation sites. Pinus pollen frequently reached 30% of the pollen sum, regardless of elevation. Alpine-tundra vegetation has lower pollen abundance, even in the alpine-tundra zone, where it dominates the sparse vegetation cover. Fossil stomates were observed in all but one site where trees currently exist in the vicinity of the lake, while no stomates were found in the sediments from alpine-tundra sites. The highest concentration of stomates occurred in lake sediments from closed-canopy forested areas. Our data suggest that different boreal forest types may be differentiated based on pollen assemblages and that the presence of stomates clearly distinguishes vegetation zones dominated by arboreal vegetation from alpine-tundra zones where trees are not present. | ['karst', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'szeicz'] | ","['karst', 'pisaric', 'smol', 'szeicz']",2
44,"A comparison of radiocarbon ages derived from bulk peat and selected plant macrofossils in basal peat cores from circum-arctic peatlands | Databases of basal radiocarbon (14C) ages from peatlands have been used extensively at regional and global scales to examine peatland initiation, land-cover change and carbon cycle dynamics. Many dates collected and analyzed before the 1990s are from bulk peat samples of organic-rich sediments, and such basal radiocarbon ages might have been either too young or too old due to inclusion of non-contemporary carbon via translocation from higher horizons. However, there is rarely a systematic assessment of this problem, especially for large datasets. Here we used AMS 14C dating of both bulk peat and individual macrofossils from the same basal horizon at each of 40 peatland cores across North America and Siberia to evaluate the differences between the two sample types. Our results show that there is no significant or systematic difference between ages derived from bulk material and plant macrofossils. We find that the greatest age overlap of 2œÉ calibrated age distributions occurred between bulk peat and aboveground macrofossils such as moss fragments, seeds, and herbaceous leaves, suggesting that the bulk material is contemporaneous with the aboveground biomass and active carbon uptake. Dates including wood fragments showed wider divergence compared to moss fragments, seeds, and leaves. We find no evidence for statistically significant and consistent bias introduced by 14C dating of bulk basal peat. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V. | ['finkelstein', 'garneau', 'holmquist', 'macdonald', 'massa', 'yu'] | ","['finkelstein', 'garneau', 'holmquist', 'macdonald', 'massa', 'yu']",1
45,"Consensus among multiple trophic levels during high-and low-water stands over the last two millennia in a northwest Ontario lake | We investigated the modern distribution of fossil midges within a dimictic lake and explored downcore patterns of inferred lake depths over the last 2000 years from previously published proxies. Modern midge distribution within Gall Lake showed a consistent and predictable pattern related to the lake-depth gradient with recognizable assemblages characteristic of shallow-water, mid-depth and profundal environments. Interpretations of downcore changes in midge assemblages, in conjunction with quantitative lake-depth inferences across a priori defined (based on diatom data) similar to 500-yr wet and dry periods, demonstrated that both invertebrate and algal assemblages exhibited similar timing and nature of ecological responses. Midges were quantified by their relative abundance, concentrations and an index of Chaoborus to chironomids, and all showed the greatest differences between the wet and dry periods. During the low lake-level period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA: AD 900 to 1400), profundal chironomids declined, shallow-water and mid-depth chironomids increased, chironomid-inferred lake level declined and the Chaoborus-to-chironomid index decreased. The coherence between multiple trophic levels provides strong evidence of lower lake levels in Gall Lake during the MCA. (c) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

48,"Cyclic development of permafrost in the Peatlands of Northwestern Alberta, Canada | Vegetation in thermally subsided peatlands (collapse scars) grades from the wettest part near the collapsing peat bank with Sphagnum riparium to successively drier conditions with S. angustifolium and S. fuscum until the peat plateau surface is reached, covered with Picea mariana-lichen woodlands. The same sequence can be found in the peat stratigraphy, where the charred surface of the treed peat plateaus (sylvic peat) is overlain by a sequence of Sphagnum riparium, S. angustifolium, and S. fuscum, capped by sylvic peat. Often several such sequences occur in the peat stratigraphy, indicating periodic permafrost degradation, triggered by fires, and regeneration. Radiocarbon dates show that such cycles can be as short as 600 yr. The earliest incidence of permafrost in the study area was dated at 3700 yr BP, indicating the end of the mid-Holocene warm period and the onset of the current climatic regime. | ['zoltai'] | ",['zoltai'],2

Our database consists of 268 peat cores from 215 sites located north of 45 degrees N. It encompasses regions within which peat carbon data have only recently become available, such as the West Siberia Lowlands, the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Kamchatka in Far East Russia, and the Tibetan Plateau. For all northern peatlands, carbon content in organic matter was estimated at 42 +/- 3% (standard deviation) for Sphagnum peat, 51 +/- 2% for non-Sphagnum peat, and at 49 +/- 2% overall. Dry bulk density averaged 0.12 +/- 0.07 g/cm(3), organic matter bulk density averaged 0.11 +/- 0.05 g/cm(3), and total carbon content in peat averaged 47 +/- 6%. In general, large differences were found between Sphagnum and non-Sphagnum peat types in terms of peat properties. Time-weighted peat carbon accumulation rates averaged 23 +/- 2 (standard error of mean) g C/m(2)/yr during the Holocene on the basis of 151 peat cores from 127 sites, with the highest rates of carbon accumulation (25-28 g C/m(2)/yr) recorded during the early Holocene when the climate was warmer than the present.

51,"Deglaciation and catchment ontogeny in coastal south-west Greenland: implications for terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycling | Here we present Holocene organic carbon, nitrogen, sulphur, carbon isotope ratio and macrofossil data from a small freshwater lake near Sisimiut in south-west Greenland. The lake was formed c. 11cal ka BP following retreat of the ice sheet margin and is located above the marine limit in this area. The elemental and isotope data suggest a complex deglaciation history of interactions between the lake and its catchment, reflecting glacial retreat and post-glacial hydrological flushing probably due to periodic melting of local remnant glacial ice and firn areas between 11 and 8.5cal ka BP. After 8.5cal ka BP, soil development and associated vegetation processes began to exert a greater control on terrestrialaquatic carbon cycling. By 5.5cal ka BP, in the early Neoglacial cooling, the sediment record indicates a change in catchmentlake interactions with consistent delta 13C while C/N exhibits greater variability. The period after 5.5cal ka BP is also characterized by higher organic C accumulation in the lake. These changes (total organic carbon, C/N, delta 13C) are most likely the result of increasing contribution (and burial) of terrestrial organic matter as a result of enhanced soil instability, as indicated by an increase in Cenococcum remains, but also Sphagnum and Empetrum.

52,"Deglaciation Chronology Inferred from Marine Sediments in a Proglacial Lake Basin Western Spitsbergen Svalbard | Sub-bottom sediment profiles and sediment cores show that the lacustrine sediments in lake Linnevatnet are underlain by marine sediments and a basal till that mantles the bedrock. The till was probably deposited by the glacier that during the Late Weichselian glacial maximum removed all pre-existing sediments from the basin. The cores were collected in closed basins, where continuous deposition is expected. The marine sediment in the studied cores is up to 8 m thick and consists of bioturbated clay and silt. Radiocarbon dates on shells from the base of the marine sequence suggest that glacial retreat from the lake basin occurred around 12,500 BP. This is more than a thousand years older than basal shell dates from raised marine sediments on the slopes above the lake. Typical ice proximal lithofacies were not identified in the cores. The stratigraphic record indicates both a rapid glacial retreat and that no younger glacial re-advances occurred. During the Younger Dryas local glaciers on western Svalbard were smaller than during the Little Ice Age. This is in sharp contrast to western Europe, where Younger Dryas glaciers were much larger than those of the Little Ice Age. | ['mangerud', 'svendsen'] | ","['mangerud', 'svendsen']",4
53,"Holocene deltaic sedimentation along an emerging coast: Nastapoka River delta, eastern Hudson Bay, Quebec | Eastern Hudson Bay is characterized by falling relative sea level as a result of post-glacial isostatic rebound, which makes the region a natural laboratory for rapid forced regression, where the evolution of deltaic systems and offshore sedimentation patterns can be studied. A multidisciplinary approach involving airphoto analysis, offshore geophysical surveys, sediment coring, and facies and diatom analyses was used in this study of the Nastapoka River delta. The delta has formed as a result of the fluvial erosion of emerged Quaternary sediments but is mainly subaqueous. Offshore, in the prodelta zone, the oldest deposits are glaciomarine, laid down when the ice front of the receding Laurentide ice sheet stood on the Nastapoka hills some 7700-6800 years BP. Lateral equivalents of this glaciomarine unit are presently exposed on land. The shallow-water platform of the delta shows a thin surficial unit of wave-worked sand that overlies fine-grained, deeper water deposits derived from erosion of clay soils in the river catchment a few centuries ago, probably during periods of intense thermokarst activity. As the isostatic uplift continues, the deltaic platform will gradually emerge and be incised by the river channel. | ['allard', 'hill', 'lavoie'] | ","['allard', 'hill', 'lavoie']",4

These lakes range from large oligotrophic lakes, to small tundra ponds, to coastal marine lagoons which are diverse in terms of ionic concentration and composition. The relationship between diatoms and 15 limnological variables is examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Specific conductivity is identified as the most important variable influencing the distribution of diatoms in the Truelove lakes. A Weighted Averaging (WA) calibration model is developed to predict diatom-inferred specific conductivity. The reliability of the model is tested by evaluating the correlation between observed and diatom-inferred values and determining the error of prediction by bootstrapping.

Basal dates from these two, c. 2m long, pear profiles are c. 9420 BP and c. 9250 BP. From another six peat sequences gross-stratigraphic descriptions and additional radiocarbon dates are available. Basal dates from two short (<1 m) pear profiles indicate further peatland expansion at c. 3635 BP and c. 1285 BP. The oldest macrofossils of tree birch are dated to c. 9500 BP and those of conifers, presumably spruce, to c. 8000 BP. Tree stands became rare in the study area after c. 2800 BP, but occasionally occur until present. Peatlands formed through terrestrialization of ponds or paludification of forested uplands. Between 9000 and 3100 BP the peatlands were wet rich fens. Beginning from c. 3100 BP there are marked changes in their surface hydrology, connected with climatic cooling and permafrost aggradation. Sphagnum species started to play a dominant role. Permafrost aggradation at the six pear plateau sites is tentatively dated to c. 3100 BP, c. 2200 BP and <600 BP. Nowadays the area is mostly dry peat plateau with interspersed thermokarst lakes. Generally, peat accumulation rates are lower in the upper layers, which consist mostly of Sphagnum peat, than in the lower layers of sedge/brown moss peat. This is most probably due to ceased accumulation or even erosion in the currently widespread dry lichen stage in the peat plateau. Very high accumulation rates are recorded from moist sites with incipient permafrost. This study supports previous multiproxy climate reconstructions in the area according to which temperatures were at least 2-3 degreesC higher during the mid-Holocene compared to present. | ['alekseeva', 'kuhry', 'oksanen'] | ","['alekseeva', 'kuhry', 'oksanen']",2
58,"Development of Sphagnum dominated peatlands in boreal continental Canada | Peat cores from five Sphagnum-dominated peatlands in boreal continent at Canada were analyzed for plant macrofossils. Results indicate that peatland development was influenced both by local autogenic and regional climatic factors. The general direction in peatland development from rich fen to poor fen to bog can primarily be ascribed to internal processes, especially peat accumulation. Quantitative paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on fossil moss assemblages indicate that all five peatlands were initially dominated by brown mosses with inferred pHs of approximately 6.0, and a water table at 5-15 cm below the surface of the peatland. Subsequently, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands developed with pHs of 4.0-4.5 and a water table at 15-30 cm of depth. Chemical factors triggered a rapid transition from rich fen (pH gt 6) to poor fen and bog (pH lt 5). The two most southerly peatlands are youngest, with basal dates of 4670 BP and 4230 BP. Sphagnum peat accumulation at these sites started at 2620 BP and 1790 BP, respectively. Two sites located at intermediate latitudes have basal dates of gt 5140 BP and 5020 BP, while the development of Sphagnum-dominated ecosystems dates back to apprxeq 3100 BP and 3710 BP, respectively. The most northerly site has the oldest basal date ( gt 7870 BP), and the oldest date for the initiation of Sphagnum peat accumulation ( apprxeq 7000 BP). The younger age of the peat deposits in the four southern sites is due to warm and dry climatic conditions during the middle Holocene that prevented peatland development until after 6000 BP when the climate gradually became cooler and moister. Farther north the climate was cool and moist enough to allow peatland development during the early to middle Holocene. In three southern peatlands, the development into a Sphagnum-dominated ecosystem took gt 2000 years, while at the more northerly sites Sphagnum became dominant after lt 1500 years. | ['bayley', 'gignac', 'kuhry', 'nicholson', 'vitt'] | ","['bayley', 'gignac', 'kuhry', 'nicholson', 'vitt']",2
59,"Diamictic sediments within high Arctic lake sediment cores: Evidence for lake ice rafting along the lateral glacial margin | Sediment cores from six small lake basins in the Canadian high Arctic reveal a gravel-rich (‚â§30% by weight) to gravel-poor (‚â•2%) diamict facies underlying massive, post-glacial, clayey silt. Ten other lakes contain a second diamict facies within what are interpreted to be glaciolacustrine sedimentary assemblages. The sedimentology, clast fabrics and fossil remains (diatoms, ostracodes and chironomid head capsules) within both diamict facies suggest that these deposits are not tills. Clast fabrics yielded low S1 (0¬∑41-0¬∑57) and high S3 (0¬∑09-0¬∑22) eigenvalues, placing them within the range of ice-rafted diamictons and glacigenic sediment flows. The high percentage of clast dip angles &gt;45¬∞ (15-61%), random clast azimuth and lower diamict contacts conformable to underlying current-bedded sediment favours an origin as a rainout or settling deposit. Samples of the matrix and scrapings of clasts from the diamicts revealed a diatom assemblage dominated by littoral and planktonic forms, such as are found in the littoral regions of the lakes today. This contrasts sharply with the assemblages within the overlying clayey silt, in which benthic forms predominate. Clasts are thus interpreted to have been rafted from the littoral areas of the lake. The process proposed to explain this is rafting by the lake ice cover in a glacial-marginal environment. Early season meltwater, impounded along the lateral margin of retreating cold-based glaciers, would buoyantly lift the lake ice cover and any adfrozen lake sediment. Higher lake levels and increased areal extent of seasonal freeze-on between the lake ice cover and the lake bed would allow the redeposition of littoral sediments to the benthic regions through greater lateral shifting of the ice cover as it broke up. Incision by meltwater streams into the lateral glacial margins would later isolate the lake, allowing seasonal warming of lake water, enough to support the growth and maturation of the ostracode and chironomid species found as fossils within the diamicts. | ['rod', 'smith'] | ","['rod', 'smith']",4
60,"Diatom-based Holocene paleoenvironmental records from continental sites on northeastern Ellesmere Island, high Arctic, Canada | Stratigraphic changes in diatom assemblages from four small lakes on northeastern Ellesmere Island, high Arctic, Canada, provide a proxy lake-ice cover and paleoenvironmental record. Low absolute diatom abundances and a benthic Fragilaria (sensu lata) dominated assemblage during the postglacial (<7.6 ka B.P.) to mid-Holocene record the moderating effects of locally retreating glaciers. Around 5.5 ka B.P. diatom concentrations begin to rise, reaching their highest levels (109 valves per g dry sediment) between 4.2 and 3 ka B.P., interpreted to be the warmest period in this region. Topoclimatic differences between lakes on Hazen Plateau and those lower in Lake Hazen Basin account for the initial decline in diatom abundances in the upper lakes after 3 ka B.P. This change is thought to reflect a lowering of the regional snowline, accordant with widely recognized Neoglacial advances on Ellesmere Island and Greenland. Lakes in lower Lake Hazen Basin maintained extensive summer ice free conditions until apprx1.9 ka B.P., after which diatom abundances declined, suggesting prolonged summer lake-ice cover through the remainder of the recovered Holocene record. Differences between the records presented here and those from coastal areas of the Canadian high Arctic highlight the unique topoclimatic characteristics and continentality of the Lake Hazen region, and possible effects that local marine environments may have had on coastal records. Such differences serve to demonstrate the inherent geographic variability of paleoenvironmental records from the high Arctic. | ['smith'] | ",['smith'],4
61,"The diatom biostratigraphy of tsunami sediments: Examples from recent and middle holocene events | The interpretation of diatom biostratigraphy is a little used technique in the study of onshore tsunami sedimentation. Evidence is presented from examples from three tsunamis in which sediments were either observed to have been deposited; documentary evidence attests to the presence of sediment sheets, or finally, in the case of palaeo tsunamis, morphological and stratigraphical evidence permits the interpretation of tsunami inundation and the subsequent deposition of sediment. Examples from Scotland and Canada, and preliminary results from Indonesia, illustrate distinctive diatom assemblages that are associated with tsunami sedimentation. These assemblages contrast with the sediments immediately underlying and overlying the tsunami sediment. Data is presented showing an often chaotic assemblage, attributable to the tsunami waves crossing many distinctive diatom habitats, from fully marine planktonic and benthic species, through the varied intertidal zone and finally over the onshore terrestrial environments. The deposits attributable to tsunami inundation, particularly in Scotland, disclose a high proportion (often in excess of 65%) of broken diatom valves, and an over-representation of centric species due to their greater resistance to erosion.

62,"Diatom- and chironomid-inferred eutrophication of Bouchie Lake, British Columbia | Diatom and chironomid analysis of sediments encompassing the past 400 years from Bouchie Lake, British Columbia, suggests two distinct periods of limnological conditions. Prior to 1950 AD, Fragilaria construens and F. pinnata are the most common diatom species, and Chironomus, Procladius and Tanytarsini dominate the chironomid record. Moderately low nutrient concentrations consistent with oligo-mesotrophic lakes are inferred. From 1950, the diatom assemblage is dominated by Stephanodiscus parvus, a eutrophic indicator, whereas the chironomid communities show a relative increase in littoral taxa coincident with lower head capsule abundance. Higher nutrient levels, specifically total phosphorus, which increased from 8 mu g L-1 prior to 1950 to 20 mu g L-1 currently, are coincident with midge communities indicative of lower oxygen concentrations. Observed biotic changes and nutrient levels inferred from the sediment core correspond to historical land-use changes. | ['cumming', 'hart', 'heinrichs', 'laird'] | ","['cumming', 'hart', 'heinrichs', 'laird']",0
63,"Diatom community response to multiple scales of Holocene climate variability in a small lake on Victoria Island, NWT, Canada | A lake sediment core spanning 9900 years, collected from a small lake on western Victoria Island, NWT, Canada, provides a high-resolution record of diatom community dynamics over the Holocene. Ten radiocarbon dates and Pb-210 dating provided the core chronology. Loss-on-ignition (LOI), magnetic susceptibility, biogenic silica content, and diatom concentrations provided information on changes in the sedimentary environment. LOI gradually increased over the Holocene whereas magnetic susceptibility showed an inverse trend. Biogenic silica content showed three distinct peaks spaced approximately 3000 years apart. Major shifts in diatom assemblages occurred at 8100-8000, 5800-5700, and 3800-3500 cal yr BP. There is evidence of diatom community response to centennial-scale variations such as the 'Medieval Warm Period' (similar to 1000-700 cal yr BP), 'Little Ice Age' (similar to 800-150 cal yr BP) and recent warming. Although recent changes in diatom community composition, productivity, and species richness are apparent they were surpassed at other periods throughout the Holocene. Variations of the taxa within the genera Staurosira, Pseudostaurosira, Fragilaria, and Staurosirella, usually combined into one genus in Arctic lake sediment studies, suggest these taxa provide useful insight into paleonvironmental questions.

64,"Diatom ecological response to deposition of the 833-850 CE White River Ash (east lobe) ashfall in a small subarctic Canadian lake | A <5 mm thick volcanic ashfall layer associated with the White River Ash (east lobe [WRAe]) originating from the eruption of Mount Churchill, Alaska (833-850 CE; 1,117-1,100 cal BP) was observed in two freeze cores obtained from Pocket Lake (62.5090 degrees N, -114.3719 degrees W), a small subarctic lake located within the city limits of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. Here we analyze changes in diatom assemblages to assess impact of tephra deposition on the aquatic biota of a subarctic lake. In a well-dated core constrained by 8 radiocarbon dates, diatom counts were carried out at 1-mm intervals through an interval spanning 1 cm above and below the tephra layer with each 1 mm sub-sample represented about 2 years of deposition. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and Stratigraphically Constrained Incremental Sum of Squares (CONISS) analyses were carried out and three distinct diatom assemblages were identified throughout the interval. The lowermost ""PreWRAe Assemblage (Pre-WRAeA)'' was indicative of slightly acidic and eutrophic lacustrine conditions. Winter deposition of the tephra layer drove a subsequent diatom flora shift to the ""WRAe Assemblage (WRAeA)'' the following spring. The WRAeA contained elevated abundances of taxa associated with oligotrophic, nutrient depleted and slightly more alkaline lake waters. These changes were only apparent in samples within the WRAe containing interval indicating that they were short lived and only sustained for a single year of deposition. Immediately above the WRAe horizon, a third, ""Post-WRAe Assemblage (Post-WRAeA)'' was observed. This assemblage was initially similar to that of the Pre-WRAeA but gradually became more distinct upwards, likely due to climatic patterns independent of the WRAe event. These results suggest that lacustrine environments are sensitive to perturbations such as deposition of ash fall, but that ecological communities in subarctic systems can also have high resilience and can recover rapidly. If subsampling of the freeze cores was carried out at a more standard resolution (0.5-1 cm) these subtle diatom ecological responses to perturbation associated with the WRAe depositional event would not have been observed. This research illustrates the importance of high-resolution subsampling when studying the environmental impact of geologically ""near instantaneous'' events such as episodic deposition of ashfalls. | ['falck', 'galloway', 'hamilton', 'hutchinson', 'nasser', 'patterson', 'spence'] | ","['falck', 'galloway', 'hamilton', 'hutchinson', 'nasser', 'patterson', 'spence']",4
65,"The diatom flora in the ultra-oligotrophic Lake El'gygytgyn, Chukotka | Lake El'gygytgyn, an impact crater lake in northeastern Siberia, was analysed based on water-column characteristics and the modern and sub-recent diatom flora. Vertical temperature, conductivity and oxygen profiles, as well as ionic concentrations in the lake water, reveal that Lake El'gygytgyn is a clear, cold-monomictic, ultra-oligotrophic high-Arctic lake with high light-penetration depth. We identified 113 diatom taxa, of which only 2 species are planktic diatoms. Cyclotella ocellata is the only quantitatively significant diatom present in the modern phytoplankton community, and is also predominant in a short sediment core, which probably reflects the mid- and late-Holocene environmental history of Lake El'gygytgyn. Pliocaenicus costatus var. sibiricus is also common but of minor importance.

Some 240 taxa were recorded, chiefly in Lake Weichselian and Early Flandrian material. The taxa were subdivided according to their halobion and pH relation.

68,"Diatoms of the peatbog sediments from Shemya Island (Aleutian Islads, USA) | Results of a study of diatoms from Holocene peatbog sediments from Shemya Island (Aleutian Islands, USA) are presented. The column of peat sediments (385 cm depth) was investigated (the formation of peat sediments began more than 9500 years ago). Sixty-seven taxa of 31 genera, 17 families, 8 orders and 3 classes were identified. According to results of taxonomical and eco-geographical analyses most taxa belong to the order Naviculales and family Pinnulariaceae and are benthic organisms with cosmopolitan distribution. Forms with different quality of frustule preservation were revealed. Centric diatoms demonstrate the best preservation in sediment. Of special interest is the dissolution of frustules in water body with presummably low pH value. Pattern of species relative abundance dynamics were studied. Several zones with characteristic diatom complexes are distinguished. Analysis of distribution of diatoms in the column showed that, apparently, in the past there was a shallow oligotrophic reservoir with a relatively low pH. Water level changed occasionally, but trophic level did not change over the period of the reservoir existence. –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–∏–∞—Ç–æ–º–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–π –∏–∑ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ–ª–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ —Å –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –®–µ–º—å—è (–ê–ª–µ—É—Ç—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∞, –°–®–ê). –í —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ –±—ã–ª–∏ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã —Ç–æ—Ä—Ñ—è–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é 385 —Å–º (—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –±–æ–ª–µ–µ 9500 –ª–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥). –ë—ã–ª–æ –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–æ 67 —Ç–∞–∫—Å–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –¥–∏–∞—Ç–æ–º–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–π, –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∞—â–∏—Ö –∫ 31 —Ä–æ–¥—É, 17 —Å–µ–º–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞–º, 8 –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫–∞–º –∏ 3 –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∞–º. –ü–æ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞–º —Ç–∞–∫—Å–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ-–≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∞ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ç–∞–∫—Å–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∏—Ç –∫ –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–∫—É Naviculales –∏ —Å–µ–º–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤—É Pinnulariaceae, –ø—Ä–∏—á–µ–º –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—Å—è –∫ –±–µ–Ω—Ç–æ—Å–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ—Å–º–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–Ω—ã–º –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–∞–º. –í—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã —Å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω—å—é —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—Ä–µ–π, –ª—É—á—à–µ –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –≤ –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—è—é—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–∏–∞—Ç–æ–º–æ–≤—ã—Ö. –û—Å–æ–±—ã–π –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–∞–Ω—Ü–∏—Ä–µ–π –¥–∏–∞—Ç–æ–º–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–π –≤ –≤–æ–¥–æ–µ–º–µ —Å –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º pH. –ò–∑—É—á–µ–Ω—ã –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–µ—Ä–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±–∏–ª–∏—è –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ —Å –≥–ª—É–±–∏–Ω–æ–π –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è, –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–æ –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∑–æ–Ω —Å —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–º–∏ –¥–ª—è –Ω–∏—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–º–∏ –¥–∏–∞—Ç–æ–º–µ–π. –ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤–∏–¥–æ–≤ –¥–∏–∞—Ç–æ–º–æ–≤—ã—Ö –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–µ–π –≤ –∫–æ–ª–æ–Ω–∫–µ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ, –≤–µ—Ä–æ—è—Ç–Ω–æ, –Ω–∞ –º–µ—Å—Ç–µ –æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–º —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª –Ω–µ–≥–ª—É–±–æ–∫–∏–π –æ–ª–∏–≥–æ—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω—ã–π –≤–æ–¥–æ–µ–º —Å –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –Ω–∏–∑–∫–∏–º –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º —Ä–ù. –£—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å –≤–æ–¥—ã –≤ –≤–æ–¥–æ–µ–º–µ –∫–æ–ª–µ–±–∞–ª—Å—è –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥—ã –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏, –æ–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ —Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–æ–¥–æ–µ–º–∞ –Ω–µ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—è–ª–∞—Å—å –Ω–∞ –≤—Å–µ–º –ø—Ä–æ—Ç—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –µ–≥–æ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. | ['chudaev', 'gololobova', 'krylovich', '–û', '–ê', 'neplyukhina'] | ","['chudaev', 'gololobova', 'krylovich', '–û', '–ê', 'neplyukhina']",2

70,"Diatoms and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) population dynamics: Reconstructions of salmon-derived nutrients over the past 2,200 years in two lakes from Kodiak Island, Alaska | The return of hundreds to millions of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), which have returned from the ocean to their natal nursery lake environment to spawn, can result in significant nutrient loading. By analyzing sedimentary diatom assemblages from nursery lakes, we demonstrated that a salmon-derived nutrient signal could be traced over time and be used to infer past sockeye salmon population dynamics. We conducted a apprx2,200 year paleolimnological study of two Alaskan sockeye salmon nursery lakes, Karluk and Frazer lakes. The two lakes are very similar, except that sockeye salmon were only introduced into Frazer Lake in 1951 (first spawners returned in 1956). In both lakes we found a strong correspondence between diatom assemblages and the number of adult salmon spawners recorded in the historical data (apprx40 and 70 years for Frazer and Karluk lakes, respectively). Given this robust relationship, we then used our analyses of diatoms from Karluk Lake over the past apprx2,200 years to gain insight into salmon-derived nutrient loading changes (which are directly related to the number of sockeye salmon spawners). The diatom record from Karluk Lake recorded dramatic species changes on both decadal and century timescales, and was strongly correlated with an independent indicator of sockeye salmon abundances, delta 15N. Together, these data suggest pronounced variability in sockeye salmon abundances at Karluk Lake over the past apprx2,200 years. The direct impacts of regional environmental variability were not likely responsible for the patterns apparent in Karluk Lake, as the diatom and delta 15N profiles from Frazer Lake were relatively stable prior to the introduction of sockeye salmon. Application of total phosphorus transfer functions to the Karluk and Frazer lakes' diatom records revealed that sockeye salmon carcasses substantially increased the trophic status in these lakes, which has important implications for the health of juvenile salmon that rear in nursery lakes. Overall, this paper illustrates the potential use of diatoms in reconstructing past sockeye salmon population dynamics, which in turn can lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms influencing abundances of sockeye salmon. | ['douglas', 'finney', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'smol'] | ","['douglas', 'finney', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'smol']",1

Sediment cores and water chemistry were collected from each of the study lakes, and chrysophyte stomatocysts were investigated from the top 0.25 cm of sediment (present-day) and bottom (i.e., bottom of short sediment core, pre-industrial) sediment samples. This study represents the first undertaking of chrysophyte cyst morphology and distribution on Svalbard. A total of 153 cyst morphotypes were described with light microscopy and/or scanning electron microscopy, of which 21 are new forms. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the present-day distribution of cysts is significantly related to pH ( p = 0.02), altitude ( p = 0.02), and Na+ ( p = 0.04). Marked shifts in chrysophyte cyst assemblages were recorded between the top and bottom sediment samples of most lakes. A recent study has demonstrated that Svalbard lakes receive atmospheric contaminants from both local and remote sources. The observed assemblage shifts may be the result of the combined effects of these point sources and long-range pollutants, or the effects of recent climate change, or both. | ['betts', 'piper', 'smol', 'zeeb'] | ","['betts', 'piper', 'smol', 'zeeb']",0

The organisms derive from distant sources as well as from the local arctic environment.

76,"The dynamics of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) assemblages in response to environmental change during the past 700 years on Svalbard | The impact of recent natural and human-induced environmental change on chironomid faunas on Svalbard has been investigated. The modern chironomid fauna was studied from surface-sediment samples collected from 23 lakes in western Svalbard. A total of 18 taxa was found, of which three had not been recorded previously from Svalbard. The influence of water chemistry and physical variables on the distribution and abundance of the modern chironomid assemblages was investigated using correspondence analysis and multiple regression. The chironomid assemblages fall into four groups, which are primarily influenced by pH, nutrient concentrations, water temperature, and water depth. Sediment cores were taken from three lakes to investigate changes in chironomid assemblages over the last 700 years. At two of the sites there is evidence for a response to regional climatic change occurring about 200 years ago and may have been associated with the 'Little Ice Age'. At the third site there is a response to local catchment changes, probably brought about, initially, by the establishment of a human settlement close to the lake 70 years ago, and subsequently, as a result of the abandonment of this settlement in 1988. | ['birks', 'brook'] | ","['birks', 'brook']",4
77,"Holocene dynamics of an inland palsa peatland at Wiyashakimi Lake (Nunavik, Canada) | This study examines the Holocene evolution of an inland subarctic permafrost peatland located on the north bank of Wiyashakimi Lake (Nunavik, northeastern Canada). The analysis of plant macrofossils allowed us to reconstruct the succession of the trophic conditions of a palsa and a filled thermokarst pond. The accumulation of organic matter began at around 6290 cal. y BP. The evolution of the site then followed three stages: a pond (6290-5790 cal. y BP), a minerotrophic peatland (5790-4350 cal. y BP) and an ombrotrophic peatland (from 4350 cal. y BP). The establishment of permafrost caused a palsa to form at around 170 cal. y BP, which corresponds to the coldest period of the Little Ice Age in northeastern Canada. A subsequent degradation of the palsa and the formation of a thermokarst pond were induced by the climate warming that began at the turn of the 20th century. The analysis of plant macrofossils from an adjacent filled thermokarst pond indicated three phases of development over a short 450-year period: subaquatic, minerotrophic, and ombrotrophic phases. When combined with previous studies of filled thermokarst ponds in northern Quebec, this result indicates that ponds are rapidly filling in with vegetation and acting as carbon sinks. | ['bhiry', 'langlais', 'lavoie'] | ","['bhiry', 'langlais', 'lavoie']",4
78,"Dynamics of peat plateau near the southern boundary of the East European permafrost zone | Detailed study of a peat plateau near the southern boundary of the East European permafrost zone has been performed. The botanical and palynological compositions of the peat to the depth of 10 m, its radiocarbon dates (the AMS method), and its physical and chemical characteristics have been determined. The accumulation of peat in this area began about 8300 years ago at the end of the Boreal period. In the middle of the Atlantic period, the rate of peat accumulation reached 1.44 mm/yr. During the warming phase in the Middle Subboreal period, the peat plateau was subjected to active thermal erosion; part of the peat was eroded. The processes of thermal erosion are also active at present and destroy the edges of peat mounds. At the same time, the gradual accumulation of peat on the plateau continues. An increase in the degree of peat mineralization is expected upon the establishment of aerobic conditions against the background degradation of the permafrost. Peat plateaus and large peat mounds have been the sinks of atmospheric carbon for a larger part of their history. In this context, we do not expect their significant negative influence on the climate in the future. | ['kaverin', 'kulizhskii', 'kuznetsov', 'marchenko', 'vagapova', 'panov', 'pastukhov'] | ","['kaverin', 'kulizhskii', 'kuznetsov', 'marchenko', 'vagapova', 'panov', 'pastukhov']",2

The fossil assemblages are indicative of ecological and climatic conditions similar to those on Edgeoya today. The sediments contain one of the first fossil beetles reported from Svalbard.

81,"Effect of climate change on delivery and degradation of lipid biomarkers in a Holocene peat sequence in the Eastern European Russian Arctic | Lipid biomarkers from a peat plateau profile from the Northeast European Russian Arctic were analyzed. The peat originated as a wet fen ca. 9 ka BP and developed into a peat bog after the onset of permafrost ca. 2.5 ka BP. The distributions and abundances of n-alkanols, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanes, n-alkan-2-ones and sterols were determined to study the effect of degradation on their paleoclimate proxy information. Plant macrofossil analysis was also used in combination with the lipid distributions. The n-alkanol and n-alkanoic acid distributions in the upper part of the sequence generally correspond to compositions expected from plant macrofossil assemblages. Their carbon preference index (CPI) values increase with depth and age, whereas those of the n-alkanes decrease. The different CPI patterns suggest that n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanols deeper in the sequence may be produced during humification through alteration of other lipids. Excursions in the n-alkanoic acid content also suggest an important contribution of invasive roots to the lipid biomarker composition. The CPIs associated with these compounds show that under permafrost conditions organic material from Sphagnum is better preserved than material from vascular plants. Increasing stanol/stenol ratio values and decreasing n-alkane CPI values indicate progressive degradation of organicmatter (OM) with depth. The n-alkan-2-one/n-alkane and n-alkan-2-one/n-alkanoic acid ratioswere shown to be useful proxies that can reflect the degree of OM preservation and suggest that both microbial oxidation of n-alkanes and decarboxylation of n-alkanoic acids produce n-alkan-2-ones in this peat sequence.

82,"Effects of diagenesis on strontium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen concentration and isotopic composition of bone | Paleodietary analysis based on variations in the trace element and stable isotopic composition of inorganic and organic phases in fossil bone depends on the assumption that measured values reflect in vivo values. To test for postmortem alteration, we measured 87Sr86Sr, 13C12C, 18O16O and 15N14N ratios and Sr concentrations in modern and prehistoric (610 to 5470 yr old) bones of animals with marine or terrestrial diets from Greenland. Bones from modern terrestrial feeders have substantially lower Sr concentrations and more radiogenic 87Sr86Sr ratios than those from modern marine feeders. This contrast was not preserved in the prehistoric samples, which showed almost complete overlap for both Sr concentration and isotopic composition in bones from the two types of animals. Leaching experiments, X-ray diffraction analysis and infrared spectroscopy indicate that alteration of the Sr concentration and isotopic composition in prehistoric bone probably results from nearly complete exchange with groundwater. Oxygen isotope ratios in fossil apatite carbonate also failed to preserve the original discrimination between modern terrestrial and marine feeders. The C isotope ratio of apatite carbonate did not discriminate between animals with marine or terrestrial diets in the modern samples. Even so, the ranges of apatite Œ¥13C values in prehistoric bone are more scattered than in modern samples for both groups, suggesting alteration had occurred. Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N values of collagen in modern bone are distinctly different for the two feeding types, and this distinction is preserved in most of the prehistoric samples. Our results suggest that postmortem alteration of dietary tracers in the inorganic phases of bone may be a problem at all archaeological sites and must be evaluated in each case. While collagen analyzed in this study was resistant to alteration, evaluation of the possibility of diagenetic alteration of its isotopic composition in bones from other contexts is also warranted. ¬© 1986. | ['de', 'paolo', 'deniro', 'hare', 'nelson', 'schoeninger'] | ","['de', 'paolo', 'deniro', 'hare', 'nelson', 'schoeninger']",0

The absence of the Karsa glacier in the Early and Mid-Holocene is reflected in downstream lake sediment sequences by zones of gyttja clay that experienced post-depositional magnetite (Fe3O4) dissolution and greigite (Fe3S4) authigenesis, due to organic matter decomposition and sulphate reduction. Between 3,000 and 2,500 C-14 yrs BP the Karsa glacier reformed and the accumulation of sediment with a higher minerogenic content took place, with the result that magnetite was preserved in the sediments. The mineral magnetic properties of different sediment types (algal/detrital gyttja) deposited in two lakes in the Abisko valley record the same climatic deterioration between 3,000 and 2,500 C-14 yrs BP, although these lakes have been isolated from a glacial influence during the Holocene. Gyttja deposited during the Early and Mid-Holocene was also subjected to magnetite dissolution (and greigite authigenesis in one lake) until the regional climate deteriorated between 3,000 and 2,500 C-14 years BP. Due to climate induced alterations in vegetation the limnology of the lakes changed and magnetite became preserved in the sediments. | ['snowball'] | ",['snowball'],2
84,"Environmental footprint of small-scale, historical mining and metallurgy in the Swedish boreal forest landscape: The Moshyttan blast furnace as microcosm | The history of mining and smelting and the associated pollution have been documented using lake sediments for decades, but the broader ecological implications are not well studied. We analyzed sediment profiles covering the past similar to 10,000 years from three lakes associated with an iron blast furnace in central Sweden, as an example of the many small-scale furnaces with historical roots in the medieval period. With a focus on long-term lake-water quality, we analyzed multiple proxies including geochemistry, pollen and charcoal, diatom composition and inferred pH, biogenic silica (bSi), visible near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS)-inferred lake-water total organic carbon (LW-TOC), and VNIRS-inferred sediment chlorophyll (sed-Chl). All three lakes had stable conditions during the middle Holocene (similar to 5000 BCE to 1110 CE) typical of oligo-dystrophic lakes: pH 5.4-5.6, LW-TOC 15-18 mg L-1. The most important diatom taxa include, for example, Aulacoseira scalaris, Brachysira neoexilis, and Frustulia saxonica. From similar to 1150 CE, decreases in LW-TOC, bSi, and sed-Chl in all three lakes coincide with a suite of proxies indicating disturbance associated with local, small-scale agriculture, and the more widespread use of the landscape in the past (e.g. forest grazing, charcoal production). Most important was a decline in LW-TOC by 30-50% in the three lakes prior to the 20th century. In addition, the one lake (Fickeln) downstream of the smelter and main areas of cultivation experienced a shift in diatom composition (mainly increasing Asterionella formosa) and a 0.6 pH increase coinciding with increasing cereal pollen and signs of blast furnace activity. The pH did not change in the other two lakes in response to disturbance; however, these lakes show a slight increase (0.3-0.5 pH units) because of modern liming. LW-TOC has returned to background levels in the downstream lake and remains lower in the other two. | ['biester', 'bigler', 'bindler', 'lidberg', 'meyer', 'jacob', 'myrstener', 'rydberg'] | ","['biester', 'bigler', 'bindler', 'lidberg', 'meyer', 'jacob', 'myrstener', 'rydberg']",4
85,"Environmental impacts around the time of Norse landn√°m in the Qorlortoq valley, Eastern Settlement, Greenland | Palynology, radiocarbon dating, and open-section stratigraphies from archaeological trenches are used to examine the impact of human activity around the time of Norse landn√°m on vegetation and landscape associated with a small farm (√ò34) in the Qorlortoq valley, Eastern Settlement, Greenland (61¬∞ N 45¬∞ W). Peat deposits from a mire abutting the Norse ruins revealed a discontinuous palaeoenvironmental record containing a possible hiatus from ca. AD 410-1020. Palaeovegetational data were recovered either side of this period. Pollen assemblages suggest that open Salix scrub dominated the landscape during the pre-settlement phase. The later phases of landn√°m resulted in the creation of hay fields and heavily-grazed grassy heath. Site abandonment is reflected by a re-expansion of Salix. This occurs shortly before the onset of deposition of a Sphagnum peat, dated to cal AD 1420-1630 (2œÉ) and reflecting an increase in mire surface wetness, probably in response to a deteriorating climate. Radiocarbon dates were obtained on peat and plant macrofossils sampled from either side of the proposed hiatus at two different but closely-spaced (<20 m) locations across the mire. These produced significantly different dates for the cessation of peat formation in the pre-landn√°m period (cal BC 2130-1770 and cal AD 240-410 respectively), but near-synchronous dates for the recommencement of peat growth (cal AD 890-1150 for peat and a probably more reliable interval of cal AD 1020-1190 based on plant macrofossils). It is suggested that this hiatus may represent the first direct evidence for peat cutting in Norse Greenland. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

86,"A 37,000-year environmental magnetic record of aeolian dust deposition from Burial Lake, Arctic Alaska | Environmental magnetism and radiocarbon dating of Burial Lake sediments constrain the timing and magnitude of regional aeolian deposition for the Noatak region of western Arctic Alaska for the last similar to 37,000 years. Burial Lake (68.43 degrees N, 159.17 degrees W, 21.5 m water depth) is optimally located to monitor regional dust deposition because it is perched above local drainage and isolated from glacial processes. Cores collected in the summer of 2010 were studied through the application of magnetizations and progressive alternating field (AF) demagnetization of u-channel samples, with additional data provided by computed tomography (CT) derived density, hysteresis measurements, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition experiments, organic carbon content, biogenic silica, physical grain size, radiocarbon dating of wood, seeds, and plant macrofossils, point source magnetic susceptibility, and Xray fluorescence (XRF). With similar magnetic properties to regional Alaskan loess deposits, low coercivity, highly magnetic material deposited during the late-Pleistocene contrasts with a high coercivity, weakly magnetic component found throughout the record, consistent with locally-derived detritus. The relative proportion of low coercivity to high coercivity magnetic material, defined by the S-Ratios, is used to reconstruct the regional input of dust to the basin over time. A four-fold decrease in the low coercivity component through the deglacial transition is interpreted to reflect diminished dust input to the region. Comparisons with potential sources of dust show that the timing of deposition in Burial Lake is largely consistent with general aridity, lack of vegetative cover, and increased windiness, rather than glacial advances or retreats. The influence from subaerial exposure of continental shelves cannot be ruled out as a significant far-field source of dust to interior Alaska during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), but is unlikely to have been the sole source, or to have contributed to increased dust in both the early and late Holocene.

87,"Evaluating environmental drivers of Holocene changes in water chemistry and aquatic biota composition at Lake Loitsana, NE Finland | This study presents a detailed analysis of geochemical and biotic proxies in a lake sediment profile to assess the effects of local and regional environmental drivers on the Holocene development of Lake Loitsana, situated in the northern boreal forest of NE Finland. Multi-proxy studies, in particular those that include a detailed plant macrofossil record, from the part of the northern boreal zone of Fennoscandia which has not been affected by treeline fluctuations, are scarce and few of these records date back to the earliest part of the Holocene. A 9-m sediment sequence of gyttja overlying silts representing the last c. 10,700 cal year, allowed for a high-resolution study with emphasis on the early to mid-Holocene lake history. The lacustrine sediments were studied using lithology, loss-on-ignition and C/N ratios, micro- and macro-fossils of aquatic and wetland taxa, diatoms, chironomids and accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating on terrestrial plant macrofossils. Our study shows that the local development at Loitsana was complex and included a distinct glacial lake phase and subsequent drainage, a history of fluvial input affected by nearby wetland expansion, and lake infilling in an eventual esker-fed shallow lake. Enhanced trophic conditions, due to morphometric eutrophication, are recorded as Glacial Lake Sokli drained and open water conditions became restricted to a relatively small Lake Loitsana depression. pH appears to have been stable throughout the Holocene with a well-buffered lake due to the local carbonatite bedrock (Sokli Carbonatite Massif). The fossil assemblage changes are best explained by a complex mixture of drivers, including water-body conditions (i.e. depth, turbidity and turbulence), rate of sediment input, and the general infilling of the lake, highlighting the need to carefully evaluate the possible influence of such local factors as palaeoenvironmental conditions are reconstructed based on aquatic proxies. | ['helmens', 'kuhry', 'luoto', 'salonen', 'shala', 'valiranta', 'weckstrom'] | ","['helmens', 'kuhry', 'luoto', 'salonen', 'shala', 'valiranta', 'weckstrom']",2
88,"Evaluating tephrochronology in the permafrost peatlands of northern Sweden | Tephrochronology is an increasingly important tool for the dating of sediment and peat profiles for palaeoecological, palaeoclimatic and archaeological research. However, although much work has been done on tephra in temperate peatlands, there have been very few in-depth investigations of permafrost peatlands. Here we present the analysis of nine peatland cores from Abisko, northern Sweden, and show that the presence of tephra layers may be highly variable even over a scale of < 10 km. Using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) combined with age-depth profiles compiled from radiocarbon (C-14) and Pb-210 dating of peat records, we identify the Hekla 1104, Hekla 1158, Hekla-Selsund and the Hekla 4 tephra layers. We also infer the presence of the Askja 1875 tephra, in addition to an unassigned tephra dating from between 1971-1987 AD in two separate cores. Five of the nine analysed cores do not contain distinct tephra layers. Volcanic ash deposits in northern Scandinavia are subject to both regional-scale variations in climate and atmospheric circulation, and local-scale variations on the order of tens of kilometres in topography, vegetation, snow cover, and ground permeability. The extreme inconsistency of tephra preservation within a small study area (similar to 3000 km(2)) brings into question the reliability of tephrochronology within permafrost peatlands, and highlights the necessity of alternative methods for dating peat profiles in this region. | ['borken', 'cooper', 'galka', 'gallego', 'sala', 'savov', 'swindle', 'watson'] | ","['borken', 'cooper', 'galka', 'gallego', 'sala', 'savov', 'swindle', 'watson']",2
89,"Evidence of changes in moisture transport efficiency across the Scandes mountains in northern Sweden during the Holocene, inferred from oxygen isotope records of lacustrine carbonates | Oxygen isotope records were obtained on three different carbonate components in a 3 m thick lake sediment sequence sampled in a small hard water lake in northernmost Sweden. The sediments were continuously deposited beginning after the last deglaciation at c. 9000 14C a BP. Parallel trends in the individual records of Œ¥18O, representing lacustrine carbonates precipitated during different periods of the year, are interpreted as reflecting long term changes in Œ¥18O of regional precipitation propagated by groundwater recharging the open basin lake. Isotopic analyses of modern lake water reveal nearly constant values of Œ¥18O throughout the year, in good agreement with the yearly average of Œ¥18O data obtained from precipitation collected at a nearby station. On the basis of stable carbon isotope records of the lacustrine carbonates and multicomponent radiocarbon dating, the hydrologic setting can be assumed to have remained unaltered throughout the Holocene history of the lake. Enrichment of 18O in the early Holocene carbonates is believed to be mainly an effect of a more vigorous flow of Atlantic air masses across the Scandinvavian mountain range than under mid-Holocene and present day conditions. Greater moisture transport efficiency probably led to a relative enrichment of 18O in regional precipitation because of diminished rainout of 18O from North Atlantic vapour. As indicated by consistent depletion of 18O with time in the lower part of the sequence, this flow pattern was gradually attenuated between 9000 and 5500 BP. The 18O depletion correlates with considerable changes in terrestrial vegetation of the lake catchment, as recorded by the content of macroscopic plant remains in the lake sediments. | ['edward', 'hammarlund'] | ","['edward', 'hammarlund']",0
90,"Evidence for Postglacial Paleo Oceanographic and Paleo Climatic Changes in Lake Melville Labrador Canada | Foraminifera, dinoflagellates and pollen in a radiocarbon-dated piston core from Lake Melville were used to reconstruct a postglacial history of the fiord oceanography and regional climate. Present bottom water salinity in Lake Melville is about 5.permill. lower than on the inner Labrador Shelf because of a shallow still in the Narrows at the fiord entrance. Foraminiferal assemblages suggest that about 5000 yr BP, fiord salinity was about the same as the inner shelf. The postglacial change in fiord salinity is best explained by a shallowing of the sill, preventing the entry of saline inner shelf bottomwater. A model of relative sea-level changes at the Narrows is proposed which shows that at 5000 yr BP, the sill was about 20 m deeper than present; at 7000 yr BP it was 50 m deeper, and it was 90 m deeper until the end of the marine maximum at 7500 yr BP. Pollen assemblages in the piston core indicate a succession of 4 major vegetation types in the Lake Melville drainage basin: from .apprx. 8000-7500 yr BP, low arctic tundra was replaced by shrub tundra; around 6000 yr BP, shrub tundra gave way to spruce woodland, which was followed by boreal forest around 5000 yr BP. A decline in absolute pollen concentrations during the past 4000 yr may indicate a recent climatic deterioration. Before forestation of the Lake Melville watershed, sedimentation in the fiord basin was 3-4 times higher than at present, but the maximum sedimentation rate of 0.26 cm yr-1 is much lower than in other large Canadian fiords, e.g., Knight Inlet. | ['mudie', 'vilks'] | ","['mudie', 'vilks']",4

94,"Can fish introductions alter nutrient cycles in previously fishless high-latitude lakes? | The additional input and enhanced cycling of nutrients derived from introduced fish can be a significant factor altering nutrient dynamics in oligotrophic lakes. To test this, we used a bioenergetic model to estimate the fish-derived nutrient load in Lake Kuutsjurvi, a historically fishless boreal lake of northern Fennoscandia. The lake was selected because of the absence of other anthropogenic stressors, a known stocking history and the possibility of quantitatively estimating the size-structure and biomass of the fish population through a mass removal. Subsequently, we used a mass balance model to compare fish-derived nutrients with other nutrient load pathways. For comparison over longer timescales, we used lake sediment records of diatoms, chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, C: N ratios and stable isotopes to infer whether fish introduction produced detectable changes in the lake trophic state, primary productivity and terrestrial nutrient input. Based on the nutrient mass balance model, we found that phosphorus and nitrogen derived from fish were 0.46% and 2.2%, respectively, of the total load to the lake, suggesting that fish introduction could not markedly increase the nutrient load. Accordingly, the palaeolimnological record indicated little increase in primary production but instead a shift from pelagic to benthic production after fish introduction. | ['lappalainen', 'mcgowan', 'milardi', 'weckstrom'] | ","['lappalainen', 'mcgowan', 'milardi', 'weckstrom']",2
95,"Fishing for diatoms: fish gut analysis reveals water quality changes over a 75-year period | Defining the reference state of some perturbed streams and rivers is challenging since their non-altered state is undocumented. Despite the near-absence of pristine sites in highly anthropogenic areas, information about aquatic communities that existed prior to human disturbance can be obtained from historic sources. Sediment coring is commonly used in paleolimnology to estimate past environmental conditions of lakes, but this technique is often not appropriate for studies of lotic systems. An alternative is to use diatom assemblages present in the guts of fish that were captured in the streams prior to significant human disturbance. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the biological integrity of several streams in Ontario and Qu,bec during the early twentieth century based on ""paleo"" diatom assemblages extracted from the guts of fish stored in museums. The Eastern Canadian diatom index (IDEC: Indice Diatom,es de l'Est du Canada) was used to evaluate the biological status of ""paleo"" and ""modern"" diatom assemblages. The IDEC shows the position of diatom assemblages on a general pollution gradient. The comparison of IDEC values calculated for the 1925-1948 and the 2003-2007 periods showed that several streams were severely polluted in the early 1900s. In general, present water quality has declined compared to the early 1900s. The biological integrity of only three of the 22 sites has increased. IDEC values were not influenced by the species of fish studied. | ['campeau', 'lavoie'] | ","['campeau', 'lavoie']",2

A minimum of 802 beetle individuals were recovered from a 2-m peat section, representing 51 taxa (18 identified to the species level) and 8 families. Trechus crassiscapus, Eucnecosum brunnescens, and Olophrum rotundicolle were the most common species found in the peat. The insect assemblage was quite stable through the study interval (5850-1950 BP). The formation of the palsa (where the peat section was excavated) occurred probably after 1950 BP, raising the soil surface above water level and preventing additional peat accumulation. The proportion of boreal forest species in the faunal assemblage is high (88%). The only arctic (tundra) species found were Amara alpina and Pterostichus arcticola. Many species were out of their modem distribution range, but since collection localities are scarce in subarctic Quebec, the modem range of these species may extend to the study site. A mutual climatic range analysis, employing beetles identified to the species level, showed that the mean July temperature of the study area between 5850 and 1950 BP was possibly 2.8-5.5 degree C higher than during the 20th century. This assertion is supported by other paleoecological data (pollen and charcoal remains) suggesting a cooling trend in the study area after 2000 BP. However, since the last 2000 years are missing from the sampled peat section, it was not possible to quantify the impact of the cooling trend on the beetle fauna. | ['elia', 'lavoie', 'payette'] | ","['elia', 'lavoie', 'payette']",2
97,"Fossil organic matter characteristics in permafrost deposits of the northeast Siberian Arctic | Permafrost deposits constitute a large organic carbon pool highly vulnerable to degradation and potential carbon release due to global warming. Permafrost sections along coastal and river bank exposures in NE Siberia were studied for organic matter (OM) characteristics and ice content. OM stored in Quaternary permafrost grew, accumulated, froze, partly decomposed, and refroze under different periglacial environments, reflected in specific biogeochemical and cryolithological features. OM in permafrost is represented by twigs, leaves, peat, grass roots, and plant detritus. The vertical distribution of total organic carbon (TOC) in exposures varies from 0.1 wt % of the dry sediment in fluvial deposits to 45 wt % in Holocene peats. Variations in OM parameters are related to changes in vegetation, bioproductivity, pedogenic processes, decomposition, and sedimentation rates during past climate variations. High TOC, high C/N, and low delta C-13 reflect less decomposed OM accumulated under wet, anaerobic soil conditions characteristic of interglacial and interstadial periods. Glacial and stadial periods are characterized by less variable, low TOC, low C/N, and high delta C-13 values indicating stable environments with reduced bioproductivity and stronger OM decomposition under dryer, aerobic soil conditions. Based on TOC data and updated information on bulk densities, we estimate average organic carbon inventories for ten different stratigraphic units in northeast Siberia, ranging from 7.2 kg C m(-3) for Early Weichselian fluvial deposits, to 33.2 kg C m(-3) for Middle Weichselian Ice Complex deposits, to 74.7 kg C m(-3) for Holocene peaty deposits. The resulting landscape average is likely about 25% lower than previously published permafrost carbon inventories. | ['grosse', 'hubberten', 'overduin', 'schirrmeister', 'schuur', 'strauss', 'wetterich'] | ","['grosse', 'hubberten', 'overduin', 'schirrmeister', 'schuur', 'strauss', 'wetterich']",2

A training set of 100 lakes from northern Sweden spanning a broad altitudinal and TOC gradient from 0.7 to 14.9 mg/l was used to assess whether vegetation zones and TOC can be modelled from FTIR spectra of surface sediments (0-1 cm) using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression. Preliminary results show that FTIRS of lake sediments can be used to reconstruct past changes in tree line and the TOC content of lake water, which is hardly surprising since FTIRS registers the properties of organic and minerogenic material derived from the water mass and the drainage area. The FTIRS model for TOC gives a root mean squared error (RMSECV) of calibration of 1.4 mg/l (10% of the gradient) assessed by internal cross-validation (CV) yielding an R-cv(2) of 0.64. This should be compared with a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diatom transfer function for TOC from the same set of lakes, which have a R-cv(2) of 0.61 and 0.31, and RMSECV of 1.6 and 2.3 mg/l, respectively. The FTIRS-TOC model was applied to a Holocene sediment core from a tree-line lake and the results show similar trends as inferences from NIRS and pollen from the same core. Overall, the results indicate that changes in FTIR spectra from lake sediments reflect differences in catchment vegetation and TOC, and that FTIRS-models based on surface-sediment samples can be applied to sediment cores for retrospective analysis. | ['persson', 'rosen'] | ","['persson', 'rosen']",0
100,"Frost peat mounds on Hermansenoya (Oscar II Land, NW Svalbard) - their genesis, age and terminology | Here we present research on previously uninvestigated frost peat mounds occurring on a peat bog in the southern part of Hermansenoya, NW Svalbard. Detailed characteristics are given of the environmental conditions of the peat bog and of the morphological features and surface structure of the frost peat mounds, as well as an analysis of the internal structure of one mound. Three types of frost peat mounds have been distinguished: disc-shaped mounds (low), mid-sized mounds with gentle sides, and high mounds with steep sides. Radiocarbon dating of the peat within the frost peat mound performed for the first time on Svalbard and a detailed analysis of the deposits demonstrated that in the high mound (1.3?m) there is an ice-peat core and peat cover without ice. There are three layers of peat of different ages separated by at least two hiatuses. A generalized history of the development of the peat bog from about 8 ka BP is established. The studied mound displays two development cycles unknown elsewhere. The older relic1t part of the peat mound was formed during a climatic cooling about 3.0-2.5?ka BP, while the younger part originated during the Little Ice Age (c. AD 1550-1850). Despite certain similarities of these mounds to some palsas, this term should not be applied to the mounds because they are smaller and their cores consist mostly of layers of massive injection ice, the presence of which indicates a pressurized system in their genesis. | ['jaworski', 'niewiarowski'] | ","['jaworski', 'niewiarowski']",2

The objective of this paper is to infer palaeoenvironmental variability from a 10.76 m long, OSL- and C-14- dated sediment core from Lake Ilirney, Chukotka (67 degrees 21'N, 168 degrees 19'E). We analysed high-resolution sediment-geochemistry (XRF), sedimentology (TC, TN, TOC, grain-size), mineralogy (XRD) and preliminary micropalaeontological data (diatoms and pollen) from the core as well as acoustic sub-bottom profiling data from the lake basin. Our results affirm the application of XRF-based sediment-geochemical proxies as effective tracers of palaeoenvironmental variability within arctic lake systems. Our study reveals that a lake formed during MIS3 from 51.8 (+/- 4.1) ka BP, following extensive MIS4 glaciation. Catchment palaeoenvironmental conditions during this time remained harsh associated with the continued presence of a catchment glacier until 36.2 (+/- 2.6) ka BP. Partial amelioration reflected by increased diatom, catchment vegetation and lake organic productivity and clastic sediment input from mixed sources from 36.2 (+/- 2.6) ka BP resulted in a lake high-stand similar to 15 m above present and is interpreted as evidence of a more productive palaeoenvironment coincident with the MIS3 interstadial optimum. A transitional period of deteriorating palaeoenvironmental conditions occurred similar to 30-27.9 ka BP and was superseded by periglacial-glacial conditions from 27.9 (+/- 0.8) ka BP, during the last glacial maximum. Deglaciation as marked by sediment-geochemical proxies commenced at 20.2 (+/- 0.8) ka BP. Our findings are compared with lacustrine, Yedoma and river-bluff records from across Beringia and potentially yield limited support for a marked Younger Dryas cooling in the study area.

102,"Heavy metal concentrations in peat profiles from the high Arctic | The concentration and possible sources of heavy metal input to a high Arctic mire in Kongsfjord, West Spitsbergen were examined; levels of lead, copper and zinc are highest in the surface humus closest to the carboniferous limestone cliff upon which seabirds nest. The concentrations of iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc and lead in two cores of peat increase markedly in the upper 5 cm of consolidated peat, with the highest concentrations found in the uppermost centimetre of peat. There has, therefore, been an increase in heavy metal loading to this High Arctic mire within the last 100 years. This cannot be attributed to the direct input of heavy metals from precipitation or coal dust from the local mines as the concentrations of the same elements in these materials are three orders of magnitude lower. It is only in the vicinity of seabird colonies that this pattern is shown and the concentrations (mu-g g-1 dry wt.) of lead, copper and zinc in faecal samples of kittiwake and glaucous gull are in the range 17-32, 35-65 and 63-260, respectively. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the faeces are close to those found in the surface layers of humus closest to the cliff. This indicates that the seabirds are acting as a vector for the movement of heavy metals between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. | ['headley'] | ",['headley'],0

Latnjajaure is a oligotrophic mountain lake. b. All cores contained many remains of rhizopods, most of them intact. Most broken tests could be reconstructed. Postglacial development of a lake could thus be elucidated for the first time. c. The sediment cores contained 24 species of Testacea, 41.6% of the recent fauna. The rank order of species forming 1 % or more of the total number in the cores is nearly identical with the rank order of recent species. d. The history of lake Latnjajaure is characterized by Centropyxis a√´rophila, an oligotrophic species. Periods of beginning eutrophication are indicated by a decrease of Centropyxis a√´rophila and an increase of Difflugia species, but typical eutrophic species were absent. A dystrophic phase in the development could not be ascertained by means of rhizopods. ¬© 1973 Dr. W. Junk b.v. Publishers. | ['sch√∂nborn'] | ",['sch√∂nborn'],4
106,"Identification of last interglacial deposits in eastern Beringia: a cautionary note from the Palisades, interior Alaska | Last interglacial sediments in unglaciated Alaska and Yukon (eastern Beringia) are commonly identified by palaeoecological indicators and stratigraphic position similar to 2-5m above the regionally prominent Old Crow tephra (124 +/- 10 ka). We demonstrate that this approach can yield erroneous age assignments using data from a new exposure at the Palisades, a site in interior Alaska with numerous exposures of last interglacial sediments. Tephrochronology, stratigraphy, plant macrofossils, pollen and fossil insects from a prominent wood-rich organic silt unit are all consistent with a last interglacial age assignment. However, six C-14 dates on plant and insect macrofossils from the organic silt range from non-finite to 4.0(14)C ka BP, indicating that the organic silt instead represents a Holocene deposit with a mixed-age assemblage of organic material. In contrast, wood samples from presumed last interglacial organic-rich sediments elsewhere at the Palisades, in a similar stratigraphic position with respect to Old Crow tephra, yield non-finite C-14 ages. Given that local permafrost thaw since the last interglaciation may facilitate reworking of older sediments into new stratigraphic positions, minimum constraining ages based on C-14 dating or other methods should supplement age assignments for last interglacial sediments in eastern Beringia that are based on palaeoecology and stratigraphic association with Old Crow tephra.

107,"Impact of Holocene climate change on silicon cycling in Lake 850, Northern Sweden | Diatom-rich sediment in a small subarctic lake (Lake 850) was investigated in a 9400 cal. yr BP sediment record in order to explore the impact of Holocene climate evolution on silicon cycling. Diatom stable silicon isotopes ( delta 30 Si BSi ) and biogenic silica (BSi) indicate that high BSi concentrations in sediment throughout the Holocene are associated with a lighter Si isotope source of dissolved silica (DSi), such as groundwater or freshly weathered primary minerals. Furthermore, higher BSi concentrations were favoured during the mid-Holocene by low detrital inputs and possibly a longer ice-free period allowing for more diatom production to occur. The diatom delta 30 Si BSi signature shows a link to changes in regional climate and is influenced by length of diatom growth period and hydrological fluctuations. Lighter Si isotopic values occur during the mid-Holocene, when climate is inferred to be more continental and drier, with pronounced seasonality. In contrast, a heavier Si isotopic signature is observed in the early and late Holocene, when oceanic influences are thought to be stronger and the climate wetter. The delta 30 Si BSi values have generally lighter signatures as compared with other studies, which supports a light DSi source. | ['cartier', 'conley', 'fritz', 'opfergelt', 'shemesh', 'stadmark', 'yam', 'zahajska'] | ","['cartier', 'conley', 'fritz', 'opfergelt', 'shemesh', 'stadmark', 'yam', 'zahajska']",2
108,"Changes in the importance of lotic and littoral diatoms in a high arctic lake over the last 191 years | Both habitat preferences and community associations for some of the most prominent pennate taxa in our profile were established using samples from the modern lake and its watershed. Habitat preferences were used to establish a simple indicator for the relative contribution of lotic communities in this lake (Lotic Index) and indicator taxa for both littoral (Achnanthes spp. and Cymbella spp.) and lotic (Hannaea arcus and Meridion circulare) communities. When profiled, the Lotic Index showed a clear positive relationship to sedimentation rate as recorded in the varves, while profiles of littoral indicator taxa show the opposite trends. It seems likely that the patterns we observed in the Lotic Index are related to changes in runoff. Apparently, there was a period of declining runoff beginning ca. two centuries ago and ending in the late 1800's. This was followed by increasing runoff lasting until the middle of the 20th century. A brief minimum occurred in ca. 1970 followed by a recovery by ca. 1980. A strong positive relationship was also found between the dates of major turbidites, exceptionally thick varves and the concentration of valves in the sediment. It is possible that many of the thicker varves in the profiles contain littoral material transported to the site of deposition by turbid interflows and underflows. For this reason, the concentration of valves in the sediment in our cores appears to be a proxy for sediment deposition from turbidity currents. | ['douglas', 'feeney', 'ludlam'] | ","['douglas', 'feeney', 'ludlam']",0
109,"Importance of the Rossendale Site in Establishing a Deglacial Chronology Along the Southwestern Margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet | The timing of deglaciation in the Lake Agassiz basin is critical in establishing the routing of meltwater and precipitation runoff from a 2,000,000-km2 region of central North America and in evaluating the influence this water had on rivers and oceans into which it drained. Dates of 12,400 .+-. 420 and 12,100 .+-. 160 yr B. P. for moss at the Rossendale site in Manitoba have long been a key for those advocating an ""early"" deglacial chronology in this region. However, new dates for wood from this site and paleoecological interpretations of ostracods, molluscs, and the dated moss all support a ""young"" deglacial scenario. Of particular significance is the fact that the dated moss, Scorpidium scorpioides, is a subaquatic type subject to contamination by old carbon dissolved from bedrock. In fact, most subaquatic moss may be unreliable for radiocarbon dating. For these reasons, the 12,400 and 12,100 yr B. P. dates are rejected. New dates of 9600 .+-. 70 and 9510 .+-. 90 yr B. P. for wood from the same organic-rich unit containing the dated moss, ostracods, and molluscs fit well with the ""young"" deglacial chronology of the southwestern Laurentide ice margin advocated by many. In short, the ice margin appears to have retreated into the southern Lake Agassiz basin after 12,000 and north of the Rossendale site by 11,000 yr B.P. About 10,000 yr B.P., following the Moorhead low-water phase, Lake Agassiz rose to the Campbell level. The dated organic matter at Rossendale was deposited in a lagoon behind the Campbell beach. | ['teller'] | ",['teller'],4
110,"Influence of Permafrost Type and Site History on Losses of Permafrost Carbon After Thaw | We quantified permafrost peat plateau and post-thaw carbon (C) stocks across a chronosequence in Interior Alaska to evaluate the amount of C lost with thaw. Macrofossil reconstructions revealed three stratigraphic layers of peat: (a) a base layer of fen/marsh peat, (b) peat from a forested peat plateau (with permafrost), and (c) collapse-scar bog peat (at sites where permafrost thaw has occurred). Radiocarbon dating revealed that peat initiated within the last 2,500 years and that permafrost aggraded during the Little Ice Age (ca. 250-575 years ago) and degraded within the last several decades. The timing of permafrost thaw within each feature was not related to thaw bog size. Their rate of expansion may be more influenced by local factors, such as ground ice content and subsurface water inputs. We found C losses due to thaw over the past century were up to 46% of the C available, but the absolute amount of C lost (kg m(-2)) was over 50% lower than losses previously described in other Alaskan peatland chronosequences. We hypothesize that this difference stems from the process by which permafrost aggraded, with sites that formed permafrost epigenetically (significantly later than most peat accumulation) experiencing less absolute C loss with thaw than sites that formed syngenetically (simultaneously with peat accumulation). Epigenetic peat from our site had lower C:N ratios as compared to Alaskan sites that have syngenetic peat. This difference could help predict the magnitude of C loss with thaw across a range or permafrost types and histories. | ['cornman', 'fuller', 'hoefke', 'jones', 'leewis', 'manies', 'waldrop'] | ","['cornman', 'fuller', 'hoefke', 'jones', 'leewis', 'manies', 'waldrop']",2
111,"Interactions between climate and landscape drive Holocene ecological change in a High Arctic lake on Somerset Island, Nunavut, Canada | This study presents a diatom-based analysis of the post-glacial Holocene environmental history at Lake RS29 on Somerset Island in the Canadian High Arctic. Earliest post-glacial diatom assemblages (10 200-10 000 cal yr BP) consisted mainly of small, benthic fragilarioid taxa. Poor diatom preservation in the early Holocene (similar to 10 000-6200 cal yr BP) is associated with warm conditions, as determined by pollen data from the same core and other paleoclimate estimates from the region. Analysis of this and other sites from across the Canadian Arctic suggest that zones of poor diatom preservation or diatom absence in lake sediment records may be associated with warm conditions. After 6200 cal yr BP, acidophilic assemblages consisting of Aulacoseira spp. and a suite of periphytic taxa indicate acidification since the mid-Holocene. During this time period, cooling causing changes in lake ice phenology was likely a major driver of the reconstructed mid-Holocene pH decline. Watershed processes, including reduced fluxes of base cations as the rate of sediment accumulation slowed, may also be contributors to long-term shifts in lake water pH and associated changes in diatom assemblages. The uppermost sediments in the Lake RS29 record were characterized by abrupt declines in Aulacoseira alpigena and increases in benthic diatom taxa Cyclotella sensu lato, suggesting an increase in lake water pH and longer ice-free seasons. | ['finkelstein', 'gajewski', 'paull'] | ","['finkelstein', 'gajewski', 'paull']",2

114,"Ip25 and Brassicasterol: The Biomarker as Ice Proxy for the Sea Ice Covering in the Arctic Ocean | Stable biomolecules play an important role in the oceans because they can be used to determine the origin and the translocation of the organic material such as sterols which are synthesized by plants. In recent times, a major focus has been on a new biomarker in the high latitudes, a highly branched Isoprenoid (HBI) as the new sea ice proxy 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl-7-(3-methylpent-4-enyl) Pentadecane (IP25, Ice Proxy with 25 carbon atoms). The stability of the proxies such as sterols and HBI is important because only an almost inert character of the molecules ensures its reproducible use as biomarker proxy. In this research, different analytical methods were used to check whether these components actually fulfill the requirements of duration and storage to be stable that possible degradation processes such as microbial degradation and autoxidation. However, duration and storage are proven negligible or can be treated as the secondary essential factors. For this purpose, samples of a sediment core from the continental shelf of the East Siberian Sea were analyzed. Samples from this core were stored (1) deep frozen directly after sampling (-30 degrees C) and (2) at 5 degrees C for an extended time period. The results show that the degradation processes are negligible or least only of secondary importance. The concentrations of the biomarker show good correlations. The ratio between Brassicasterol and IP25 (PIP25-Index) is not affected by the different storages. In addition, all measurements using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry result in nearly the same concentrations of the compounds. | ['manurung'] | ",['manurung'],2
115,"Isolation of lacustrine basins and marine regression in the Kuujjuaq area, northern Quebec, as inferred from diatom analysis | The Holocene sediment records of two lakes, located 50 km south of the Ungava Bay coast near Kuujjuaq have been examined using diatom analysis in order to trace basin isolation from marine influence. The succession of diatom zones clearly documents paleoenvironmental changes induced by glacio-isostatic uplift and regression of postglacial D'Iberville Sea through consecutive periods of marine occupation, isolation from the sea and subsequent lacustrine conditions. Diatom analysis proved to be an effective tool in identifying the position of the isolation contact in the sediment columns and in defining the related changes in paleosalinity and isolation dynamics. Based on the 14C-dated isolation contacts and the threshold elevations of both lakes, a tentative emergence curve has been reconstructed which is in agreement with curves from adjacent areas. The curve shows that, following deglaciation about 7000 years ago, the Kuujjuaq area experienced continuous and rapid emergence in the order of 5.7-5.8 m/century until 4800-4300 years BP. Thereafter, emergence slowed to a rate of approximately 0.9 m/century. -from Authors | ['allard', 'lortie', 'pienitz'] | ","['allard', 'lortie', 'pienitz']",2

117,"Lake-level reconstructions and paleohydrology of Birch Lake, Central Alaska, based on seismic reflection profiles and core transects | Lake-level history for Birch Lake, Alaska, was reconstructed using seismic profiles and multiproxy sedimentary analyses including sedimentology, geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, and palynology. Twenty-two seismic profiles (18 km total) and eight sediment cores taken from the lake margin to its depocenter at 13.5 m provide evidence for low lake stands during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Thirty-one AMS radiocarbon dates of macrofossils and pollen provide a century-scale chronology. Prior to 12,700 14C yr B.P., the lake, which now overflows, was either seasonally dry or desiccated for prolonged periods, indicating a severe period of aridity. Lake level rose more than 18 m between 12,700 and 12,200 14C yr B.P. before falling to 17 m below the level of overflow. Between 11,600 and 10,600 14C yr B.P. the water remained between 14 and 17 m below the overflow level. Onlap sedimentary sequences were formed during a transgression phase between 10,600 and 10,000 14C yr B.P. Between 10,000 and about 8800 14C yr B.P. the lake was between 6 and 9 m below the overflow level. Lake level again rose, approaching the overflow level, between 8800 and 8000 14C yr B.P. Seismic and core evidence of minor erosional events suggest lowstands of 2-6 m until 4800 14C yr B.P. There have been no prolonged periods of lake-level depression since that time. The major restructuring of the climate system during deglaciation evidently generated a complex set of fluctuations in effective moisture in interior Alaska, which likely affected eolian processes and vegetation development, as well as lake levels. | ['abbott', 'edward', 'finney', 'kelt'] | ","['abbott', 'edward', 'finney', 'kelt']",4
118,"Lake Oulujarvi Finland Main Holocene Developmental Phases and Associated Geomorphic Events | It is demonstrated mainly by leveling, the interpretation of air photographs, radioC-dated pollen analyses from the submerged peat bogs and the study of erosional and depositional forms that Lake Oulujarvi, the 5th largest lake in Finland, was depressed to such an extent by the Weichselian ice sheet during deglaciation that, the basin with its surroundings was subsequently covered by the waters of the Baltic. Subaquatic meltwater action, directed at the same time through the depressions in the lake, deposited an esker chain which imposed a considerable shallower configuration upon the topography of the lake. As the earth's crust rose most rapidly near the threshold of the lake in the west, the regressive develpment of the shore of the basin became transgressive in connection with isolation from the Baltic .apprx. 8400-8300 B.P., with the result that the surface area of the lake has doubled since that time. The submerged peat deposits, the most concrete proof of this transgressive development, made it possible to estimate the gradient of shorelines of ages 3700-3600 and 1400-1300 radiocarbon years. Linum usitatissimum pollen was found in the same shore zones. The shore ridges deposited by the rising water level, which seems then to have adopted to a lowering trend during the 20th century as far as the HW [high water] and MW [mean water] levels are concerned, display an increase in height towards the present time. It is clear from both of the ridges and from those of the time of regressive shoreline displacement that the bases of the shore ridges are the result of wave action; the visible forms themselves are for the most part of aeolian origin, the direction of the whole formation being determined by that of the base. The most significant changes due to the lowered water level after regulation of the lake, started in 1951, are the decrease in littoral processes and the paludification of the exposed cut-and-built terraces. | ['keranen', 'koutaniemi'] | ","['keranen', 'koutaniemi']",4
119,"Lake sediment multi-taxon DNA from North Greenland records early post-glacial appearance of vascular plants and accurately tracks environmental changes | High Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate changes, but retrieval of paleoecological data is challenging due to low productivity and biomass. At the same time, Arctic soils and sediments have proven exceptional for long-term DNA presentation due to their constantly low temperatures. Lake sediments contain DNA paleorecords of the surrounding ecosystems and can be used to retrieve a variety of organismal groups from a single sample. In this study, we analyzed vascular plant, bryophyte, algal (in particular diatom) and copepod DNA retrieved from a sediment core spanning the Holocene, taken from Bliss Lake on the northernmost coast of Greenland. A previous multi-proxy study including microscopic diatom analyses showed that this lake experienced changes between marine and lacustrine conditions. We inferred the same environmental changes from algal DNA preserved in the sediment core. Our DNA record was stratigraphically coherent, with no indication of leaching between layers, and our cross-taxon comparisons were in accordance with previously inferred local ecosystem changes. Authentic ancient plant DNA was retrieved from nearly all layers, both from the marine and the limnic phases, and distinct temporal changes in plant presence were recovered. The plant DNA was mostly in agreement with expected vegetation history, but very early occurrences of vascular plants, including the woody Empetrum nigrum, document terrestrial vegetation very shortly after glacial retreat. Our study shows that multi-taxon metabarcoding of sedimentary ancient DNA from lake cores is a valuable tool both for terrestrial and aquatic paleoecology, even in low-productivity ecosystems such as the High Arctic.

120,"Changes in lake stratification and oxygen distribution inferred from two contrasting records of magnetotactic bacteria and diatoms | Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) and diatoms produce hard parts on seasonal timescales that continuously becomes embedded in various soft sediment archives. Consequently, they can, and are, frequently used to reconstruct past environmental conditions in oceans, fjords, and freshwater basins. In this study, we observe how these two cosmopolitan creatures can be used to track vertical shifts in the distribution of oxygen in a small mountain lake situated in western Norway. Several short and long sediment cores have been retrieved from the lake, allowing for a detailed reconstruction that spans the last 2500 years. During periods of enhanced runoff from the catchment the Oxic-Anoxic Transition Zone (OATZ) is lowered down to the lake-sediment interface, due to increased convection. We posit that this condition reduces the concentration of microaerophilic magnetite-producing MTB, an interpretation partly supported by rock magnetic analyzes. Preservation of diatom frustules is, however, improved whenever this oxygen-rich scenario prevails. Similarly, when runoff is low, and the OATZ is lifted above the lake sediment interface, MTB concentration seems to increase, whereas dissolution of diatoms is more common. This consistent antiphase relationship between MTB concentration and diatom preservation, occurring on a multidecadal timescale during lowest reconstructed lake-water pH in the lake's history, suggest a coupled response to subtle changes in external environmental variables that affect catchment and lake hydrology. | ['larsen', 'paasche'] | ","['larsen', 'paasche']",2

Diatom stratigraphic changes and the diatom-inferred patterns of limnological change following the retreat of Holocene marine waters of the Tyrrell Sea revealed a highly variable Holocene lake trajectory associated with successional shifts in lake catchment vegetation and soil development. The main trends observed in the Holocene history of Lake Kachishayoot are: (1) a progressive loss of alkalinity over time; and (2) abrupt increases in DOC and water colour that coincide with the arrival of spruce (Picea mariana) in the catchment. Reconstructed DOC allowed the estimation of past depths of ultraviolet (UV) penetration in the water-column of Lake Kachishayoot. Past variations in biological UV exposure were inferred using optical models based on DOC concentrations and the response curves for DNA damage and UV photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The palaeoecological analyses revealed large changes in the underwater photobiological environment over the course of the Holocene period, from extremely high UV exposure after the initial formation of the lake and its isolation from the sea, to an order-of-magnitude lower biological UV exposure under the present conditions of catchment vegetation. | ['pienitz', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'vincent'] | ","['pienitz', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'vincent']",4

Sediments from Lake Torfadalsvatn in northern Iceland contain at least four primary volcanic tephras that belone to ash zone I in the North Atlantic deep-sea cores. We chemically define these basaltic/rhyolitic tephras and the high resolution allows us to date them about 10,800, 10,600, 9300 and 8900 BP. This detailed tephrostratigraphy will act as a refined dating and correlation tool in the North Atlantic region and enable calibration between different absolute chronologies. The pollen stratigraphy of the sediments suggests that by 10.400 14C years BP plant colonization of coastal north Iceland had begun. The pollen stratigraphy shows a succession of pioneer plants, from open tundra vegetation towards birch-juniper woodland, which probably also reflects a transition from a cool climiate at 10,400 BP to conditions similar to today's sub-polar oceanic climate around 9200 BP.

123,"Landscape Features Vegetation and Developmental History of a Patterned Fen in Southeastern Labrador Canada | A general description of landforms, vegetation and environmental characteristics of Leech Lake Peatland, a patterned mire complex located on the Eagle Plain, southeastern Labrador, is presented. Particular emphasis is given to the developmental history of a minerotrophic mire, Leech Fen, and to the process of pattern (string-flark) formation. Nine floristic assemblages are recognized by the releve method. The node are characteristic of specific landforms related to a gradient of substratum height above the water table. The water chemistry is typical of poor fens: pH 4.7-6.1; Ca2+ < 2.0 mg l-1; conductivity 4.5-11 .mu.S [microsiemen] cm-1. Lateral water movement down the slope of patterned fens occurs through 4 pathways: sheet flow across the fen surface; surface flow in narrow channels along fen margins; surface flow in channels in strings; and percolation through near-surface layers of peat. The development of surface patterns is largely dependent on topography and water movement. Steep slopes within large inputs of water have terraces of alternating strings and deep pools; gentle slopes or areas with little water movement are generally unpatterned. Substratum topography and the distribution of surface features are unrelated. The lower part of Leech Fen developed in a shallow bay of Leech Lake with the present shoreline stabilized by a forested ice-push ridge. In the upper part of the fen, peat growth progressed slowly up the slope. Most of the initial peat accumulation in the fen occurred after 4500 B.P. Sedges dominated the early vegetation, with shrubs increasing in importance later. Pattern formation did not occur until after the shrub vegetation had become established. A proposed process for the development of the surface pattern of strings and flarks includes 3 parts: development of an irregular surface of hummocks and hollows; gradual expansion and joining of depressions across the slope controlled by differential rates of peat accumulation; and expansion and coalescence of pools through active peat degradation, which can be observed in Leech Lake Peatland at present. Once formed, pools are permanent features on the mire surface in which degradative processes remove all allochthonous and autochthonous materials. | ['foster', 'king'] | ","['foster', 'king']",2

Analysis of coretop sediment samples allowed to distinguish four modem assemblages. The specific habitat preferences of these species groups, such as water depth and salinity, were then used to interpret past environmental changes on the basis of two radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the eastern middle shelf region, i.e., obtained from the Yana (51 m water depth) and Lena (45 m water depth) palaeovalleys. Despite the water depth difference of the two core sites, all downcore data document uniform fossil evidence for a gradual transformation of the Laptev Sea shelf from a terrestrial to a marine environment due to the southward transgressing sea. Three major phases have been recognized. These reflect: (1) a nearshore brackish-water environment of the initial stage of inundation (11.3-11.1 in the Yana and 11.2-10.8 cal. ka in the Lena palaeovalley); (2) a shallow inner-shelf, fluvially affected environment (11.1-10.3 and 10.8-8.2 cal. ka); (3) a modem-like marine environment which eventually became established since 10.8 and 8.2 cal. ka, depending on the specific water depth of each core site.

125,"Late Holocene diatom assemblages in a lake-sediment core from Central Kamchatka, Russia | Fossil diatom assemblages in a sediment core from a small lake in Central Kamchatka (Russia) were used to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental conditions of the late Holocene. The waterbody may be a kettle lake that formed on a moraine of the Two-Yurts Lake Valley, located on the eastern slope of the Central Kamchatka Mountain Chain. At present, it is a seepage lake with no surficial outflow. Fossil diatom assemblages show an almost constant ratio between planktonic and periphytic forms throughout the record. Downcore variations in the relative abundances of diatom species enabled division of the core into four diatom assemblage zones, mainly related to changes in abundances of Aulacoseira subarctica, Stephanodiscus minutulus, and Discostella pseudostelligera and several benthic species. Associated variations in the composition and content of organic matter are consistent with the diatom stratigraphy. The oldest recovered sediments date to about 3220 BC. They lie below a sedimentation hiatus and likely include reworked deposits from nearby Two-Yurts Lake. The initial lake stage between 870 and 400 BC was characterized by acidic shallow-water conditions. Between 400 BC and AD 1400, lacustrine conditions were established, with highest contributions from planktonic diatoms. The interval between AD 1400 and 1900 might reflect summer cooling during the Little Ice Age, indicated by diatoms that prefer strong turbulence, nutrient recycling and cooler summer conditions. The timing of palaeolimnological changes generally fits the pattern of neoglacial cooling during the late Holocene on Kamchatka and in the neighbouring Sea of Okhotsk, mainly driven by the prevailing modes of regional atmospheric circulation. | ['diekmann', 'dirksen', 'dirksen', 'herzschuh', 'hoff', 'hubberten', 'meyer', 'van', 'den', 'bogaard'] | ","['diekmann', 'dirksen', 'dirksen', 'herzschuh', 'hoff', 'hubberten', 'meyer', 'van', 'den', 'bogaard']",4
126,"A late holocene record of landscape degradation from Heygsvatn, the Faroe Islands | Diatom, magnetic susceptibility and loss-on-ignition (LOI) analyses of a 9-metre sediment core from Heygsvatn (Suduroy, the Faroe Islands) were used to investigate the response of lake and catchment to mid-Late Holocene environmental change. A 30-lake training set from Faroese lakes was also used to explore the relationships between diatoms and environmental variables and assist in the interpretation of the diatom stratigraphy. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that lake depth, light penetration, total phosphorus (TP), pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were the most significant variables affecting diatom distribution in Faroese lakes (p < 0.06). Nine C-14 AMS dates indicated that the sediment record covered the last similar to 5700 years. Exceptionally high rates of sediment accumulation, an increase in LOI and magnetic susceptibility and inversion of radiocarbon dates suggested that a period of elevated soil erosion occurred at Heygsvatn ca. 1700-1200cal. yr. BP. Because this erosion pre-dates the arrival of humans the most likely cause is climate deterioration (cooler, wetter conditions). The diatom stratigraphy supports this hypothesis by showing that during the period of erosion the lake was deeper or/or more depauperate in TP, consistent with the climate becoming wetter and leading to increased lake flushing. Subsequently, with sustained sediment erosion, the lake became more shallow and pH increased as the lake infilled. In combination, the proxies support the idea that the climate became wetter ca. 1700-1200cal. yr.

127,"Late Holocene palaeohydrology in Eastern Quebec (Canada): the contribution of small alluvial fans | The late Holocene (from 3500 yr BP to present) in eastern North America is characterised by a marked rise of water levels in lakes and by the accumulation of numerous peat bogs. According to a number of researchers, this could be due to an increase in winter precipitations that would have resulted in large water volumes released by snowmelt, inducing groundwater recharge and rise of water bodies such as lakes and aquifers. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by stratigraphical studies of small alluvial fans in Quebec. Radiocarbon dates from four small alluvial fans in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspesie regions indicate that these fans have been formed in the last 3500 years, due to an increase in forest runoff associated with spring snowmelt. | ['hetu'] | ",['hetu'],1
128,"Late Holocene paleoecohydrology and carbon accumulation estimates from two boreal peat bogs in eastern Canada: Potential and limits of multi-proxy archives | The stratigraphy of four peat sequences collected in two peat bogs located in the Eastmain River watershed (52 degrees N, 76 degrees W), James Bay lowlands, Quebec, Canada, was investigated to reconstruct past hydroclimatic conditions of peat accumulation and associated carbon dynamics during the late Holocene. Analyses of macrofossils, testate amoebae, peat humification, C/N ratio and bulk density were performed at high-resolution along each peat core, allowing the potential of each proxy indicator under varying nutrient status and hydroclimatic conditions to be evaluated. Some synchronous changes were recorded both within and between peatlands, suggesting the influence of allogenic factors in the development of these peatlands. Other reconstructed changes have highlighted autogenic succession processes related to the local geomorphic and hydrologic context. Highest peat carbon accumulation rates (LORCA) were correlated with either wet conditions or high woody debris percentages, suggesting that residence time of the biomass in the acrotelm and the nature of plant material can both influence carbon accumulation rates in peat bogs. This study provides the first high-resolution paleoecohydrological reconstructions from the mid-boreal ecoregion of eastern Canada, a region in which peatlands occupy 30 to 60% of the land surface.

This study is supported by two AMS C-14 dates (27, 200 yrs BP and 8,762 yrs BP) at the bottom and topmost litho-unit of the trench, respectively. The pollen record provides an evidence of a warm interval at about 27,200 yr BP (Late Weichselian and MIS 3) and cooling episode around 8,762 yr BP.

130,"Late Pleistocene to early Holocene environmental changes on Store Koldewey, coastal north-east Greenland | A lake sediment sequence from southern Store Koldewey, north-east Greenland, has been investigated using a multidisciplinary approach, including geophysical, geochemical, biogeochemical, biological and sedimentological methods. Chronological constraints are provided by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating of bulk sediment and complemented with published water moss ages. The record consists of three major sediment units. Their individual structural, textural, geophysical and geochemical characteristics indicate variable input of sediment and meltwater due to variable proximity of the ice margin and therefore reflect the growth and decay of a local glacier during the late Weichselian. Radiocarbon dating of bulk sediment samples from the lowermost unit gave ages of 42 to 34 calibrated thousand years (cal Ky B.P.) and indicates that this material is redeposited in the lake basin during or after the ice advance at the end of the Pleistocene. Increased meltwater and sediment input from a retreating ice margin following the Younger Dryas is indicated by the occurrence of a sandy to gravely section. Fine-grained and laminated sediments were deposited during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and indicate calm sedimentation conditions with an ice margin outside of the lake catchment. The reoccurrence of coarse sediments during the early Holocene may indicate increased meltwater input in response to the cold spell at about 9.3 Kya with increased snow accumulation rather than fluctuations of local glaciers. The dating results furthermore show that AMS C-14 dating of bulk sediment samples deposited during glacier decay in High Arctic environments can give problematic ages. | ['bennike', 'klug', 'wagner'] | ","['bennike', 'klug', 'wagner']",2
131,"Late Pleistocene Stratigraphy at Harrinkangas Kauhajoki Western Finland | In 1985, organic and associated sediments were discovered filling a kettle-like hollow in glaciofluvial gravels and sands, the latter interpreted as an esker. The organic sediments comprise an upward coarsening sequence recording the infill of a small lake basin by inflow of a stream. Periglacial structures in the stream sediments include cryoturbation and a thermal contraction crack. The sediments are overlain by grey clay-rich till and related sediments. Detailed analyses of the till sediments include grain size, fabric, clast composition, mineralogy and geochemistry. The results of these investigations indicate that the till was deposited predominantly as lodgement by ice moving south-southeastwards. The till complex is here formally defined as the Kauhajoki Till Formation. Retreat of the ice was followed by reworking of local deposits to form littoral and beach sediment. Pollen analysis from the sediments indicates a tree-dominated vegetation with Pinus, Picea and Betula the important taxa, in the lower half of the profile, being replaced by a herb-dominated flora in the upper part. The implication of this change is discussed, possible correlatives presented and the sequence is tentatively interpreted as representing the end of an interglacial event, possibly the Eemian Stage. The climatic deterioration recorded may represent the transition to the Weichselian cold Stage. Diatom analyses indicate that the lake sediments were deposited in freshwater, and that the till was derived in part from interglacial marine sediments. Absolute date determinations give the following results: C14, > 42ka; TL, 130-146ka; U series 88+14-12ka. These results are discussed. On the basis of the results the Harrinkangas esker is thought to be of late Saalian age, the lake may represent part of the Eemian and earliest Weichselian stages and the glaciation is probably the Late Weichselian advance. | ['alhonen', 'forman', 'gibbard', 'jungner', 'peglar', 'salomaa', 'suksi', 'vuorinen'] | ","['alhonen', 'forman', 'gibbard', 'jungner', 'peglar', 'salomaa', 'suksi', 'vuorinen']",2

The base of the studied exposure is .apprx. 2500 yr old, whereas the sediment at a depth of 4-9 cm is dated .apprx. 650 yr old. The sampling interval for pollen averages 1 sample every 39 yr. The section is described in terms of the lithology of the inorganic matrix, in the plant growth form and moisture preference of the pollen taxa, and in the variations in the influx of exotic pollen (Alnus, Picea and Pinus). Principal Components Analysis and clustering of pollen levels were used to zone 5 different groupings of the pollen taxa objectively. Both relative and absolute pollen values were used in these various steps. Pollen accumulation varied between 24-14,300 grains cm-2 yr-1 with a median value of 501. Biozones [13] are recognized primarily from changes in the rates of pollen accumulation and diversity. The broad climatic interpretation of the pollen stratigraphy has similarities and differences from nearby glacial moraine chronologies. Sharp increases in exotic pollen (especially Alnus) are provisionally associated with major advection of southerly air toward Cumberland Peninsula, southeastern Baffin Island. | ['andrew', 'nichols', 'webber'] | ","['andrew', 'nichols', 'webber']",4
133,"Late Holocene high precipitation events recorded in lake sediments and catchment geomorphology, Lake Vuoksjavratje, NW Sweden | In this paper, we show the potential of combining multi-proxy analysis of lake sediments with catchment geomorphology to better understand palaeoenvironmental changes. Previous studies have suggested that alpine lakes in N Sweden may be highly sensitive to variations in catchment erosion and precipitation, and that this sensitivity may influence ecologically based reconstructions of past temperature changes. We analysed lake sediments covering the last 5100 years from the alpine Lake Vuoksjavratje in NW Sweden in order to identify different erosional regimes in the lake catchment, sediment sources and lake sedimentary processes, which ultimately affect the palaeoecological record. The measured proxies include elemental geochemistry from XRF core scanning, grain size, sediment accumulation rates, fraction of terrestrial organic carbon and geomorphological mapping, supported by previously published chironomid and total organic carbon data. From the integrated results we identified time intervals when increased intensity of precipitation altered sedimentation and lake catchment erosional processes. The most prominent event occurred c. 2900 cal. a BP and is interpreted to be the result of excessive precipitation, possibly related to the climatic shift towards cooler and wetter conditions referred to as the 2.8 ka event. | ['berntsson', 'bertrand', 'de', 'vleeschouwer', 'jansson', 'kylander'] | ","['berntsson', 'bertrand', 'de', 'vleeschouwer', 'jansson', 'kylander']",2
134,"Late Quaternary Chronology and Environments of Square Lake Torngat Mountains Labrador Newfoundland Quebec Canada | Sediment, pollen, and diatom records from Square Lake, a small lake dammed by a segment of Saglek Moraine, cover the period of deposition of and deglaciation from the Saglak Moraine. The basal radiocarbon date (18210 .+-. 1900 years BP) is on sediment contaminated by reworked pollen and is thus a maximum age. However, the date was measured on organic carbon recovered from glaciolacustrine couplets associated with deposition of the Saglek Moraine and thus establishes a Late Wisconsinan age for the Saglek Moraine. Vegetation on the ice-free upland surrounding Square Lake at this time was a sparse tundra vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs. The absence of diatoms indicates perennial lake-ice cover. A major transition is recorded by pollen and diatoms at >8.5 ka. Vegetation probably remained sparse tundra, but birch and willow may have arrived in the area by 8 ka. Diatoms are first dominated by alkaliphil species, reflecting continued influence of glaciolacustrine sedimentation. An abrupt change in depositional environment .gtoreq.8 ka indicates ice retreat from the Saglek Moraine and start of nonglacial lacustrine sedimentation that has continued to the present. This was accompanied by an increase in organic matter, reflecting the newly established rich shrub tundra. At this time the diatoms also change, suggesting development of acidic organic soils around the lake. At 7.5 ka, diatoms indicate continued evolution of water chemistry and nutrient availabilty in the lake. Diatom concentrations and transfer function analyses of the pollen record identify the Holocene climatic optimum at 6.5 ka in the southern Torngat Mountains. The modern diatom flora was established at that time, but a decrease in diatom concentrations and estimated July temperatures suggest climatic deterioration in the area since 6.5 ka. | ['andrew', 'clark', 'short', 'williams'] | ","['andrew', 'clark', 'short', 'williams']",2
135,"The late Quaternary development of three ancient tarns on southwestern Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, Arctic Canada: Paleolimnological evidence from diatoms and sediment chemistry | Sediment diatom and chemical analyses of cores from three poorly buffered extra-glacial lakes on the northeastern margin of the Canadian Shield (Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island) record interactions between aquatic and terrestrial spheres that were influenced by late Quaternary climatic conditions. Although differences exist between each of the lakes, notably with regards to the intensity of pre-Holocene catchment erosion and the timing of the onset of organic sedimentation, an underlying pattern of lake ontogeny, common to all three lakes, is identified. Although intensified watershed erosion characterized the Late Wisconsinan and Neoglacial cold periods, the lakes nonetheless remained viable ecosystems at these times. Sudden catchment stabilization during the late-glacial to earliest Holocene is associated with incipient organic sedimentation. Lake-water pH increased at this time, likely in response both longer base cation residence times as lake flushing rates decreased, and enhanced alkalinity production from sediment biogeochemical reactions. Subsequently, as the catchments remained stable during the productive early Holocene (c. 9-7 ka BP), then gradually received a renewed increase of minerogenic sedimentation, the breakdown of sources of lake alkalinity resulted in natural acidification. Burial of cation-rich mineral sediments and the loss of permanent sedimentary sinks for the products of microbial reduction likely impeded within-lake alkalinity production, and catchment-derived base cations appeared ineffective in curtailing pH declines. The general nature of the Holocene development of these lakes is similar to that observed elsewhere on crystalline terrains, following deglaciation. Our data therefore suggest that catchment glaciation is not a necessary precursor for models of lake development characterized by initial base cation enrichment and subsequent gradual acidification. ¬© 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers. | ['h√§ftling', 'wolfe'] | ","['h√§ftling', 'wolfe']",2
136,"Late Quaternary diatom and chemical profiles from a meromictic lake in Quebec, Canada | An investigation of the chemistry and diatoms in the sediments of a small hardwater meromictic lake in Quebec indicated remains of both freshwater and brackish (halophilic) water diatoms in the organic sediments laid down after the lake was isolated by isostatic rebound from the Champlain Sea, ‚àº11,000 yr. ago. Water in deeper strata of the lake evidently was not completely fresh, giving rise to ectogenic meromixis. The loss of marine salts from the lake is believed to have taken 3000 yr. or so and that as this happened, salts of biological origin gradually accumulated in the monimolimnion so that maintenance of meromixis became biogenic. The sediment chemistry reflects primary successional changes in the vegetation of the area rather than a decline of ectogenic meromixis. As forest cover developed and soils stabilised on the rebounding land, erosional processes gave way to leaching processes as the source of nutrients to the lake. The appearance of eutrophic indicator diatoms, and an increased flux of nutrients to the sediments, suggest that a cycle of eutrophication occurred in the lake following the decline of hemlock, ‚àº4800 yr. ago. The recent sediments show an increase in concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb as a result of anthropogenic activities. ¬© 1984. | ['dickman', 'jones', 'mott', 'ouellet'] | ","['dickman', 'jones', 'mott', 'ouellet']",2
137,"A late Quaternary record of eolian silt deposition in a maar lake, St. Michael Island, western Alaska | Recent stratigraphic studies in central Alaska have yielded the unexpected finding that there is little evidence for full-glacial (late Wisconsin) loess deposition. Because the loess record of western Alaska is poorly exposed and not well known, we analyzed a core from Zagoskin Lake, a maar lake on St. Michael Island, to determine if a full-glacial eolian record could be found in that region. Particle size and geochemical data indicate that the mineral fraction of the lake sediments is not derived from the local basalt and is probably eolian. Silt deposition took place from at least the latter part of the mid-Wisconsin interstadial period through the Holocene, based on radiocarbon dating. Based on the locations of likely loess sources, eolian silt in western Alaska was probably deflated by northeasterly winds from glaciofluvial sediments. If last-glacial winds that deposited loess were indeed from the northeast, this reconstruction is in conflict with a model-derived reconstruction of paleowinds in Alaska. Mass accumulation rates in Zagoskin Lake were higher during the Pleistocene than during the Holocene. In addition, more eolian sediment is recorded in the lake sediments than as loess on the adjacent landscape. The thinner loess record on land may be due to the sparse, herb tundra vegetation that dominated the landscape in full-glacial time. Herb tundra would have been an inefficient loess trap compared to forest or even shrub tundra due to its low roughness height. The lack of abundant, full-glacial, eolian silt deposition in the loess stratigraphic record of central Alaska may be due, therefore, to a mimimal ability of the landscape to trap loess, rather than a lack of available eolian sediment. | ['ager', 'bradbury', 'dean', 'muhs'] | ","['ager', 'bradbury', 'dean', 'muhs']",1
138,"Late Quaternary glaciation in the Northern Ogilvie Mountains: revised correlations and implications for the stratigraphic record | New geomorphic, paleolimnological, and radiocarbon data suggest that a terminal moraine complex in the Northern Ogilvie Mountains, Yukon Territory, Canada, may represent the McConnell Glaciation (Late Wisconsinan), rather than the Reid Glaciation (marine isotope Stage 8; Illinoian) as previously thought. Relict fluvial channels on the surface of the moraine and analysis of a suite of lake sediment cores from Chapman Lake, a closed-basin kettle on the surface of the moraine, suggest that flow from the Blackstone River passed over the moraine and through the lake until ca. 12 500 BP, at which time the Blackstone River was captured by the East Blackstone River, diverting flow from the lake. Subsequent incision by the Blackstone River has left its base level more than 10 m below the level of Chapman Lake. Perched former outlets from Chapman Lake indicate that this incision must postdate stream capture. Because the Chapman Lake moraine is a topographic barrier across the Blackstone River valley, incision must have occurred shortly after deposition of the moraine, suggesting that the landscape surrounding Chapman Lake is substantially younger than previously thought. Additional radiocarbon dates also suggest that kettle subsidence at Chapman Lake was ongoing during the early Holocene and that North Fork Pass moraine, 15 km upvalley from the Chapman Lake moraine, may have been formed during the Late Glacial rather than the McConnell Glaciation. | ['beierle'] | ",['beierle'],4

Eighteen new radiocarbon dates provide chronological control, superseding earlier results. Spuriously old dates were obtained from both sandy peats and low-organic lake sediments. The most reliable dates were from marine shells and foraminifera. They indicate that deglaciation was underway by 9000 BP rather than 16,000 BP. Over the period of the record, the local environment was characterized by a high arctic pollen assemblage dominated by grass, sedge, and willow; a middle Holocene warm period is indicated by increased willow, herb, and moss values. Sea-ice conditions were severe enough to inhibit the growth of diatoms until ca. 6300 BP and ice proximal and deglacial conditions prevailed in the fiords until ca. 6000 BP. Diatom productivity increased between 3000 BP and 2500 BP, suggesting warmer surface waters and less sea ice. After 2000 BP diatom accumulation decreased sharply, due to a cooling of climate. The foraminifera indicate a major change in bottom water conditions ca. 4000 BP as the benthic species shift from a calcareous to an arenaceous assemblage. | ['andrew', 'elia', 'short', 'weiner', 'williams'] | ","['andrew', 'elia', 'short', 'weiner', 'williams']",4

Combined with sediment textural analysis, the record demonstrates local changes in hydrology, mound formation, and vegetation succession in response to landscape processes.

These zones are characterized by stable composition of spore-pollen spectra and belong to Zyryan (Early Visconcene) and Sartan (Late Visconcene) intervals. EL3 zone located between two grassy pollen zones reflects the vegetation change during Kargin (Middle Visconcene) interval. The change of grassy tundra communities by the large shrub tundra and deciduous forests (EL4 zone) is dated by 12,5 thousand years.

143,"Late Quaternary Pollen Transport Processes, Western North-Atlantic - Data from Box Models, Cross-Margin and N-S Transects | Surface pollen assemblages in coastal and neritic sediments of the western North Atlantic compare well with eastern North American vegetation zones, and late Quaternary pollen in marginal marine sediments clearly correlate with changes in terrestrial vegetation and paleoclimates. In contrast, offshore assemblages are strongly affected by differential adaptation of pollen to long distance transport by wind and water. Marine pollen transport processes were studied by measuring air and water inputs to a coast-shelf box model, and by study of surface samples from cross-margin transects in three different climatic and oceanographic regions at approximately 38-degrees, 45-degrees and 55-degrees-N latitude. The box model shows that aerial transport is the main process by which pollen moves across the continental margin off Nova Scotia. Two clear seabed distribution patterns were found: Betula, Quercus, and herb pollen decrease rapidly offshore in abundance (grains per cubic centimetre) and in relative abundance (percentage); Pinus and Picea have abundance peaks on the continental margin, but percentages increase further offshore. Distributions of the main pollen and spore taxa were compared for late Wisconsinan glacial (oxygen isotopic stage 2, 12-28 ka), terminal Pleistocene (10-12 ka) and Holocene sediments at 5 continental margin and 3 deep-sea sites. The largest changes were found in percentages of Pinus, Picea, and herb pollen during the late Wisconsinan glacial and terminal Pleistocene intervals at subpolar latitudes. These data can be related to shifts in paleo-vegetation, -winds and -hydrology that accompany global climate change. | ['mccarthy', 'mudie'] | ","['mccarthy', 'mudie']",0
144,"Late Holocene relative sea-level changes and the earthquake deformation cycle around upper Cook Inlet, Alaska | Multiple peat-silt couplets preserved in tidal marsh sediment sequences suggest that numerous great plate boundary earthquakes caused the coast around Cook Inlet, Alaska, to subside over the past 3500 years. Field and laboratory analyses of the two youngest couplets record the well-documented earthquake of AD 1964 and the penultimate one, approximately 850cal yr BP. Diatom assemblages from a range of modern day estuarine environments from tidal flat through salt marsh to acidic bog produce quantitative diatom transfer function models for elevation reconstructions based on fossil samples. Only nine out of 124 fossil assemblages analysed, including previously published data for the AD 1964 earthquake, have a poor modern analogue. Calibration of fossil samples indicate co-seismic subsidence of 1.50 +/- 0.32m for AD 1964, similar to measurements taken after the earthquake, and 1.45 +/- 0.34m for the similar to 850 cal yr BP earthquake. Elevation standard errors for individual fossil samples range from similar to 0.08m in peat layers to similar to 0.35m in silt units. Lack of a chronology within fossil silt units prevents identification of changes in the rate of recovery and land uplift between the post-seismic and inter-seismic periods. However, preservation of multiple peat-silt couplets indicates no net emergence over multiple earthquake cycles. Glacio-isostatic movements from Little Ice Age glacier advance and retreat explains a similar to 0.15m relative sea-level oscillation recorded within the peat layer subsequently submerged as a result of the AD 1964 earthquake. Before both this and the similar to 850 cal yr BP earthquake, diatom assemblages suggest pre-seismic relative sea-level rise of similar to 0.12 +/- 0.13m, representing possible precursors to great earthquakes.

Until now, however, there has been no study from the inner Lena River Delta with a focus on diatoms. The objective of this study was to investigate how the diatom community in a thermokarst lake responded to past limnogeological changes and what specific factors drove variations in the diatom assemblage. We analysed fossil diatom species, organic content, grain-size distribution and elemental composition in a sediment core retrieved in 2009 from a shallow thermokarst lake in the Arga Complex, western Lena River Delta. The core contains a 3,000-year record of sediment accumulation. Shifts in the predominantly benthic and epiphytic diatom species composition parallel changes in sediment characteristics. Paleoenvironmental and limnogeological development, inferred from multiple biological and sedimentological variables, are discussed in the context of four diatom zones, and indicate a strong relation between changes in the diatom assemblage and thermokarst processes. We conclude that limnogeological and thermokarst processes such as lake drainage, rather than direct climate forcing, were the main factors that altered the aquatic ecosystem by influencing, for example, habitat availability, hydrochemistry, and water level. | ['biskaborn', 'bolshiyanov', 'diekmann', 'herzschuh', 'savelieva', 'zibulski'] | ","['biskaborn', 'bolshiyanov', 'diekmann', 'herzschuh', 'savelieva', 'zibulski']",2

The analysis of delta sediment radiocarbon ages showed that they could not have formed as peat during floodplain bogging; rather, they accumulated when Laptev Sea water level was high and green mosses and sedges grew and were deposited on the surface of flooded marshes.The Lena River delta formed as organomineral masses and layered sediments accumulated during transgressive phases when sea level rose. In regressive phases, the islands composed of these sediments and other, more ancient islands were eroded. Each new sea transgression led to further accumulation of layered sediments. As a result of alternating transgressive and regressive phases, the first alluvial-marine terrace formed, consisting of geological bodies of different ages. Determining the formation age of different areas of the first terrace and other marine terraces on the coast allowed the periods of increasing (8000-6000 BP (years before present), 4500-4000, 2500-1500, and 400-200 BP) and decreasing (5000, 3000, and 500 BP) Laptev Sea levels to be distinguished in the Lena Delta area. | ['bolshiyanov', 'makarov', 'savelieva'] | ","['bolshiyanov', 'makarov', 'savelieva']",4
148,"Limnological conditions in a subarctic lake (northern Quebec, Canada) during the late Holocene: Analyses based on fossil diatoms | A fossil diatom record covering the past 3000 cal. years BP was analyzed from a small lake in northwestern Quebec near the northern limit of present-day tree-line. Fragilaria virescens var. exigua Grunow in Van Heurck was the dominant species throughout the core with abundances ranging between 13-35% of the total valve count. There was a replacement of alkaliphilous taxa by acidophilous taxa beginning ca. 1300 cal. yr ago, probably reflecting long-term, natural acidification processes. A diatom-based transfer function was used to provide quantitative estimates of variations in lakewater dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These inferred values showed that DOC concentrations have remained stable over the past 3000 years (mean +- S.D. = 5 +- 0.43 mg C l-1), suggesting relatively constant allochthonous carbon inputs and underwater light conditions during the late Holocene. The reconstructed DOC data were compared to the palynological record from the same lake. Our study indicates that, in contrast to paleolimnological records from lakes in central and western Canada, climatic variations and associated vegetational shifts have been too subtle to cause pronounced variations in DOC in this northern Quebec site. | ['gajewski', 'pienitz', 'ponader', 'vincent'] | ","['gajewski', 'pienitz', 'ponader', 'vincent']",4
149,"Lithology and Late Postglacial Stratigraphy of Bottom Sediments in Isolated Basins of the White Sea Coast Exemplified by a Small Lake in the Chupa Settlement Area (Northern Karelia) | The complex lithological, geochemical, geochronological, and micropaleontological (diatoms, spores, pollen) investigations of stratified bottom sediments that constitute facies-variable sedimentary sequences in a small isolated lake located near the upper limit of the sea on the White Sea coast made it possible to define lithostratigraphic units (LSU) forming the complete sedimentary succession in deep parts of isolated basins. It is shown that stratigraphy of heterogeneous sequences is determined by two regional transgressive-regressive cycles in relative sea level fluctuations: alternating late Glacial and Holocene transgressions and regressions. The lower part of a clastogenic clayey-sandy-silty sequence successively composed of freshwater (LSU 1) and brackish-water (LSU 2) sediments of the ice-marginal basins and marine postglacial facies (LSU 3) was formed during the late Glacial glacioeustatic marine transgression. Its upper part formed in different isolated basins at different stages of the Holocene is represented depending on its altimetric position on the coastal slope by costal marine sediments (LSU 4) and facies of the partly isolated inlet (LSU 5). The organogenic sapropelic sequence, which overlies sediments of the marine basin and partly isolated bay, corresponds to lithostratigraphic units represented by Holocene sediments accumulated in the meromictic lake (LSU 6), onshore freshwater basin (LSU 7), and freshwater basin with elevated water mineralization (LSU 8) deposited during maximum development of Holocene transgression and lacustrine sediments (LSU 9) formed in coastal environments during terminal phases of the Holocene. The defined lithostratigraphic units differ from each other in lithological, micropaleontological, and geochemical features reflected in structural and textural properties of their sediments, their composition, inclusions, and composition of paleophytocoenoses and diatom assemblages. | ['kolka', 'korsakova', 'lavrova', 'shelekhova', 'tolstobrov', 'tolstobrova'] | ","['kolka', 'korsakova', 'lavrova', 'shelekhova', 'tolstobrov', 'tolstobrova']",2
150,"Living at the margin of the retreating Fennoscandian Ice Sheet: The early Mesolithic sites at Aareavaara, northernmost Sweden | During an archaeological survey in Pajala parish, northernmost Sweden, clusters of quartz waste from knapping and burnt bone were discovered on a glaciofluvial gravel plateau close to Aareavaara village in the Muonio River valley. Sampled materials from a larger area and small-scale excavations (in total 6 m(2)) are interpreted as resulting from short-stay hunter-gatherer camps. Radiocarbon dating on burnt bones suggest an age of occupancy at similar to 10,700 cal. yr BP, which is more or less contemporary with 'Komsa Phase' sites on the north coast of Norway (similar to 300-360 km northwards). The Aareavaara site should thus be the oldest known archaeological site to date in northern Sweden. A palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, based on pollen analysis of sediment cores from two nearby lakes and radiocarbon dating of macrofossils for construction of time/depth sedimentation curves, suggests a deglaciation age of the area corresponding to occupation by early man (similar to 10,700 cal. yr BP). Aareavaara was at the time of deglaciation situated in a transitional zone between subaqueous and subaerial ice-margin retreat from the northeast towards the southwest, with higher hills and plateaux forming an archipelago in the Ancylus Lake with highest shorelines formed at similar to 170 m a.s.l. The hunter-gatherer camp sites at Aareavaara were thus, both in time and space, located in close proximity to the retreating ice sheet margin, but also in a waterfront location, in fact on an island in the Ancylus Lake. Our pollen data suggest a subarctic birch woodland tundra landscape characterized by open vegetation, including occasional birch trees and an abundance of willow and dwarf birch. | ['barnekow', 'moller', 'ostlund', 'palmbo', 'sandgren', 'willerslev'] | ","['barnekow', 'moller', 'ostlund', 'palmbo', 'sandgren', 'willerslev']",1

153,"Long-term stability of cladoceran assemblages in small, shallow, Canadian Shield lakes experiencing marked calcium declines | A greater appreciation of biotic responses to environmental changes is warranted in small, shallow lakes because of the high number of these habitats, and their unique contributions to regional biodiversity. Furthermore, recent water chemistry monitoring data show that shallow lakes in Ontario are sensitive and have responded significantly to environmental stressors such as acid deposition and lake water calcium decline. Here, we use paleoecological techniques to examine cladoceran assemblages in modern and pre-industrial sediments of 30 shallow lakes to determine the key environmental gradients that influence present-day assemblages, and to assess how assemblage structure has changed since pre-industrial times (pre-1850s). Redundancy analysis of present-day cladoceran assemblages and key environmental variables identified lake surface area and Secchi depth as significant predictors of assemblage composition. In our data set, Secchi depth was not correlated to water clarity but rather to macrophyte cover, suggesting that cladoceran assemblages were highly influenced by habitat structure. In contrast to nearby, deeper lakes, where pelagic cladoceran taxa have changed significantly in relative abundance over time, cladoceran assemblages in present-day and pre-industrial sediments of shallow lakes did not differ significantly in composition. While the specific reasons for this muted response are unknown, we hypothesize that: (1) littoral taxa may be less sensitive to low Ca concentrations, or ecological thresholds have not yet been crossed or are lower for littoral taxa; (2) calcium availability may vary spatially within shallow lakes, and this is not captured in a single measure of water chemistry from the centre of the lake; and/or (3) habitat structure is more important than water chemistry as a predictor of assemblage composition in these study lakes, and this has not changed significantly over time. | ['desellas', 'kurek', 'mosscrop', 'paterson', 'smol', 'weeber'] | ","['desellas', 'kurek', 'mosscrop', 'paterson', 'smol', 'weeber']",4
154,"Long-term stability of permafrost in subarctic peat plateaus, west-central Canada | Long-term vegetation succession and permafrost dynamics in subarctic peat plateaus of west-central Canada have been studied through detailed plant macrofossil analysis and extensive AMS radiocarbon dating of two peat profiles. Peatland inception at these sites occurred around 5800-5100 yr BP (6600-5900 cal. BP) as a result of paludification of upland forests. At the northern peat plateau site, located in the continuous permafrost zone, palaeobotanical evidence suggests that permafrost was already present under the forested upland prior to peatland development. Paludification was initiated by permafrost collapse, but re-aggradation of permafrost occurred soon after peatland inception. At the southern site, located in the discontinuous permafrost zone, the aggradation of permafrost occurred soon after peatland inception. In the peat plateaus, permafrost conditions have remained very stable until present. Sphagnum fuscum-dominated stages have alternated with more xerophytic communities characterized by ericaceous shrubs. Local peat fires have occurred, but most of these did not cause degradation of the permafrost. Starting from 2800-1100 yr BP (2900-1000 cal. BP) consistently dry surface conditions have prevailed, possibly related to continued frost heave or nearby polygon crack formation. | ['kuhry', 'sannel'] | ","['kuhry', 'sannel']",0
155,"Macrofossil Analysis of a Peat Section in the Hot Weather Creek Area, Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, Nwt | The onset of peat accumulation in the Hot Weather Creek area (79-degrees-58'N-84-degrees-28'W) followed the postglacial marine emergence of the region. The physiographic context of the studied Holocene deposit suggests that peat initially accumulated in a depression south of early Ridge Lake. Polygons subsequently formed in that peat deposit. The draining of the lake took place as a result of downcutting of the deposit by the lake spillway. At the base of the 2.85 m sequence, macrofossil analysis reveals an open meadow dominated by grasses and sedges recording a pioneer stage that followed emersion. The physionomy of this meadow was subsequently modified by the formation of a low-centred polygon. Bryophytes colonized the resulting wet depression and a peat deposit developed. A series of mineral horizons occur throughout the deposit, indicating recurrent aeolian or alluvial activity during peat accumulation. These layers are associated with higher rates of peat decomposition. | ['garneau'] | ",['garneau'],2
156,"Magneto-Mineralogical and Biological Properties of Sediments of the Lake Bolshoy Kharbey | Investigation of sediment cores from the lake Bolshoy Kharbey (Bolshezemelskaya tundra) was performed using magnetic-mineralogical and palaeobiological methods, including palynological, Cladocera and chironomid analysis. It was shown that noticeable changes took place in the state of sediments and communities of hydrobionts. Lower part of the sediments is characterized by lower ferromagnetic component, which is related to lower number of magnetotactic bacteria, producing biologically controlled magnetic minerals. Upper part of the core is characterized by higher values of magnetic susceptibility and its components. Pollen analysis has shown that vegetation of the region during the time of the investigated sedimentation was dominated by conifers and by constant presence of dwarf birch, Alnus fruticosa, Ericaceae. Herbaceous are represented mainly by sedge, reflecting local near-water vegetation. Larch pollen disappears gradually from the lake sediments, alongside with the increase of the concentrations of birch and Alnus fruticosa pollen. Taxa characteristic for big water bodies, mainly from the family Bosminidae, dominate Cladoceran communities. The most frequent zooplanktonic taxa in the whole core were Chydorus. cf. sphaericus, Eubosmina cf. longispina, small forms of the genera Alona. Chironomid communities are represented mainly by acid-tolerant, temperate, littoral- sublittoral taxa. In the upper layers of sediments in cladoceran and chironomid communities share of planktonic taxa increases which indicates rise of the lake level as a result of seasonal ground melting. At the same time gradual succession in the local vegetation starts. Concentrations of the birch and larch pollen decrease, and Pinus s/g Diploxylon increase. This can indicate that climate became warmer and drier. Communities of hydrobionts are getting more diverse, the number of the acidophilic, phytophylic taxa and taxa, characteristic for eutrophication grows. In palynospectra concentration of ferns and sphagnum grows, which can indicate swamping, growth of littoral zone and spreading of near water vegetation and reflects warming of climate. | ['fefilova', 'frolova', 'gafiatullina', 'kosareva', 'kuzina', 'loskutova', 'nazarova', 'palagushkina', 'rudaya', 'syrykh', 'tumanov'] | ","['fefilova', 'frolova', 'gafiatullina', 'kosareva', 'kuzina', 'loskutova', 'nazarova', 'palagushkina', 'rudaya', 'syrykh', 'tumanov']",2

One method of doing this is to group the fossils according to the ecological requirements of the taxa that they represent and then compare assemblages on the basis of the percentage of individual insects in each group. Eight such groups are then used to compare fossil assemblages from the Yukon Territory, Alaska and eastern Siberia.

158,"Methods of Ph Calibration of Sedimentary Diatom Remains for Reconstructing History of Ph in Lakes | The pH history of lakes can be inferred from diatom remains in dated sediment cores. To derive transfer functions for pH inference in acidic lakes, diatoms were counted in surface-sediment from 31 soft-water lakes in northern New England (NE, USA), and 36 in Norway (N), covering pH 4.4-7.1. Cluster analysis of each data set indicates that pH 6 is an upper limit for a group of similar diatom assemblages. For each set, multiple linear regressions were developed to relate 3 versions of the diatom data to pH of surface-waters: relative frequencies of selected diatom taxa, the first principal component (1PC) of these frequencies and the frequencies of Hustedt pH groups. Also, simple linear regressions were developed for 2 versions: Index B and Index Alpha, both based on pH groups. Regressions were run separately for lakes with pH .ltoreq. 6; these are most relevant for pH inference in acidic lakes. The best regressions (N: taxa and 1PC taxa) have r2 0.69-0.91 and Se 0.24-0.31 pH units, the worst (NE: log alpha) have r2 0.27-0.57 and Se 0.51. In all cases, errors for NE are greater than N, partly due to greater diversity of NE lakes. Regressions based on pH groups (directly and by indices) have smaller r2 and larger Se than those based on taxa and 1PC taxa. The Index Alpha is least useful because its requirement for alkaline diatom units is unsatisfied at many acidic lakes. Regressions based on taxa may give erratic pH inferences due to sensitivity to unusual frequencies of individual taxa; this effect is reduced by using 1PC taxa. Four regressions based on pH .ltoreq. 6 lakes were used for inferring pH in a 210Pb dated core from Nedre Malmesvatn, N (now pH 4.6). There is good agreement among 3 of the 4 (not for the regression based directly on taxa) that there has been a decrease of .apprx. 0.6 pH units starting in the late 1800's. | ['anderson', 'davis'] | ","['anderson', 'davis']",4

The shells are readily preserved, are abundant in freshwater peatland and lake sediments, and can be identified to the species. Fossil testate amoebae were first discovered in the late 1800s in limnic sediments, but shortly therafter were also found in peat deposits. Though testate amoebae are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, they do not have cosmopolitan habitat preferences. Their most promising role in paleoecology lies in deciphering past hydrological conditions in peatlands.

164,"Molecular composition of raw peat and humic substances from permafrost peat soils of European Northeast Russia as climate change markers | Humic substances (HSs) from themire peat soils of the forest-tundra zone of the European northeast part of Russia have been characterized in terms of molecular composition. This was accomplished using solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) techniques and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The composition depended on the intensity of cryogenic processes in the active layer, the quality of the humification precursors (the degree of peat material transformation), and the biochemical selection of aromatic fragments during humification. Humic acids (HAs) and fulvic acids (FAs) of the peat soils showed the presence of compounds with a low extent of condensation and a low portion of aromatic fragments, which increased with depth. A higher proportion of aliphatic carbon species was found in the HAs, indicating a low degree of organic matter stabilization. Based on the data from the two types of peat soils, we suggest that particular changes in the proportion of aromatic and unoxidized aliphatic fragments on the border of the bottom of the active layer and permafrost layers can be used as markers of current climatic change.

We use established methods and explore new techniques to assess changes in marine influence. Bathymetric and sub-bottom profiles were acquired to examine basin-wide sedimentation and a 5.8 m sediment core spanning the last 7800 cal yr BP was analyzed. We measured magnetic susceptibility, bulk organic matter properties, molecular biomarkers, diatom assemblages, and elemental profiles acquired by scanning X-ray fluorescence. These characteristics of the sediment reflect detailed changes in salinity and water column conditions as the lake was progressively isolated. Three distinct litho/chemo-stratigraphic units represent a restricted marine phase (7800-6500 cal yr BP), a transitional phase characterized by intermittent marine influence (6500-4900 cal yr BP), and complete isolation and freshwater sedimentation (4900 cal yr BP to present). Although there are uncertainties in the estimate of the threshold elevation of the lake, the timing of these phases generally corresponds with previous interpretations of the local relative sea-level history. This record captures sea-level regression following the Tapes transgression and supports the interpretation of a subsequent sea-level stillstand, dated in Heimerdalsvatnet from 6500 to 4900 cal yr BP.

Core 04-SVID-03 represents a similar to 12,000 cal. yrs BP to present record. Large magnitude changes in delta O-18 occurred during the Holocene at the site. Downcore shifts in delta O-18 of chironomids did not correlate with measurements of the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of chironomid head capsules, implying that the delta O-18 changes were not primarily driven by changes in chironomid diet during the Holocene. The delta D of TOM provided a proxy of relative lake-water delta D changes at the site and also showed large magnitude changes during the record. This approach was supported by analyses of a modern training set where delta D-TOM analyses were conducted using surface sediments from a suite of freshwater lakes over a large latitudinal gradient. The magnitude of changes in both the delta O-18 and delta D and the relatively negative delta O-18 values throughout much of the core suggest that the proxies represent more paleoenvironmental information than solely temperature.

Pollen of oak, linden, and hornbeam has been found in surface samples taken within the natural ranges of these species and in regions of their introduction, with linden and oak pollen being transferred by air for several tens of kilometers, and hornbeam pollen, for about 200 km. Beech pollen can be transferred by wind for long distances, and its presence in spectra has been recorded farther than 1000 km from the species range boundaries. The proportion of components transferred from long distances increases in spore-pollen spectra from regions with sparse or poorly developed plant cover, and single occurrences of broadleaf tree pollen are also possible in such regions. | ['kusilman', 'mazei', 'novenko'] | ","['kusilman', 'mazei', 'novenko']",2
171,"Old organic matter inside glacial deposits in Finland: sedimentation models | Deposits containing old organic matter are reviewed over the whole area of their occurrence in Finland in an attempt to explain the sedimentary environments which created the stratigraphy at the sites concerned and to evaluate the findings with respect to the vegetational and climatic history of non-glacial intervals and to the dating of such horizons in the Quaternary stratigraphy. The following sedimentation models are proposed to explain these deposits: 1) They may be in primary position in the stratigraphy. 2) Basal regelation in the inner parts of the ice sheet may have lifted layers of organic matter into the ice, causing them to be transported. These layers will have been deposited later together with glacial sediments. 3) Glaciofluvial deposits may have been generated in a subglacial tunnel. Silt and organic matter, having been eroded from the same meltwater channel beneath the inner parts of the ice sheet, may then have been transported and deposited at the same point. 4) Organic matter could also have fallen into a subglacial water body from the ice after englacial transport. -from Author | ['punkari'] | ",['punkari'],0
172,"Palaeoclimate interpretation of stable isotope data from lake sediment archives | The isotope composition of authigenic and biogenic carbonates and diatom silica are commonly used as palaeoclimate proxies from lake sediments. This article reviews the controls on the isotope composition of lacustrine skeletal and non-skeletal deposits and illustrates how stable isotope Studies contribute to an understanding of changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, evaporation and the carbon cycle. It highlights the differences in the palaeoclimate potential of a wide range of lakes ranging from open to closed lake basins. A large number of the case historics, but not all, are drawn from studies of temperate lakes from Europe. Large closed lake systems, in the tropics and elsewhere, lose water predominantly through evaporation, and contain sediments with variable and generally high delta(18)O values. Fluctuations in the isotope composition of authigenic or biogenic minerals are mainly a function of long-term changes in the precipitation/evaporation ratio. In contrast small open lakes which have a degree of through-flow typically contain sediments with delta(18)O values that vary by no more than a few parts per thousand. These variations are generally ascribed to variations in temperature or the isotope composition of precipitation (deltap), from which either an annual or seasonally specific signal can be gained. These types of lakes are common in Northern Europe and at high altitudes. The interpretation of isotope data from a lacustrine succession requires a knowledge of the local processes that might control and modify the signal. Their effects need to be quantified, and a robust calibration using the modern lake system is necessary to establish the relationship between the measured signal, the isotopic composition of the host waters, and climate.

173,"Palaeoecological studies of Holocene lake sediments from west Greenland | Colonisation by plants and animals and subsequent biotic development in west Greenland was studied by analyses of macrofossils in four Holocene lake sequences. One of the lake basins, located near the outer coast, was deglaciated shortly after the transition from the last glacial stage to the Holocene, and a basal date of 12,100-11,300 cal. years BP was obtained. Two of the lake basins located near the margin of the Greenland ice sheet were deglaciated several millennia later. The oldest sediments contain low-diversity floras and faunas. Some of the first immigrants were Chironomidae and Daphnia pulex, soon followed by other insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates. Water mosses, Ranunculus confervoides, Hippuris vulgaris and Potamogeton filiformis were among the first plants that colonised the lakes. The earliest Holocene terrestrial flora in west Greenland was probably entirely herbaceous, with Salix herbacea and Empetrum nigrum being some of the first woody plants to arrive. A number of invertebrates are new to the fossil fauna of Greenland, and the ostracod Ilyocypris bradyi that was found in one sequence, from 7000 to 6500 cal. years BP, has not been recorded from Greenland before. | ['bennike'] | ",['bennike'],4

The record spans the last 8,200 cal. years and was radiocarbon dated and analysed for macroscopic remains of plants and animals. The record extends the known history of several invertebrate species back in time, and provides minimum ages for their immigration to Greenland after the last deglaciation. Shells of the ostracod Ilyocypris bradyi were found in sediments dated to the time interval c. 7,000-6,500 cal. years BP. Shells of this species were found previously in a nearby oligosaline lake, where its occurrence was dated to about the same short time interval. The species is a thermophilous, non-arctic taxon that is absent from the present day Greenland fauna, and we suggest that its former occurrence in west Greenland marks the peak of the Holocene thermal maximum. This is in agreement with other records from Greenland. | ['anderson', 'bennike', 'mcgowan'] | ","['anderson', 'bennike', 'mcgowan']",1
175,"Palaeoecology of Sphagnum riparium (Angstrom) in Northern Hemisphere peatlands: Implications for peatland conservation and palaeoecological research | Sphagnum riparium (Angstrom) is a rare constituent of modern peatland plant communities and is also very rarely found as a subfossil in peat archives. We present new data on the occurrence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in three Northern Hemisphere peatlands from Yellowknife (NW Canada), Abisko (N Sweden), and the Northern Ural Mountains (NW Russia). Sphagnum riparium macrofossils were present in transitional phases between rich fen and oligotrophic bog. Sphagnum riparium was a dominant species in the three sites and was found in combination with Sphagnum angustifolium, Drepanocladus sp., and vascular plants including Andromeda polifolia, Chamedaphne calyculata and Oxycoccus palustris. Testate amoebae indicate that the species occurred in wet to moderately wet conditions (water-table depth inferred from a testate amoeba transfer function model ranged between 25 and 0 cm under the peatland surface). The wet-indicator taxa Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the testate amoeba communities in peat horizons containing Sphagnum riparium. The presence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in peat profiles in the Northern Hemisphere can be interpreted as an indication of wet minerotrophic conditions, often corresponding to a rise in water-level and establishment of a wet habitat. Sphagnum riparium is a transient species in these peatlands and is replaced by communities dominated by more acidophilic species such as Sphagnum angustifolium, Sphagnum russowii, and Sphagnum fuscum. Our data show that although Sphagnum riparium is a transient peat-forming species, it is widespread in sub-arctic and boreal environments. The subfossil occurrence of Sphagnum riparium in the Northern Hemisphere may indicate that its range has increased during the Late Holocene. The conservation of Sphagnum riparium in peatlands depends on the existence of relatively short-lived transitional communities which potentially can be artificially created. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Myvatn I was deeper than the present Myvatn but similar in size. Tephrochronology confirms an equal age of the Ytrifloi and Sydrifloi basins of the present Myvatn. Diatom succession in the sediment of the Sydrifloi basin was divided into 4 zones, of which the lowest corresponds to inherited and highly disturbed Myvatn I sediment. At 90 cm depth, i.e., .apprx. 1600 AD, in the Sydrifloi sediment a simultaneous increase occurred in Cladophora aegagropila (Chlorophyta), Eurycercus lamellatus (Cladocera) and 3 diatom species epiphytic on Cladophora. The density of Cladocera also followed this trend. The increase in Cladophora was perhaps caused by improved light conditions on the bottom, either because of a decrease in water depth due to sedimentation or a decrease in Anabaena blooms or both. | ['einarsson'] | ",['einarsson'],2
178,"Paleo Phycology of a High Arctic Lake near Cape Herschel Ellesmere Island Canada | Fifty-five diatom taxa, representing mostly acidophilous and benthic species were identified in a 56 cm long core from a small, deep lake (78.degree.29.5' North, 76.degree.44.3' West) in innermost Baird Inlet, Ellesmere Island, Arctic Canada. The size and composition of past algal populations appears to have been controlled by fluctuations in the extent of icefree conditions in the littoral zone. The development of planktonic diatoms may have been precluded by extended ice cover in the pelagic region, although planktonic chrysophytes (exclusive of the Synuraceae) were abundant throughout the lake's 9000 yr history. Crysophycean success in this harsh environment is attributed to their versatile nutritional strategies, their motility, and their ability of form a good resting stage. Four fossil zones were delineated. Following the onset of organic sedimentation (.apprx. 9000 yr BP), the diatom flora was dominated by small Fragilaria species (zone 1), comparable to early postglacial communities from temperate lakes. A contemporary analog to this early assemblage was recorded in the surficial sediments of Proteus Lake (78.degree.41.7' North 74.degree.23.0' West), on Pim Island, suggesting that these diatoms reflect slightly alkaline conditions and extended ice cover. As the climate warmed, the assemblage shifted to one dominated by Nitzschia bryophila and Pinnularia biceps (zone 2), followed by an increase in Navicula variostriata (zone 3), indicating that ice cover was at a minimum and that bryophytes were abundant. Climatic deterioration (.apprx. 4000 ys BP) coincided with a shift to a diverse assemblage of shallow water diatoms and a marked decline in chrysophyte and diatom populations (zone 4). In arctic regions, diatoms may provide indirect information of past climates, since temperature is closely associated with habitat availability. | ['smol'] | ",['smol'],2
179,"Paleoclimate changes inferred from stable isotopes and magnetic properties of organic-rich lake sediments in Arctic Norway | Stable isotope measures in organic matter are frequently used as indicators of past climate change. Although such analyses can provide valuable information, there is considerable uncertainty associated with studies of organic-rich sediments, especially those from Arctic lakes and bogs. We studied stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and magnetic properties in a sediment core from a small alkaline lake with a high sedimentation rate, Lake Nattmalsvatn, Norway. There is good correspondence among the different sediment variables during the late glacial, and they seemingly reflect major climate variations such as the Allerod Interstade and the Younger Dryas, as well as the transition into the current interglacial. During the early Holocene, however, these relationships are more complex and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values do not stabilize until similar to 7,500 cal year BP. A significant excursion in all variables occurs between 6,850 and 6,500 cal year BP and is interpreted to represent climate deterioration. Holocene delta C-13 values vary little and indicate that isotopically-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake, possibly influenced by methanotrophy and high pCO(2), dominated the lake's carbon cycle. Holocene delta N-15 is similarly muted, likely due to the availability of abundant dissolved nitrogen. Bulk organic matter is probably dominated by phytoplankton remains produced beneath the ice cover in late spring and during ice breakup when isotopically-depleted DIC, pCO(2) and ammonium availability were maximal. Thus, use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 as indicators of Holocene paleoclimate and paleoproductivity variation can be challenging in a lake such as Nattmalsvatn, where ice cover isolates the basin for large parts of the year, allowing dissolved respiratory gases to accumulate in the water column. In contrast, magnetic variables appear to better track climate variations. In particular, runoff-driven influx of minerogenic sediments shows high variability that can be attributed to regional changes in Holocene winter precipitation. The most striking shifts occur between 4,000 and 2,300 cal year BP. | ['janbu', 'paasche', 'talbot'] | ","['janbu', 'paasche', 'talbot']",4

182,"Holocene paleoecology of a wild rice (Zizania sp.) lake in Northwestern Ontario, Canada | Whitefish Lake is a large (11-km-long), shallow, basin in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The presence of extensive stands of wild rice (Zizania sp.) in combination with high archaeological site density suggests that this lake was ecologically important to regional precontact populations. Collection and analysis of sediment from Whitefish Lake was initiated in 2008 in order to reconstruct changes in lake depth, climate, and vegetation throughout the Holocene. In general, the upper 4.5 m of basinal sediment is composed of similar to 1.5+ m of varves, which is overlain by a 1.5-m-thick unit with ped-like structures, and similar to 1.5 m of lacustrine sediment. This sequence documents an early proglacial lake phase, followed by a dry interval before 4,300 (4,900 cal) BP when the lake was significantly shallower, and the establishment of the modern lake during the late Holocene. Plant microfossil (phytolith) evidence indicates that wild rice had colonized the basin similar to 5,300 (6,100 cal) BP as the lake level rose in response to climate change. Beginning similar to 4,000 (4,500 cal) BP, changes in elemental data suggest a sharp increase in lake productivity and a switch to anaerobic depositional conditions as the rate of organic sedimentation increased. Recent archaeological research confirms that wild rice was locally processed and consumed during the Middle and Late Woodland periods (similar to 300 BC-AD 1700) although it was evidently growing in the lake well before this time. | ['boyd', 'hamilton', 'surette', 'surette', 'therriault'] | ","['boyd', 'hamilton', 'surette', 'surette', 'therriault']",4

184,"Paleoenvironmental analyses of an organic deposit from an erosional landscape remnant, Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska | The dominant landscape process on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska is the formation and drainage of thaw lakes. Lakes and drained thaw-lake basins account for approximately 75% of the modem surface expression of the Barrow Peninsula. The thaw-lake cycle usually obliterates lacustrine or peat sediments from previous cycles, which could otherwise be used for paleoecological reconstruction of long-term landscape and vegetation changes. Several possible erosional remnants of a former topographic surface that predates the formation of the thaw lakes have been tentatively identified. These remnants are characterized by a higher elevation, a thick organic layer with very high ground ice content in the upper permafrost and a plant community somewhat atypical of the region. Ten soil cores were collected from one site, and one core was intensively sampled for soil organic carbon content, pollen analysis and 14C dating. The lowest level of the organic sediments represents the earliest phase of plant growth and dates to ca. 9000 cal BP. Palynological, evidence indicates the presence of mesic shrub tundra (including sedge, birch, willow and heath vegetation), and microfossil indicators point to wetter eutrophic conditions during this period. Carbon accumulation was rapid due to high net primary productivity in a relatively nutrient-rich environment. These results are interpreted as the local response to ameliorating climate during the early Holocene. The middle Holocene portion of the record contains an unconformity, indicating that between 8200 and 4200 cal BP sediments were eroded from the site, presumably in response to wind activity during a drier period centered around 4500 cal BP. The modem vegetation community of the erosional remnant was established after 4200 cal BP and peat growth resumed. During the late Holocene, carbon accumulation rates (CARs) were greatly reduced in response to the combined effects of declining productivity associated with climatic cooling, and increased nutrient stress as paludification and permafrost aggradation sequestered mineral nutrients.

189,"Paleolimnological assessment of the impact of logging on small boreal lakes | In Finland a great number of forest lakes are affected by silvicultural practices such as logging. Logging affects water chemistry and thus the ecological state of lakes by causing nutrient loads and increasing erosion and humic substances in water. Water quality assessment requires definition of natural background conditions and ecological status of water bodies. Therefore it is necessary to determine the impact of these practices on aquatic organisms. In the absence of long-term monitoring data, paleolimnological methods provide a powerful tool for determining human-induced changes in lakes. In this study diatom assemblages, diatom-inferred water total phosphorus and total organic carbon, and sediment chemistry were analyzed from the sediments of six lakes with a logged catchment area (11-53%). According to one-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) the diatom communities of three lakes were different before, immediately after and more than 10 years after logging and diatom assemblages in remaining three lakes did not show statistically significant differences between these times. However, all changes were minor, and at present the diatom assemblages and diatom-inferred water chemistry of all the lakes are close to the pre-logging conditions. The minor alterations are probably due to the wide protective zones around the lakes. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

The most apparent taxonomic shift was toward a higher relative abundance of the planktonic Cyclotella stelligera complex and a lower relative abundance of benthic Fragilaria taxa (F. pinnata, F. construens var. venter, F. construens, and F. brevistriata) in the modern versus the older sediments. Diatom assemblage composition in Slipper Lake recorded a marked change in the top 5.0 cm (ca. mid-1800s) of the core with a clear shift to a more planktonic diatom assemblage characterized by higher percentages of the Cyclotella stelligera complex. Possible causative factors, such as recent anthropogenic acidification, nutrient enrichment, or atmospheric deposition of contaminants, do not appear sufficient to explain these species changes. Instead, these recent assemblage shifts are consistent with limnological changes occurring with climatic warming, such as a shorter duration of ice cover, a longer growing season, and/or stronger thermal stratification patterns. | ['priesnitz', 'ruhland', 'smol'] | ","['priesnitz', 'ruhland', 'smol']",0
191,"Using paleolimnology to track the impacts of early Arctic peoples on freshwater ecosystems from southern Baffin Island, Nunavut | Paleolimnological approaches can be used to determine the ways in which past Arctic peoples have affected the ecosystems in which they live, and simultaneously to reconstruct the climate and other aspects of the environment that may have influenced local populations. Here we analyze sediment cores from seven ponds on the south-western coast of Baffin Island, Nunavut, in order to assess the impacts of early Arctic peoples on freshwater ecosystems. Prior to the historic Inuit occupation, the study area was extensively inhabited by Thule culture Inuit (ca 1200-1600 AD) and by an earlier Arctic group, the Dorset culture Palaeo-Eskimos (ca 500 BC-1500 AD) and their predecessors from as early as 2500 BC. The study ponds were selected to cover a gradient of the intensity of human activity in their catchments. The ecological impacts of early hunting societies can be detected using paleolimnology because the butchering of marine mammals released nutrients that eutrophied nearby ponds and left distinct geochemical signals in the sediments. The degree of eutrophication in the small freshwater ponds depended on the length of the occupation, as well as the amount and type of marine mammals taken as primary prey items (eg, whales, walrus, or seals). All sediment cores were AMS C-14 dated to establish their chronologies, and analyzed for diatoms and stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15). Both diatoms and sedimentary delta N-15 have been previously demonstrated to respond sensitively to nutrient enrichment from Inuit whalers. Our delta N-15 and diatom data record nutrient enrichment in lakes surrounded by either long-term Thule or Dorset settlements. The Dorset sites that were the locations of periodic seasonal gatherings did not register any evidence of eutrophication in the nearby ponds, reflecting the shorter, less intensive nature of these occupations. Similarly, nearby control ponds with no evidence of significant human activity in their catchments showed little-to-no changes in delta N-15 profiles and diatom assemblages. Due to slow rates of decomposition, nutrients from butchered marine animal bones continue to influence the freshwater sites into which they drain, as evidenced by higher than typical nutrient and production-related water chemistry variables.

Core AMP-112 from Hakluytvatnet, which is also well dated, is a poor magnetic recorder and cannot be used for geomagnetic reconstruction. Comparison of the HAP-212 PSV record with poorly dated regional records show similar directional features, suggesting that PSV can be used for chronological synchronization. Comparison of the HAP-212 PSV with well dated records similar to 1800 km to the southwest and southeast show that these records are in-phase at millennial timescales, within dating and magnetic uncertainties, indicating that a consistent geomagnetic signal is recorded at these temporal and spatial scales. These findings support the notion that PSV, when optimally recorded, can be used to import chronologies from lower latitudes to the High Arctic, where low organic content, hard water effects, lack of datable material, and other difficulties often preclude more conventional radiocarbon dating.

AMS 14C-dating of aquatic mosses (Drepanocladus exannulatus and Scorpidium scorpioides) revealed that the lowermost 90 cm of the core was deposited during a 1.5-2 ka interval in the early Holocene, before the appearance of Salix arctica which immigrated to N Greenland c. 7 ka BP. Armeria scabra, now extinct in the area, larval cases and apotomes of Apatania zonella, today not known north of c. 77 degree N, and other indices point to a climate warmer than that of today. A thin, sandy layer 13 cm below the lake bottom, accompanied by marked changes in the content of pollen and macrofossils, such as the sudden occurrence of large amounts of Salix pollen and leaves, indicates a large hiatus. This is confirmed by the dating to c. 7 ka BP of mosses just below the sand, and of Salix leaves just above it to c. 1 ka BP. The hiatus must be caused by sediment slumping which transported all the sediment from the intervening period to the deeper part of the lake.

200,"Rate of Peat Increment in Hummock and Lawn Communities on Swedish Mires during the Last 150 Years | We have described the relationship between depth and age of surface peat in hummock and lawn communities on eleven Swedish mires in order to estimate the rate of annual peat increment. The study comprises peat down to a depth of ca. 0.6 m and altogether 679 age determinations were made. Peat younger than 50 yr was found at highly variable depths. Consequently, the rate of annual peat increment was also highly variable. The highest maximum rate of annual peat increment was always found in hummock communities. With increasing age of peat, the range of depths in which peat of a certain age occurred, decreased. This was more obvious in hummock than in lawn communities, indicating that the compaction was more pronounced in hummock communities. Most of the compaction occurred when the peat was younger than 50 yr. The age of the surface peat was determined by the use of small specimens of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. on which we measured the vertical distance from the growing point to the mire surface and counted the annual rings. | ['dahlberg', 'ohlson'] | ","['dahlberg', 'ohlson']",4

202,"Peatland dynamics in a complex landscape: Development of a fen-bog complex in the Sporadic Discontinuous Permafrost zone of northern Alberta, Canada | The development of a peatland complex in the Sporadic Discontinuous Permafrost zone of northwestern Alberta, Canada was reconstructed using a series of dated profiles. Peat-forming communities first established c. 10 230 cal. a BP, and by 8000 cal. a BP the site supported monocot fens or marshes in several isolated topographic depressions. Most of the current peatland area initiated between c. 8000 and 4000 cal. a BP, and involved the replacement of upland habitats by shrubby or treed fen and, in some areas, the establishment of Sphagnum on mineral terrain. Ombrotrophic hummock communities had established by c. 7000 cal. a BP, and permafrost was present at 6800 cal. a BP in at least some peat plateau areas. Macrofossil-based reconstructions show considerable local diversity in vegetation succession and permafrost dynamics, with cyclic collapse and aggradation in at least one profile and relative stability in others. Lichen-rich peat is rare in deep-peat plateau cores, and where charcoal was recovered, fire effects on vegetation trajectories varied between cores. Organic matter accumulation was high in the early Holocene and declined after permafrost formation, with low rates especially over the past 4000 years. The site was burned in a wildfire in 1971, and by 1998 permafrost had disappeared from almost all peat plateau areas. In this part of the discontinuous permafrost zone, peat plateaus are likely to be unsustainable under a warming climate. The hydrology and carbon dynamics of former plateau areas following large-scale permafrost degradation require further investigation. | ['bauer', 'vitt'] | ","['bauer', 'vitt']",2
203,"Periglacial landscape dynamics in the western Canadian Arctic: Results from a thermokarst lake record on a push moraine (Herschel Island, Yukon Territory) | Ice-rich permafrost landscapes are sensitive to climate and environmental change due to the melt-out of ground ice during thermokarst development. Thermokarst processes in the northern Yukon Territory are currently not well-documented. Lake sediments from Herschel Island (69 degrees 36'N; 139 degrees 04'W) in the western Canadian Arctic provide a record of thermokarst lake development since the early Holocene. A 727 cm long lake sediment core was analyzed for radiographic images, magnetic susceptibility, granulometry, and biogeochemical parameters (organic carbon, nitrogen, and stable carbon isotopes). Based on eight calibrated AMS radiocarbon dates, the sediment record covers the last similar to 11,500 years and was divided into four lithostratigraphic units (A to D) reflecting different thermokarst stages. Thermokarst initiation at the study area began similar to 11.5 cal ka BP. From similar to 11.5 to 10.0 cal ka BP, lake sediments of unit A started to accumulate in an initial lake basin created by melt-out of massive ground ice and thaw subsidence. Between 10.0 and 7.0 cal ka BP (unit B) the lake basin expanded in size and depth, attributed to talik formation during the Holocene thermal maximum. Higher-than-modern summer air temperatures led to increased lake productivity and widespread terrain disturbances in the lake's catchment. Thermokarst lake development between 7.0 and 1.8 cal ka BP (unit C) was characterized by a dynamic equilibrium, where lake basin and talik steadily expanded into ambient ice-rich terrain through shoreline erosion. Once lakes become deeper than the maximum winter lake ice thickness, thermokarst lake sediments show a great preservation potential. However, site-specific geomorphic factors such as episodic bank-shore erosion or sudden drainage through thermo-erosional valleys or coastal erosion breaching lake basins can disrupt continuous deposition. A hiatus in the record from 1.8 to 0.9 cal ka BP in Lake Herschel likely resulted from lake drainage or allochthonous slumping due to collapsing shore lines before continuous sedimentation of unit D recommenced during the last 900 years.

205,"A Holocene Perspective on Algal Mercury Scavenging to Sediments of an Arctic Lake | Anthropogenic activities have increased the amount of mercury (Hg) transported atmospherically to the Arctic. At the same time, recent climate warming is altering the limnolog of arctic lakes and ponds, including increases in aquatic primary production. It has been hypothesized that climate-driven increases in aquatic production have enhanced Hg scavenging from the water column, and that this mechanism may account for much of the recent rise in lake sediment Hg. Here, we test the relationship between climate, algal production, and sediment Hg using a well-dated and multiproxy lake sediment record spanning the Holocene from Lake CF3 (Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada). During the early Holocene, peak (summer) insolation drove July air temperatures higher than present, and resulted in increased autochthonous primary production as recorded by total organic matter, spectrally inferred Chl-a, diatom abundance, and carbon stable isotopic signatures. However, there are no relationships between any of these proxies and sediment Hg concentrations during this interval. Given that the behavior of preindustrial Hg was relatively stable during past intervals of naturally mediated high production, we surmise that postindustrial increases in Hg accumulation within CF3 reflect a multiplicative effect of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Hg and increased sedimentation rates. | ['balcom', 'briner', 'cooke', 'michelutti', 'wolfe'] | ","['balcom', 'briner', 'cooke', 'michelutti', 'wolfe']",2

Previous plant water calibration studies have focused on lower latitudes, but given the importance of arctic climate reconstructions, it is necessary to understand the drivers of isotope fractionation in plants that are unique to high latitudes. Here, we present delta D and delta O-18 values of plant waters from the Kangerlussuaq area in West Greenland. We use the evaporation line created by the xylem waters to estimate the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of local meteoric source water and find values that are lower than modeled estimates. We also apply the modified Craig-Gordon leaf water model, using local climate parameters and xylem water values to model leaf water values. We find that measured plant water values are generally in good agreement with model estimates, and discrepancies are likely explained by plant microclimates that are warmer and drier than average air measurements. This study extends stable isotope calibrations to arctic regions and provides a new estimate of average precipitation water isotopes values, which in turn inform plant proxy-based paleoclimate studies in the Arctic. | ['berke', 'bush', 'jacobson'] | ","['berke', 'bush', 'jacobson']",4
209,"Pollen-Based Stratigraphy of Is-Fiord Bottom Sediments, Western Spitsbergen | A pioneering high-resolution palynological investigation was conducted on bottom sediments retrieved from Is-fiord, Western Spitsbergen, during contract work in the Marine Arctic Geological Research Expedition (MAGE, Murmansk, Russian Federation) with the ""Arcticcoal'' Company. Three 140-190-cm-thick gravity cores were studied for pollen and spores, with the main aim of clarifying local patterns of the down-core pollen and spore distributions to further define the stratigraphic positions of retrieved marine strata. In spite of extremely low concentrations and the predominance of reworked microfossils, marine pollen spectra are quite similar to those known from radiocarbon-dated lake sediments and peat exposures on the coasts of the neighbouring fiords of Bulle (Dorozhkina 2005), Van Mijen (Zelikson 1971), and Hornsunn (Srodon 1960), provided that far-sourced pollen of conifers and spores of ferns are eliminated from marine pollen spectra compositions. The correlation of pollen zones (PZs) that were established in fiord sediments with those established in peat and lacustrine coastal sections enabled pollen-based stratigraphy to be established for Is-fiord bottom sediments, leading to an understanding of the features of the coastal vegetation and the tracking of the phases of its evolution based on marine pollen data. The oldest pollen spectra of the studied bottom-sediment sections are provisionally dated to the late Sub-Boreal period. They characterize the lowermost soft silty pelite layer and document that grass-cereal-sedge associations and heather bogs with green and sphagnous mosses dominated the vicinity of Is-fiord by the end of the late Sub-Boreal period, whereas osiers occupied elevated habitats. Pollen spectra in the upper part of the silty pelite layer in cores 11 and 14 and the whole section of core 9 from the northeastern inner part of the fiord are distinguished by peaks of Salix sp., Betula sect. Nanae-type, and Ericales pollens, and show the lowest percentages of spores of green mosses, thus supporting the reconstruction of heath and osier expansion under climatic conditions that were no colder than modern conditions. The characteristics of pollen spectra of the 22-25-cm-thick topmost over-watered layer are very similar to those from the surface sediments of Is-fiord. Therefore, their accumulation might be dated to the Sub-Atlantic period. They are notable for a considerable increase in sedge pollen, regarded as evidence for coastal bogging, probably due to a slight humidification of the climate. Extremely low pollen concentrations possibly reflect very high accumulation rates during the time of pelitic sedimentation. | ['rudenko'] | ",['rudenko'],2
210,"Pollen deposition rates in peat and lake sediments from the Pinus sylvestris L. forest-line ecotone of northern Norway | A comparative investigation of pollen deposition in peat and limnic sediments from the Pinus sylvestris-Alnus incana forest line in Dividalen, central Troms, northern Norway was performed by pollen analyses of sub-modern sediments. The possibilities of using 210Pb and 137Cs-datings in calculations of pollen influx in peat and limnic sediments are discussed. Correlation between the lead-cesium peat chronology and a marker-based limnic chronology is achieved at AD 1945-1946 by comparing the percentual pollen-curves. The upper 14 cm of the peat and 12 cm of the limnic sequence are hence supposed to represent the period ca. 1945-ca. 1996. The mean percentual representation of Pinus pollen is nearly twice as high in the peat sediments as in the limnic sediments, probably due to a slight over-representation from pine trees at the edge of the mire. The mean percentual pollen values for Alnus and Betula pubescens-type is fairly equal in peat and lake sediments, while the pollen influx rates are higher for all tree taxa in the lake sediments. This may be caused by the lake being exposed to a larger regional component than the smaller and topographically more sheltered mire. To achieve reliable pollen influx data at a near annual resolution, one needs a good control of the sedimentation processes, close intervals of isotope measurements and additional chronostrati-graphically fixed marker horizons. | ['jensen', 'kunzendorf', 'vorren'] | ","['jensen', 'kunzendorf', 'vorren']",2

The small numbers of pollen grains and spores in samples collected from glaciers is the result of the fact that they have accumulated only within the past year, whereas the spore/pollen spectra from the proglacial zone represent the accumulation of pollen and spores over several decades and even centuries. The composition of spectra from Colesdalen reflects, as a rule, local vegetation associations. Surface samples collected in Antarctica contain mainly pollen and spores transported from New Zealand and South America. An anthropogenic origin, however, is also possible.

The carbon isotope composition of peat varies from -28.05 to -30.05 parts per thousand (average -29.15 parts per thousand). The total PAH content varies from 11 to 360 ppb, with an average of 63 ppb and a median value of 34 ppb. Heavy compounds, such as benzo(a)anthracene and benzofluoranthenes, are prevalent among PAHs. The presence of PAHs in the peat is determined by three main factors: technogenic impact, wildfires, and biogeochemical soil processes. The prevalence of benzo(a)anthracene in the upper part of the palsa down to the bottom of the active layer suggests an anthropogenic impact (the influence of transport and domestic fuel combustion). The share of benzo(a)anthracene decreases with depth, while the share of benzofluoranthenes increases. Two sharp peaks of PAH content (260 and 360 ppb) are observed; they coincide with a local increase of carbon isotope values, most likely resulting from wildfires. The minimums in PAH content are presumably determined by the biogeochemical factor and the input of polyarenes generated by decomposition of plant residues. Carbon isotope composition of peat mainly reflects the isotope composition of vegetation, the degree of peat moistening, and the influence of pyrogenic factor. | ['belik', 'bludushkina', 'budantseva', 'gennadiev', 'ginzburg', 'vasilchuk', 'vasilchuk', 'vasilchuk', 'zavgorodnyaya'] | ","['belik', 'bludushkina', 'budantseva', 'gennadiev', 'ginzburg', 'vasilchuk', 'vasilchuk', 'vasilchuk', 'zavgorodnyaya']",2

216,"Postglacial flooding and vegetation history on the Ob River terrace, central Western Siberia based on the palaeoecological record from Lake Svetlenkoye | The hemispheric-scale climatic fluctuations during the Holocene have probably influenced the large Siberian rivers. However, detailed studies of the West Siberian Plain postglacial environmental change are scarce and the records of millennial-scale palaeohydrology are nearly absent. This paper presents the Holocene palaeoecological reconstruction based on the sedimentary record of Lake Svetlenkoye, located near the confluence of major Siberian rivers Ob and Irtysh. Postglacial history of flooding, dynamics of regional and local vegetation, sedimentation regime, geochemical changes and lake water pH were reconstructed based on multi-proxy studies. We used palaeobotanical (plant macrofossils, pollen, diatoms), geochemical (organic matter, total organic carbon and nitrogen content, carbon/nitrogen ratio) and chronological (C-14 dates, spheroidal fly-ash particle counts) methods. The studied sediment section started to accumulate 11,400 cal. yr BP. The initial shallow water body was flooded by Ob River waters 8100-8000 cal. yr BP as confirmed by a remarkable increase in the sedimentation rate and the accumulation rate of the aquatic vegetation proxies. The period of flooding coincides with the high humidity periods reconstructed from regional palaeobotanical records. About 6800-6700 cal. yr BP, the study site became isolated from the Ob River floodplain and remained a small lake until present. The diatom-based lake water pH estimates suggest fluctuations in the pH values during the Holocene, the recent decrease since 1960s being the most notable. The vegetation record revealed constant postglacial presence of tree taxa - Betula, Pinus and Picea - although in different pollen ratios and accumulation rates through time. The paludification of the surroundings occurred since ca. 8500 cal. yr BP. | ['alliksaar', 'amon', 'blaus', 'heinsalu', 'lapshina', 'liiv', 'reitalu', 'vassiljev', 'veski'] | ","['alliksaar', 'amon', 'blaus', 'heinsalu', 'lapshina', 'liiv', 'reitalu', 'vassiljev', 'veski']",2

Fourteen AMS-radiocarbon ages on organic macrofossils isolated from core sediment provide chronology for the records. Basal ages from two of the cores indicate deglaciation of the area prior to 11 000 BP. Radiocarbon ages associated with the marine-lacustrine sediment transition in the cores further constrain the emergence history of the area. The prominent late-glacial shoreline on the Murman coast (48 m a.s.l.) is dated to c. 10 500-10 300 BP, the emergence ages of lake basins 54 and 41 m a.s.l.

219,"Postglacial Vegetational Change and Soil Development in Southeastern Labrador Canada as Inferred from Pollen and Chemical Stratigraphy | Palynological and geochemical analyses of Holocene lake sediments are used to evaluate long-term interactions between vegetation and soils from four sites in southeastern Labrador, Canada. Changes in soil composition are inferred from the stratigraphy of humic materials and the elemental composition of authigenic and allogenic fractions of the sediment. Early Holocene lake muds deposited under tundra vegetation are predominantly inorganic and contain high concentrations of allogenic clastics derived from the erosion of barren soils. Concentrations of humic materials and redox-pH-sensitive elements (Fe, Mn, P, Al) of authigenic origin increase markedly with the subsequent invasion of spruce and fir (8000-7000 years BP). These changes represent decreased erosion of clastic minerals and increased mobilization of organometallic complexes from waterlogged soils produced through humus accumulation under coniferous vegetation. This transition of inorganic tundra inceptisols to humic-rich boreal spodosols contributed to the competitive replacement of Picea glauca and Abies balsamea by the more edaphically tolerant P. mariana between 6500 and 6000 years BP. A subsequent decline in sedimentary humic content and increase in allogenic components may signal a regional climatic cooling after 4000 years BP. Geochemical analyses of lake sediments reveal no stratigraphic changes in allogenic mineral composition that might indicate progressive soil weathering. | ['engstrom', 'hansen'] | ","['engstrom', 'hansen']",0

Freeze-cores were analysed for three lakes in southeastern Baffin Island. The sediment record in each lake consists of massive sediments overlain by an organic-rich, finely laminated section which continues to the surface. The laminae in Ogac Lake were studied in detail and consist of two types. These couplets are probably deposited as the result of diatom blooms in the late spring/summer growing season followed by settling of grains introduced by summer runoff. Sedimentation rates based on 210Pb dates agree well with rates based on laminae counts in both Ogac and Winton Bay Lakes, indicating that the laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Shallow-silled tidewater lakes with varved sediments may be relatively common along the coast of Baffin Island. It should thus be possible to create a network of sites with annually dated palaeoclimate records. | ['anderson', 'hughen', 'overpeck', 'williams'] | ","['anderson', 'hughen', 'overpeck', 'williams']",4

Pollen dates from ocean sediments were compared with marine carbonate (mollusk shells or foraminifera) dates from the same core levels, dates for which validity was assessed via correlations with other cores, and for which reworking has been excluded. Pollen samples from 3 tidal wetlands were taken from levels dated with 137Cs and 210Pb profiles. Pollen dates from 2 additional wetlands were compared with 14C dates of botanical macrofossils. Most pollen dates disagree with 14C dates based on macrofossils or carbonates, with age differences typically exceeding 250 yr and reaching 4000 yr in one instance. In some cores, pollen dates show age reversals. Significant proportions of reworked pollen grains in ocean and wetland samples are associated with pollen dates that are too old. Prolonged core storage could result in pollen 14C ages that are too young, possibly because of growth of fungi or other microbes, but more work is needed to verify this hypothesis. Despite the problems we encountered, some pollen dates are consistent with other 14C dates from the same core levels, suggesting this dating method can work, but at present, more work is needed to understand the conflicting results obtained. ¬© 2013 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona. | ['chmura', 'florin', 'pendea', 'levac', 'lewis', 'neulieb', 'southon'] | ","['chmura', 'florin', 'pendea', 'levac', 'lewis', 'neulieb', 'southon']",2

A considerable proportion of the total deposition of sulphur in northernmost Europe originates from the large non-ferrous smelters of the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Potential long-term effects of this point source pollution on sensitive subarctic lakes were evaluated using palaeolimnological techniques. 2. Multivariate analysis of a diatom and water chemistry data set from 45 small headwater lakes located in north-eastern Finnish Lapland demonstrated that pH, calcium and silica were the three most powerful chemical variables in explaining the variance in the diatom data. From these, lake water pH was shown to be the strongest determinator by variance partitioning. 3. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) was used to develop a diatom-based prediction model for inferring lake water pH from sediment core diatom assemblages. The performance of the model was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation. 4. The prediction model was applied to radiometrically dated sediment cores taken from three headwater lakes receiving different amounts of acid fallout from the Kola Peninsula smelter industry. 5.

223,"Present-day variability and Holocene dynamics of permafrost-affected lakes in central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia) inferred from diatom records | Thermokarst lakes are assumed to develop cyclically, driven by processes that are triggered by climate and maintained by internal feedbacks that may trigger lake drainage. However, the duration of these cycles remains uncertain, as well as whether or not they affect the stabilization of lake ecosystems in permafrost regions over millennial time scales. Our research has combined investigations into modern lake-to-lake variability with a study of the long-term development of individual lakes. We have investigated the physico-chemical and diatom compositions of a set of 101 lakes with a variety of different origins in central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia), including thermokarst lakes, fluvial-erosion thermokarst lakes, fluvial-erosion lakes, and dune lakes. We found a significant relationship between lake genesis and the present-day variability in environmental and diatom characteristics, as revealed by multi-response permutation procedures, indicator species analyses, and redundancy analyses. Environmental parameters also exhibit a significant correlation with variations in the diatom data, for which they may have been to a substantial extent responsible. Mg and SO4 concentrations, together with pH and water depth, were identified as the most important parameters, influencing the variations in the diatom data almost as much as the entire environmental parameter set. We were therefore able to establish a robust Mg-diatom transfer function, which was then applied to three Holocene lake records. From these reconstructions, together with a general interpretation of the diatom record (including, e.g., the ratio between benthic/epiphytic and planktonic taxa), we have been able to infer that all three of these lakes show (1) a continuous record with no desiccation events, (2) high lake water-levels during the early Holocene, (3) centennial to millennial scale variability, and (4) high levels of variability during the early Holocene but rather stable conditions during the late Holocene (a feature that is also known from other sites around the world). We therefore concluded that the development of these three lakes was mainly driven directly by the climate, rather than by thaw lake cycling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

225,"Prokaryotic community in Pleistocene ice wedges of Mammoth Mountain | Ice wedges differ from other types of surface and underground glacial bodies and are widely spread in perennially frozen sub-Arctic regions, but the bacterial and archaeal diversity in these permafrost features remains poorly studied. Here, we compared the prokaryotic community composition in the active layer and ancient, 13-19 kyr BP and similar to 40 kyr BP, ice wedge horizons from the same exposure profile of the Mammoth Mountain, using pyrosequencing 16S rRNA gene. The most abundant OTUs in the active layer were affiliated with Acidobacteria (31.81%) followed by Actinobacteria (18.29%), Proteobacteria (18.14%), Gemmatimonadetes (7.3%), Parcubacteria (7.13%) and Bacteroidetes (6.49%). The prokaryotic community in 13-19 kyr BP ice wedge differed at the phylum level by the predominance of Actinobacteria (29.15%) over Acidobacteria (19.52%), Proteobacteria (18.45%), Verrumicrobia (5.88%), Firmicutes (2.98%) and Gemmatimonadetes (2.87%). In contrast, the oldest (similar to 40 kyr BP) ice wedge prokaryotic community was rather poor, and only three phyla Firmicutes (54.48%), Proteobacteria (31.42%) and Bacteroidetes (7.92%) constituted the major fraction of reads. Archaeal sequences contributed with no more than 0.6% to total reads in all studied samples. Apparently, the Mammoth Mountain exposure profile harbors insular microbial communities with specific structure that reflects the stratigraphy, properties and age. | ['beletsky', 'brouchkov', 'cherbunina', 'filippova', 'mardanov', 'mulyukin', 'rakitin', 'sorokin', 'surgucheva'] | ","['beletsky', 'brouchkov', 'cherbunina', 'filippova', 'mardanov', 'mulyukin', 'rakitin', 'sorokin', 'surgucheva']",2
226,"Quantifying Lake Athabasca (Canada) water level during the 'Little Ice Age' highstand from palaeolimnological and geophysical analyses of a transgressive barrier-beach complex | We combine multiproxy palaeolimnological and geophysical analyses of a barrier-beach complex to estimate the water level of a sustained Lake Athabasca (Canada) highstand during the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA; 1600-1900 CE). Palaeolimnological analyses on sediment cores from the lagoon behind the barrier indicate high water levels during the LIA, controlled by subsurface hydrological connection with Lake Athabasca. Key features in the LIA stratigraphic interval are sand laminations deposited by overwash events and low C/N ratios reflecting deposition of predominantly aquatic organic matter. Ground penetrating radar profiles of the barrier reveal a depositional transgression sequence composed of waterlain landward-dipping foreset beds and horizontal topset beds, overlain by aeolian deposits. Stratigraphic relations suggest that the LIA washover deposits in the lagoon formed as the barrier was actively translating landward, and were generated by high-water events on Lake Athabasca that overtopped the barrier. This indicates Lake Athabasca rose to at least the elevation defined by the contact between the waterlain and aeolian sediments in the barrier, which is >4 m above the historical daily average from gauged records available since 1930 and likely represents storm events during the highstand. Assuming a similar relation between daily average and maximum lake level as in the historical gauge record, our findings suggest that Lake Athabasca was on average 2.3 m higher during the LIA than present day. Extrapolation of this high-water plane into the adjacent Peace-Athabasca Delta indicates that 70% of the modern landscape was frequently and perennially flooded until very recently, consistent with palaeolimnological evidence from several lakes in the delta. | ['edward', 'endres', 'hall', 'johnston', 'koester', 'light', 'martin', 'wiklund', 'wolfe'] | ","['edward', 'endres', 'hall', 'johnston', 'koester', 'light', 'martin', 'wiklund', 'wolfe']",4

The sequence mainly consisted of sandy loam sediments with large syngenetic ice wedges. Their width at the top was 1-3.5 m. Allochthonous organic material occurred in high content, concentrating as 0.5-0.7 m lenses. Shrub fragments, twigs, and mammoth bones were accumulated in peaty layers.

Several mid-Holocene phases of enriched delta-13C-org and delta-13C-cell, caused by elevated lake productivity, declining (CO-2(aq)), and closed basin conditions, were abruptly terminated by intervals of open hydrology recorded by sharply depleted delta-18O-cell. Two of these events, at 5000 and 4500 BP, are correlated with increased total organic content and Picea mariana pollen concentration, which indicate that high levels of productivity were also accompanied by northern treeline advances. A third treeline advance at about 2500 BP is also marked by an apparent outflow event from Toronto Lake, but this was not associated with delta-13C-org/cell enrichment in the sediment record because rapid and substantial lake water renewal probably prevented productivity-driven enrichment of the dissolved inorganic carbon and replenished the CO-2(aq) supply to thriving phytoplankton. However, high sediment organic content during this period suggests increased productivity. Increases in the inflow:evaporation ratio at about 6500 and 3500 BP were also sufficient to cause Toronto Lake to overflow but the prevailing climate during these periods apparently did not favour appreciable northward treeline migration or changes in lake productivity. | ['aravena', 'edward', 'macdonald', 'wolfe'] | ","['aravena', 'edward', 'macdonald', 'wolfe']",2
231,"Rapid lacustrine response to recent High Arctic warming: A diatom record from Sawtooth Lake, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut | Diatoms from Sawtooth Lake (79degree20'N, 81degree5'W) on the Fosheim Peninsula in Central Ellesmere Island, Canada were analyzed to assess the temporal extent and magnitude of climatic change in the High Arctic during the late Holocene. Diatom results from the sediment cores show an absence of diatoms throughout the last apprx2.5 ka (4.6 m) until the 1920s. However, ca. 1926 (5.3-cm depth), a rapid colonization of diatoms in the lake occurred. Within the uppermost section of the core (apprx1920 to apprx1997), the diatom flora shift from a small Fragilaria-dominated assemblage to a more diverse assemblage that is dominated by large planktonic taxa (e.g., Cyclotella bodanica) and large raphid benthic species. The postglacial nature of this assemblage suggests a decrease in ice cover and a concomitant increase in light and nutrient availability for diatom growth over the last apprx75 yr. Of particular significance is this absence of diatoms prior to the apprx1920s, which indicates that environmental conditions of the last apprx75 yr are unlike any of the previous apprx2500 yr. | ['bradley', 'francus', 'perren'] | ","['bradley', 'francus', 'perren']",4

233,"Recent (1930s) natural acidification and fish-kill in a lake that was an important food source for an Inuit community in northern Quebec, Canada | Isiurqutuuq Lake was an important food source for the Inuit community of Akulivik (northern Quebec, Canada) until the 1930s when the fish disappeared. Their disappearance was attributed to explosives used by prospectors. Modem lake water is acidic (pH 4.5), and most life forms are absent. A unit of sulphide-rich graphitic shale occurs throughout the watershed. The oxidation of sulphide minerals produces acidic water, rich in metals, including Zn, Cu and Ni. The lake is less than 15 m above sea level and close to the Hudson Bay coast. Ice sheets, which remained until about 8000 BP, depressed the region 150 m below the present levels, and when ice melted Isiurqutuuq Lake was part of the sea floor. Isostatic uplift exposed the sulphide zone on the north shore of the lake at similar to 2500 BP, followed by exposure of the lake. Weathering and oxidation of the sulphides was slow at the start, but increased steadily as frost heaving and fracturing permitted access of water and air to the sulphide zone. Diatom analysis of lake sediment cores reveals striking changes up-section. A clay unit at the base contains a marine-littoral diatom flora. Following uplift and marine regression, freshwater diatoms became established, dominated by circumneutral and alkaliphilous taxa. The subsequent appearance and increasing abundance of acidophilous diatoms reveal increasing acidification which culminates in the top 2 cm. The modern lake-bottom sediments are dominated by acidobiontic species that develop at pH values <5.5. This relatively late acidification is attributed to the initial buffering of acid by marine shells deposited when the lakebed was beneath Hudson Bay. Only when the shells were consumed did the lake become acidic. The scientific evidence is consistent with the observation of the Inuit population that the fish died our in the 1930s. Remediation of the problem is possible by neutralising the acid with modest addition in the lake of the abundant shell sand found in the Akulivik area. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Diatom assemblages were relatively constant throughout the core, except in the top 4-5 cm (apprxeq 1850 A.D.) where relative frequencies of Aulacoseira italica subsp. subarctica, A. lirata var. biseriata, Cyclotella comensis and C. glomerata increased markedly. No significant trends were observed in the weighted averaging (WA) reconstructed pH values. Several hypotheses, including (i) airborne pollution, (ii) climatic change, and (iii) catchment disturbances have been put forth to explain the recent changes in diatom assemblages. The diatom change coincides with a marked increase in mean annual temperature that has been documented in the area since the termination of the Little Ice Age. Our evidence favours climate change as the main causative mechanism for the observed diatom compositional changes, although other explanations cannot be ruled out. | ['korhola', 'sorvari'] | ","['korhola', 'sorvari']",4
235,"Recent increase in peatland carbon accumulation in a thermokarst lake basin in Southwestern Alaska | Drained thermokarst lake basins cover large areas of northern high latitude lowlands. However, the importance of peat accumulated in these drained basins to carbon (C) cycling is poorly understood. Results are presented here from a permafrost sediment core aimed at investigating site history, lake drainage, apparent carbon accumulation, and paleohydrology in a thermokarst basin on the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta in southwestern Alaska. The results show that a thermokarst lake existed for about 2300years before it drained and a peatland established in the early 1600s. Average apparent C accumulation rate (CAR) was 12gC/m2/yr over the 2300years before lake drainage, but increased to 120gC/m2/yr following peatland initiation. After transitioning to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland at ~1700AD, CAR reduced gradually before more than doubling from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. This abrupt increase in CAR was possibly in response to a Pacific climate regime shift in the late 1970s, a transition characterized by a nearly 1.5¬∞C increase in regional average annual temperature. Even after considering the differential decay of recent peat, there was an increase in C accumulation after 1977. Reconstructed water-table depths from subfossil testate amoebae show little change throughout the past three centuries, but there was a pronounced shift in testate amoeba composition after the 1977 temperature change (e.g., absence of Phryganella acropodia type and increase in Hyalosphenia elegans). If the results from peatlands in other drained thermokarst lake basins are consistent with the results from this study, then the C accumulated in these vegetated drained basins under current warming might help offset some of the C released from thawing permafrost and thermokarst features in northern regions. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V. | ['booth', 'klein', 'yu'] | ","['booth', 'klein', 'yu']",1
236,"Recent Lake Acidification and Cladoceran Dynamics Surface Sediment and Core Analyses from Lakes in Norway Scotland Uk and Sweden | To interpret the remains of Cladocera in lake sediments in relation to pH history, fish abundance, vegetation change, tropic level change and other historic events, it is necessary to understand the balance of abiotic and biotic forces responsible for their present distribution, population dynamics and morphological types. Once these factors are understood, we can reverse the arguments to infer past lake conditions. Many cladoceran species are influenced by fish and invertebrate predation. Some species, especially in the plankton, also show a clear physiological relation to pH and aluminum levels in lakes. Moreover, several littoral-benthic species have a habitat distribution restricted to rock, sand, mud, vegetation, or a combination of some of these. Remains of littoral and planktonic cladocerans were analyzed in surface sediments of 18 Norwegian lakes with pH ranging from 4.5-7.5. In addition, sediment cores from four sites in Norway, four in Scotland and one in Sweden were analyzed. The majority of sites showed evidence of recent acidification. In lakes with non-planktivorous fish, analyses of cladoceran remains gave no information on past fish populations, but indicated the pH history of the lakes. In lakes with present or past populations of planktivorous fish, the cladoceran record could be used to assess past fish status as well as past pH. In some lakes changes in the cladoceran communities could be related to changes in macrophyte distribution. | ['nilssen', 'sandoy'] | ","['nilssen', 'sandoy']",2
237,"Reconstruction of conditions of formation of the eutrophic peatland deposits in south of the taiga zone of Western Siberia | The paleoecological study of the peat deposit of the floodplain terrace eutrophic peatland located in south of the taiga zone of Western Siberia was carried out. The work is based on an integrated approach including the following methods: radiocarbon dating, macrofossil analysis, rhizopod analysis, humification degree and physico-chemical characteristics of humic acids of peats. Comparison of the results obtained by different methods allowed us to reconstruct the history of the development of floodplain terrace eutrophic peatland determined by the local hydrological, geomorphological and geochemical conditions on the background of climate change. At the first stage of development, the peatland was often flooded by the river, which provided additional introduction of mineral matters and followed by increased ash content of peat. Then the influence of the river had weakened, and the growth of the peat deposit was more determined by the factors of endogenous peat bog formation and the level of surface hydrological runoff. This led to the formation of peats with normal ash content; hygrophytic grasses were replaced with sedges and hypnum plant assemblages. The eutrophic peatland showed the highest sensitivity to climate change over the last 8500 years. It is confirmed with synchronous variations of surface wetness in different bogs of the study area. ¬© 2018 Russian Academy of Sciences.

239,"Regional influence of acid deposition and climate change in European mountain lakes assessed using diatom transfer functions | P>1. Mountain lake sediments are valuable archives of environmental change. However, the presence of multiple drivers of change over similar or overlapping timescales may obscure palaeolimnological signals obtained using traditional statistical analyses.2. As part of the European Union-funded EMERGE programme, sediment cores were obtained from 209 mountain lakes across 11 lake districts spanning gradients of altitude, latitude, geochemistry and atmospheric deposition. Surface sediments (0-0.5 cm) were subsampled to represent modern conditions corresponding with chemical and environmental measurements, while core bottom (15-17 cm) sediments were subsampled to represent the pre-industrial period.3. We used a novel approach to explore the relative importance of environmental drivers of change in diatom communities. First, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to identify the most significant variables explaining diatom community distributions in lake surface sediments. Lake water pH, nitrate concentration/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ice-free period were identified as uniquely significant explanatory variables along three primary axes of variation. The modern data set was then used to construct transfer functions linking diatom communities to these key variables. We applied these transfer functions to core bottom samples to reconstruct change since the pre-industrial period.4. Drivers of diatom community change differed among regions. Diatom-inferred pH declined in five acid-sensitive lake districts (Central & Southern Norway, Piedmont Ticino, Retezat Mountains, Scotland and Tatra Mountains), consistent with acidification caused by sulphur and nitrogen deposition. Diatom-inferred pH increased in two lake districts [Julian Alps (JA), Pyrenees (PY)], probably due to eutrophication and climate warming-induced increases in weathering rates respectively.5. Diatom inference models for nitrate and DOC were not independent. However, diatom-inferred nitrate increased in all lake districts with detectable changes, except for the Retezat Mountains. These changes are consistent with increased nitrogen deposition and leaching in the industrial period and are independent of acidification effects, presumably reflecting a nitrogen fertilization effect. Diatom-inferred DOC increased in the Central Alps and Scotland but decreased in Central Norway and Northern Finland, in contrast to increasing trends reported for Northern Europe and North America over the last 10-20 years. Conflicting drivers of change in DOC such as recovery from acidification and climate change further confound the interpretation of diatom-inferred changes.6. Changes in the diatom-inferred ice-free period varied across regions. Warming is indicated in Central Norway, Scotland, Piedmont Ticino and the Pyrenees, while cooling is suggested in the more southern and eastern Julian Alps and Rila Mountains. Where detectable changes in diatom-inferred pH and ice-free period coincide there is generally an association between acidification and climate warming. Since warming is associated with increased weathering and alkalinity generation it is therefore possible that climate warming has reduced the impacts of acidification in acid-sensitive lake districts. | ['battarbee', 'catalan', 'clarke', 'curtis', 'juggins', 'kernan', 'posch', 'thompson'] | ","['battarbee', 'catalan', 'clarke', 'curtis', 'juggins', 'kernan', 'posch', 'thompson']",0
240,"Relative importance of hydrological and climatic controls on Holocene paleoenvironments inferred using diatom and pollen records from a lake in the central Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada | Postglacial paleoenvironmental changes and landscape development in the Hudson Bay Lowlands in subarctic Canada were inferred using sediment properties and diatom and pollen assemblages in the sediments of a lake raised above the surrounding peatlands in an ice-marginal landform. Coarse-grained, inorganic sediments at the base of the Lake AT01 core suggest a high-energy periglacial environment, following isostatic emergence from Hudson Bay around 6840 cal. BP. Initial diatom assemblages dominated by Fragilaria spp., and pollen of Shepherdia canadensis, indicate early successional conditions in a recently deglaciated environment. Around 6200 cal. BP, tychoplanktonic Fragilarioid diatoms are replaced by large benthics. Coincident increases in Equisetum spores, Cyperaceae pollen and sediment organic matter suggest the establishment of a more productive macrophyte-rich shallow lake. While the Holocene Thermal Maximum and subsequent Neoglacial may have contributed to these shifts, pollen and diatom records suggest only subtle responses to Holocene climatic changes. A core chronology inferred from radioisotopes suggests a hiatus in sediment accumulation between 3650 and 200 cal. BP. Peaks in carbonate inferred from loss-on-ignition and increases in bulk density in that section of the core suggest some effect of erosional or thermokarst processes, or the breaching of a sandbar, now a remnant island in the lake, in the drainage of the lake and ensuing hiatus. Sediment accumulation resumed within the past two centuries; diatom assemblages in the uppermost section are characterized initially by benthic diatoms of smaller valve size compared with the pre-hiatus assemblages. More recently, increases in the planktonic diatom Cyclotella stelligera are recorded, signaling significant environmental changes. | ['davis', 'finkelstein', 'friel'] | ","['davis', 'finkelstein', 'friel']",2

Transverse geomorphological profiles through the valley, a map of ruggedness relief density, a geomorphological scheme of the investigated area were constructed. The structure of the terraces was studied, and the sediments were dated by the method of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon method. Spore-pollen spectra of terraces and the content of diatom algae in sediments were studied. In the valley we fixed a low and high floodplain up to a height of 10-12 m, two terraces, the height of which varies along the river (5-20 and 30-70 m), and Abalakh plain at an altitude of 100-140 m above the river. Near Yakutsk, the first terrace is called the Sergelyakh and the second terrace is called the Bestyakh. The low floodplain has an age of the first hundred years; the first terrace is dated by 10,000 radiocarbon years, datings of the bestyakh terrace belong to the end of Karginsky time and Sartan time of the Late Pleistocene. The most ancient OSL-datings were obtained from the deposits of the erosion scarp of the Abalakh plain (234-182 thousand years ago). The surface of the bestyakh terrace is decreasing downstream from 60 m at the mouth of the Buotama River to 40 m downstream from the confluence with Aldan River. The deposits of the terrace downstream from the mouth of Aldan River consists of silt mainly by contrast with sand compositions of Lena deposits upstream from the confluence of two rivers. The height of terraces and floodplains varies on the investigated segment of the valley in such a way that the same surface can be worked out in sediments of different ages, or the same age can be distinctive to geological bodies, in which terraces with different altitudes have been developed. ¬© 2018 St. Petersburg University Press.

243,"A high resolution multi-proxy record of pronounced recent environmental change at Baker Lake, Nunavut | Arctic aquatic systems are considered to be especially sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, which can have cascading effects on biological communities as aquatic food-web structure is altered. Bio-indicators that respond to major limnological changes can be used to detect and infer major environmental change, such as climate warming, with the use of paleolimnological techniques. A multi-proxy approach was used to quantify recent environmental changes at Baker Lake, Nunavut, Arctic Canada. Analyses of fossilized remains of chironomids and diatoms were conducted on a sediment core of 20 cm in length sampled at 0.5-cm intervals. A new surface sediment training set of subfossil chironomid assemblages from 65 lakes across the eastern Canadian Arctic generated a robust (r (jack) (2) = 0.79) surface water paleotemperature transfer function. The transfer function was applied to stratigraphic intervals from the Baker Lake sediment core to generate a paleotemperature reconstruction of sub-decadal resolution. The surface water temperature reconstruction inferred a 2A degrees C increase in mid-summer surface water temperature for Baker Lake over the last 60 years, which was corroborated by the local instrumental record spanning the period of 1950-2007 AD. The chironomid record shows a recent decline of several cold-water taxa and appearance of warm-water indicators. This shift in community structure began circa 1906 AD, and intensified after 1940 AD. The corresponding fossil diatom record showed an increase in small planktonic Cyclotella taxa over the past 60 years, intensifying in the last 5 years, which also suggests a warmer climate and longer ice-free periods. The shifts in the diatom assemblages began later than the shifts in the chironomid assemblages, and were of lower magnitude, reflecting differences in the mechanisms in which these two indicators respond to environmental change. | ['finkelstein', 'friel', 'medeiros', 'quinlan'] | ","['finkelstein', 'friel', 'medeiros', 'quinlan']",2
244,"Response of diatoms and other siliceous indicators to the developmental history of a peatland in the Tiksi Forest, Siberia, Russia | Diatoms and other siliceous microfossils were examined from a 386-cm-long peat core, covering the last ca. 7200 yr, from north-central Siberia to gain insights into peatland developmental history, and to explore the potential of diatoms as proxy indicators in arctic peats. Diatom analyses of arctic peatlands are rare, and so one aspect of this study was to examine the sensitivity of diatom taxa in relation to independent paleoindicators already described from this core. Changes in the relative abundances of diatom taxa divided the core into four zones that closely tracked the ontogeny of the peatland from an open water environment (Zone I: benthic, alkaliphilic taxa), followed by fen environments (Zones II and III; epiphytic, acidophilic taxa), and finally to a better-drained, high-centered bog (Zone IV; aerophilic taxa). In addition to the diatom taxa, observations were made on the relative abundances of siliceous protozoan plates, chrysophyte cysts, and phytoliths. Both the diatoms and these other siliceous microfossils appeared to respond to changes in hydrology and moisture, as well as to fire episodes likely triggered by climatic change. This study demonstrates that diatoms and other siliceous microfossils from arctic peat deposits provide an important source of paleoenvironmental information that can strengthen interpretations derived from other commonly used indicators. | ['jasinski', 'ruhland', 'smol', 'warner'] | ","['jasinski', 'ruhland', 'smol', 'warner']",0

This is the first report on Holocene seabird occupation on Ny-lesund and it provides the foundation for understanding the ecological history of seabirds in Svalbard in Holocene. | ['liu', 'long', 'sun', 'wang', 'xie', 'yuan'] | ","['liu', 'long', 'sun', 'wang', 'xie', 'yuan']",2
247,"Seabird Transfer of Nutrients and Trace Elements from the North Water Polynya to Land during the Mid-Holocene Warm Period, Carey Islands, Northwest Greenland | Seabird guano from large nesting colonies is known to increase trace metal levels in adjacent terrestrial environments today, when global oceans are contaminated with Hg, Cd, and other metals. But the effect of seabird guano in the pre-industrial period has rarely been studied. We used stable C and N isotopic and trace element analyses of a peat core that represents ca. 2000 years of organic matter accumulation to examine the effect on trace elements and nutrients of a seabird colony that existed in northern Baffin Bay during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (ca. 8000-5000 yr BP). Although C and N concentrations were typical of those in other peats, isotopic data identified marine organic matter as the main source of N and a minor source of C in the peat and showed that the unknown seabird was a fish-eating species that was summer-resident for the 2000 yr period. Concentrations of Cd, Br, Sr, and Zn in peat were up to an order of magnitude higher than in ombrotrophic (air-fed) bogs elsewhere, whereas Hg and Cu concentrations were similar to those in other peats, suggesting relatively low levels of Hg and Cu in the guano. This surprising result for Hg contrasts with studies on modern seabirds, in which guano markedly increased environmental Hg concentrations. It could be a consequence of Hg concentrations in Arctic marine food webs in the pre-industrial period that were an order of magnitude lower than those of today. | ['bennike', 'goodsite', 'outridge', 'rausch', 'shotyk'] | ","['bennike', 'goodsite', 'outridge', 'rausch', 'shotyk']",2
248,"Sediment Chemistry and Diatom Stratigraphy of Two High Arctic Isolation Lakes Truelove Lowland Devon Island Northwest Territories Canada | Three sediment cores from two lakes, Fish Lake and Phalarope Lake, in Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, N.W.T. were analyzed for diatoms and chemical composition. Multivariate statistical techniques using a range of chemical variables successfully isolated three sediment groupings in the cores. Allochthonous and autochthonous chemical components in the sediments have been used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions. The two lakes began approximately 10600 years ago as shallow marine lagoons that were isolated from the sea as a result of glacio-isostatic rebound. Based on the presence of distinctive diatom assemblages, the three stratigraphic zones are identified as a basal marine zone, an intermediate and transitional brackish/marine zone and an upper freshwater zone. Following isolation from the sea, the lakes were flushed with freshwater produced by snow and ice melt. In Fish Lake, the period of transition from marine to freshwater, which began approximately 7000 years ago, lasted approximately 800 years. In Phalarope Lake, which was isolated from the sea approximately 5000 years ago, flushing by fresh water was completed only within the last 300 years. Fe, Cr, and Mo in the sediments are associated with the isolation phase when lake sedimentation is sensitive to the presence of brackish water and erosion within the lake catchments. In particular, the precipitation of Mo as MoS2 reflects the presence of hypolimnetic anoxia associated with lake isolation. During the early post-isolation phase the response of lake biota to an influx of nutrients is reflected in an increase in biological silica and organic carbon in the lake sediments. On the other hand, the generally low organic content of the sediments indicates that sedimentation in these lakes has been largely determined by variations in non-biogenic factors through time. During the mid Holocene the progressive stabilization of surface materials within the lake catchments is marked by decreasing Cr, As and Na in the sediments. At the same time, an increase in allochthonous Mn and Fe is attributed to progressive soil development. During the last 2500 years the catchments have experienced decreased erosion resulting in a decrease in both allochthonous clastic input and lake productivity. | ['king', 'young'] | ","['king', 'young']",2
249,"Holocene Sedimentation in Glacial Tasikutaaq Lake Baffin Island Northwest Territory Canada | Tasikutaaq Lake, on Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, receives inflow and fine sediment from a 448 km2 drainage basin, 21% of which is glacier covered. During the summer of 1983 the lake remained essentially isothermal between about 4 and 6.degree.C. The suspended sediment concentration of inflow never exceeded 100 mg L-1, with overflow and homopycnal flow dominant. Surface sediments are clearly laminated, although varves are not apparent. The sediments are very fine, with less than 3% sand in all but the most proximal sites. Average sedimentation rates between 1976 and 1983 ranged from about 4 mm a-1 to 0.25 mm a-1 down lake from the point of inflow. The absence of varves is a function of the low rates of sediment accumulation and the long residence time of the fine sediments in the water column. Three sediment cores up to 135 cm in length reveal marked changes in sediment characteristics and diatom assemblages through the Holocene. During the late Foxe Glaciation it is likely that glacier ice contacted the lake, with retreat upvalley recorded by thinly varved (?) silts. By 7580 .+-. 140 BP ice had retreated to near its present margins. The earliest diatom assemblage in the cores is dominated by small Fragilaria spp., typical of late glacial, pioneering environments. Sedimentation rates during much of the Hypsithermal were about five times less than at present, with the resulting massive sediments having ""nonglacial"" characteristics despite the presence of glacial ice in the drainage basin. A planktonic diatom flora suggests that summer lake ice cover was minimal at this time. A climatic deterioration at about 4500 BP marks the onset of the Neoglacial, recorded by a shift in the diatom assemblage to species characteristic of more shallow water environments. Retreat from Neoglacial moraines is recorded by clearly laminated sediments and increasing accumulation rates. In general, laminated sediments relate to periods of high sediment input associated with glacial retreat, whereas massive sediments relate to low sediment input in association with glacial stabilization or advance. | ['gilbert', 'hall', 'lemmen', 'smol'] | ","['gilbert', 'hall', 'lemmen', 'smol']",4

The results together with 14C-datings, show that the introduction of agriculture took place from the S-SW in the SW archipelago as early as 3600.+-.90 BP (before present). This, however, does not explain the early pollen and charcoal dust evidence of cultivation in the Kainuu district where corresponding datings of 3680.+-.90 BP have recently been obtained, or in Siilinjarvi where evidence of early cultivation around 3000 BP has also been recorded. | ['vuorela'] | ",['vuorela'],2
251,"The significance of zonal, regional and local vegetation elements in lacustrine pollen spectra | Present day lakes of all sizes, are ""collectors"" of pollen and spores from the vegetation cover of their watershed area. The pollen assemblages of their bottom sediments are 95% due to the effect of winds. In spite of a great variation in limnic characteristics, the decisive factor determining the composition of the subrecent spectra of the largest lakes is their enormous dimensions (Ladoga, Onega, Vozhe, Lacha, Kubenskoye, Ilmen and others) and their location within a single vegetation zone - middle and south taiga. The spectra of these lakes gives a highly averaged and floristically poor description of the vegetation at the highest taxonomic level - subzonal and formation-group. Pollen of the zonal vegetation - pine and spruce - predominates in the sediments. The smaller the water body (lakes of various types in the Karelian Isthmus and on the East Latvian Plateau), the greater is the influence of the surrounding vegetation cover (regional factor) on the pollen spectra. In small water bodies the regional and local elements of the vegetation cover are of great importance - birch, alder, willow and herbs belong to this group. The pollen of plants growing in the lake scarcely plays any part in those lakes investigated, despite their being strongly overgrown. This is due both to the exceedingly low pollen productivity of lake plants in comparison with that of terrestrial plants and to the destruction of pollen grains under the prevailing hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions, because their pollen have thin exines. | ['khomutova'] | ",['khomutova'],4

The size alterations appeared to be species specific and the studied taxa showed different patterns of morphometic change along the nutrient gradients.

253,"Soil Development as an Indication of Relative Age of Quaternary Deposits Baffin Island Northwest-Territories Canada | Soils can aid in subdivision and correlation of Quaternary deposits in eastern Baffin Island. The most useful data consist of horizon thicknesses and the intensity of oxidation in horizons beneath the A horizon. For Polar Desert soils formed from tills under a sparse lichen cover, the following trends are noted: soils .apprx. 200 yr old exhibit very subtle Cox horizons no more than 5 cm thick; those .apprx. 700 yr old have subtle Cox colors, with a maximum thickness of 30 cm; soils considered to have formed since late Wisconsin (.apprx. 10,000 yr) have weak cambic B horizons that are < 9 cm thick; and well-expressed cambic B horizons, up to 24 cm thick, characterize early Wisconsin tills (.apprx. 100,000 yr old). Under a full vegetation cover, Arctic Brown soils form from marine deltaic deposits along the coast. Compared to the above Polar Desert soils, mostly located inland, the horizons in the Arctic Brown soils are thicker, some are more intensely oxidized, and development rates are perhaps ten times more rapid. In contrast to the success in using field soil data for age differentiation, laboratory data on particle-size distribution, organic matter, and pH were not consistently useful.

254,"Holocene Soligenous Fens on a High Arctic Fault Block Northern Ellesmere Island 82 Degrees N Northwest Territories Canada | Exceptionally thick (4 m) autochthonous peat deposits were investigated on a high arctic fault block in the foothills of the Grant Land Mountains, northern Ellesmere Island (82.degree.N). These organic sediments are rich in macrofossils, and contained undecomposed lichen thalli, bryophytes, Dryas integrifolia plants, arctic hare coprolites, and bird bones. A quantitative macrofossil analysis (percent volume) was done on four of the deposits for paleoenvironmental interpretation. Twenty-eight species of mosses from the peat sections represent 25% of the extant moss flora and occur in analogous contemporary assemblages. Four species are new to the North American fossil record. [They include: Arctoa Fulvella var. andersonii, Bartramia ithylphylla, Plagiomnium medium and Psilopilum cavifolium]. The dominant pest-forming mosses were Philonotis fontana, Tomenthypnum nitens, Aulacomnium spp., Hylocomium splendens, and Tortula ruralis. The chronology indicates a minimum date for peat formtion of 6315 BP (S-2449). The youngest sample dated was 760 BP (S-2449), though surface assemblages indicate extant peat-forming assemblages. The subfossil analyses show that a diverse moss flora was present on the fault block prior to the mid-Holocene. The species composition and rates of net organic accumulation are highly variable for concurrent intervals within adjacent peats. This variability demonstrates that changes in local hydrology and slope process dominate over macroclimate changes. This precludes a simple model for soligenous fen development in the High Arctic. | ['england', 'lafarge', 'england', 'vitt'] | ","['england', 'lafarge', 'england', 'vitt']",2
255,"Spatial patterns of modern diatom distribution and multiple paleolimnological records from a small arctic lake of Baffin Island, Arctic Canada | The assumption that within-lake, deep-water sedimentary diatom assemblages are relatively uniform and that a single core is sufficient to depict lake ontogeny was tested for a small tarn on the southwestern Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island, Northwest Territories. Diatom transport and deposition were evaluated through analyses of periphytic, planktonic, and epipelic habitats. Diatom stratigraphies of four cores were used to test whether or not trends are comparable in different regions of the lake and throughout the Holocene. Among 12 surface-sediment stations, diatom distributions were alternately highly equitable or variable. Valves of evenly distributed genera (Aulacoseira and Achnanthes) are mixed in the water column prior to deposition. This is supported by plankton tow and periphyton samples, which were respectively dominated by Aulacoseira distans (and varieties) and Achnanthes altaica. Conversely, frequencies of several benthic taxa (e.g., Pinnularia biceps, species of Eunotia) varied up to 30% between stations, in patterns unrelated to water depth, and reflecting habitat specificity and minimal transport prior to burial. Of the four cores (38.0-95.5 cm), analysis of the two longest revealed three distinct zones: (i) a zone dominated by species of Fragilaria ( gt 9000 BP); (ii) a zone containing benthic acidophilic diatoms indicating natural acidification (9000-7000 BP); and (iii) a zone characterized by numerous species of Aulacoseira ranging from the mid to late Holocene. Clear differentiation of the lower two zones was impossible in the shorter cores, and radiocarbon dates suggest that sediment reworking truncated the earliest records of organic sedimentation at these sites. Correspondence analysis facilitated comparisons of the diatom stratigraphies and enabled the evaluation of core reproducibility. Central cores preserve the most useful paleolimnological records in this environment. | ['wolfe'] | ",['wolfe'],2
256,"Sphagnum delta C-13 values as indicators of palaeohydrological changes in a peat bog | Late-Holocene peat stratigraphy of a Canadian boreal peat bog was examined to evaluate the potential of Sphagnum delta C-13 values as surface moisture proxy indicators. Isotopic measurements were compared to testate amoebae-inferred water-table depth reconstructions, plant macrofossil assemblages and past decomposition levels inferred by colorimetric humification. AMS radiocarbon dates were coupled with Pb-210 dates to establish peat chronology. Although the mechanisms underlying carbon fractionation processes in peatlands are not well understood, we demonstrate that Sphagnum delta C-13 values have potential for palaeohydrological reconstructions, since variations presented by the isotopic values can generally be correlated with the other proxy records, especially during drier episodes. | ['garneau', 'helie', 'loisel'] | ","['garneau', 'helie', 'loisel']",2
257,"Stable carbon isotope compositions of Eastern Beringian grasses and sedges: Investigating their potential as paleoenvironmental indicators | The nature of vegetation cover present in Beringia during the last glaciation remains unclear. Uncertainty rests partly with the limitations of conventional paleoecological methods. A lack of sufficient taxonomic resolution most notably associated with the grasses and sedges restricts the paleoccological inferences that can be made. Stable isotope measurements of subfossil plants are frequently used to enhance paleoenvironmental reconstructions. We present an investigation of the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of modern and subfossil grasses and sedges (graminoids) from Eastern Beringia. Modern grasses from wet habitats had a mean delta C-13 of -29.1 parts per thousand. (standard deviation [SD] = 2.1 parts per thousand, n = 75), while those from dry habitats had a mean of -26.9 parts per thousand (SD = 1.19, n = 27). Sedges (n = -50) from dry, wet, marsh, and sand dune habitats had specific habitat ranges. Four modern C-4 grasses had delta C-13 values typical Of C4 plants. Analyses were also conducted using subfossil graminoid remains from several sedimentary paleoecological contexts (e.g., arctic ground squirrel nests, loess, permafrost, and paleosols) in Eastern Beringia. Results from these subfossil samples, ranging in age from > 40,000 to ca. 11,000 cal. yr BP, illustrate that the delta C-13 of graminoid remains has altered during the past. The range of variation in the subfossil samples is within the range from modern graminoid specimens from dry and wet habitats. The results indicate that stable isotopes could contribute to a comprehensive and multiproxy reconstruction of Beringian paleoenvironments. | ['bennett', 'boone', 'edward', 'froese', 'parker', 'wooller', 'zazula'] | ","['bennett', 'boone', 'edward', 'froese', 'parker', 'wooller', 'zazula']",2
258,"Stratified interglacial lacustrine sediments from Baffin Island, Arctic Canada: Chronology and paleoenvironmental implications | Thirteen of 18 piston cores recovered from 'Robinson Lake' in the mid-Arctic vegetation zone of Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, penetrated stratified lacustrine sediment beneath a thin over-consolidated diamict (till) and postglacial lacustrine sediment. The sub-till lacustrine units are up to 120 cm thick, of which the upper several decimeters frequently contain thick, layered mats of aquatic moss; pollen and diatoms are common throughout both lacustrine units. A series of 23 AMS 14C dates defines the chronology of the postglacial sequence, which records a succession from a pioneer grass- and Oxyria-dominated tundra between 10.4 and 8 ka BP, to a sedge-dominated tundra after 8 ka BP. Limiting 14C dates place the sub-till lacustrine sediments more than 40 ka BP; 10 luminescence dates centered on 85 ka indicate they were deposited late in oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5. The dominance of shrub and tree pollen, especially shrub birch and alder, in sub-till lacustrine samples, indicates low-arctic tundra farther north than at any time during the Holocene. Pollen concentrations are comparable to or higher than in the Holocene units. Cooling late in the interglacial is indicated by declining birch and alder pollen percentages in the upper part of the section. Diatom floras in both the sub-till and postglacial lacustrine sequences indicate similar development of lake-water chemistry, but input of silica and weathering products was greater in the older lake cycle, suggesting more vigorous catchment processes. Macrofossils in the sub-till units are characteristic of lakes ice-free in summer. Based on pollen assemblages indicating local and regional vegetation diagnostic of summer temperatures higher than the Holocene, we interpret the sub-till lacustrine units to be of interglacial character. By analogy with Holocene plant succession in central and eastern Canada, all of Keewatin and Labrador/Ungava must have been ice free throughout this interval, suggesting essentially complete deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at the time. | ['bennike', 'forman', 'miller', 'mode', 'sauer', 'short', 'stafford', 'jr', 'wolfe'] | ","['bennike', 'forman', 'miller', 'mode', 'sauer', 'short', 'stafford', 'jr', 'wolfe']",2
259,"Stratigraphy Paleoecology and Glacial History of the Gillam Area Manitoba Canada | Sections along the Nelson River in northern Manitoba, outcropping upstream and downstream from Limestone Dam, record a long succession of late Quaternary events. The oldest sediment exposed consists of sandy, nonfossiliferous Sundance till of northwestern provenance and related to a Kansan or Illinoian glaciation. The paleosol developed in the Sundance till is assigned to the Yamouthian or Sangamon interglacial on its stratigraphic position and depth of weathering. Fossiliferous, clayey Amery till of eastern provenance overlies the Sundance till and underlies the nonglacial Nelson River sediments. Aspartic acid D/L ratios of wood fragments from the Nelson River sediments correlate with an aspartic acid D/L ratio of similar wood from the Missinaibi Formation in Ontario. Beetle analysis indicates the Nelson River sediments were deposited north of the tree line under conditions more severe than those found in the area today. The deposits are believed to be of latest Sangamon or possibly Mid-Wisconsinan age. The Wisconsinan Stage is represented by the Long Spruce and Sky Pilot tills deposited by ice from the east. These tills are texturally and compositionally similar but are different colours. The overlying Henday sediments record glaciofluvial deposition and mass wasting along the eastward retreating ice margin. Varves indicate the area was covered by glacial Lake Agassiz for less than 100 years after the ice retreated. The breakup of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in Hudson Bay and the final drainage of Lake Agassiz took place 7800-8000 years ago when the Hudson Bay Lowland was inundated by the marine water of the Tyrrell Sea.

260,"The structuring role of fish in Greenland lakes: an overview based on contemporary and paleoecological studies of 87 lakes from the low and the high Arctic | Lakes in Greenland are species-poor ecosystems and many are fishless. We studied the structuring role of fish in lakes in high- and low-Arctic Greenland. Major differences were observed in the trophic structure of the 87 lakes studied. Pelagic zooplankton biomass was on average 3-4-fold higher in the fishless lakes and dominated by large-bodied taxa such as Daphnia, the phyllopod Branchinecta and the tadpole shrimp Lepidurus. In contrast, small-bodied crustaceans dominated the lakes with fish. Analysis of microcrustacean remains in the surface sediment and contemporary benthic invertebrates also showed a marked influence of fish on community structure and the size of the taxa present. The cascading effect of fish on the microbial communities was modest, and no differences were observed for chlorophyll a. The cascading effect of fish on invertebrates depended, however, on the species present, being largest between fishless lakes and lakes hosting only sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), while lakes with both Arctic charr (Salvelinus arcticus) and stickleback revealed a more modest response, indicating that presence of charr modulates the predation effect of sticklebacks. It is predicted that more lakes in Greenland will be colonised by fish in a future warmer climate, and this will substantially alter these vulnerable ecosystems. | ['amsinck', 'christoffersen', 'davidson', 'geertz', 'hansen', 'jeppesen', 'landkildehus', 'lauridsen', 'riget', 'sondergaard'] | ","['amsinck', 'christoffersen', 'davidson', 'geertz', 'hansen', 'jeppesen', 'landkildehus', 'lauridsen', 'riget', 'sondergaard']",1

Sediment cores from the littoral zones were sampled, sectioned every centimetre and aged with Pb-210. The number of taxa of both Cladocera and Pediastrum identified in the cores was high, while the number of individuals in each taxon was low. In Lake Kevojarvi, twenty five Cladocera species and eight Pediastrum species were found. Along with widely distributed species, typical for north boreal regions, species preferring more temperate environments occurred. In Lake Petajalampi, the species composition was similar. Twenty one Cladocera species and five Pediastrum species occurred there, however with a lower frequency of individuals in each taxon.

264,"Temporal deconvolution of vascular plant-derived fatty acids exported from terrestrial watersheds | Relatively little is known about the amount of time that lapses between the photosynthetic fixation of carbon by vascular land plants and its incorporation into the marine sedimentary record, yet the dynamics of terrestrial carbon sequestration have important implications for the carbon cycle. Vascular plant carbon may encounter multiple potential intermediate storage pools and transport trajectories, and the age of vascular plant carbon accumulating in marine sediments will reflect these different pre-depositional histories. Here, we examine down-core C-14 profiles of higher plant leaf wax-derived fatty acids isolated from high fidelity sedimentary sequences spanning the so-called ""bomb-spike"", and encompassing a ca. 60-degree latitudinal gradient from tropical (Cariaco Basin), temperate (Saanich Inlet), and polar (Mackenzie Delta) watersheds to constrain integrated vascular plant carbon storage/transport times (""residence times""). Using a modeling framework, we find that, in addition to a ""young"" (conditionally defined as < 50 y) carbon pool, an old pool of compounds comprises 49 to 78 % of the fractional contribution of organic carbon (OC) and exhibits variable ages reflective of the environmental setting. For the Mackenzie Delta sediments, we find a mean age of the old pool of 28 ky (+/- 9.4, standard deviation), indicating extensive pre-aging in permafrost soils, whereas the old pools in Saanich Inlet and Cariaco Basin sediments are younger, 7.9 (+/- 5.0) and 2.4 (+/- 0.50) to 3.2 (+/- 0.54) ky, respectively, indicating less protracted storage in terrestrial reservoirs. The ""young"" pool showed clear annual contributions for Saanich Inlet and Mackenzie Delta sediments (comprising 24% and 16% of this pool, respectively), likely reflecting episodic transport of OC from steep hillside slopes surrounding Saanich Inlet and annual spring flood deposition in the Mackenzie Delta, respectively. Contributions of 5-10 year old OC to the Cariaco Basin show a short delay of OC inflow, potentially related to transport time to the offshore basin. Modeling results also indicate that the Mackenzie Delta has an influx of young but decadal material (20-30 years of age), pointing to the presence of an intermediate reservoir. Overall, these results show that a significant fraction of vascular plant C undergoes pre-aging in terrestrial reservoirs prior to accumulation in deltaic and marine sediments. The age distribution, reflecting both storage and transport times, likely depends on landscape-specific factors such as local topography, hydrographic characteristics, and mean annual temperature of the catchment, all of which affect the degree of soil buildup and preservation. We show that catchment-specific carbon residence times across landscapes can vary by an order of magnitude, with important implications both for carbon cycle studies and for the interpretation of molecular terrestrial paleoclimate records preserved in sedimentary sequences.

265,"Temporal and spatial trends of lake acidity in northern Sweden | Changes in lake-water pH, alkalinity and colour were inferred from diatoms in surface sediment samples and sediment samples from pre-industrial times from 118 northern Swedish lakes. This palaeolimnological study does not support the hypothesis that there is a large-scale modern acidification in the two northernmost counties of Sweden; pH had decreased significantly in eight lakes, while five had a significant increase. Partial least-squares regression of changes in water chemistry in relation to catchment characteristics was performed to evaluate the causes of the acidity status. Furthermore, temporal trends were assessed from long sediment cores from five acidic lakes. The results suggest that the presently acid lakes have faced a long-term acidification trend over several thousand years due to soil-forming processes and vegetation development. However, due to the acid sensitivity of the region, future acidification trends in northern Swedish lakes should be carefully observed and assessed. | ['korsman'] | ",['korsman'],2
266,"Tephra Layers in a Sediment Core from Lake Hestvatn, Southern Iceland: Implications for Evaluating Sedimentation Processes and Environmental Impacts on a Lacustrine System Caused by Tephra Fall Deposits in the Surrounding Watershed | A 570 cm sediment core (94-HV01) from Lake Hestvatn in southern Iceland records continuous lacustrine deposition over the last 6200 yr, including numerous layers of primary fallout tephra. Significant downcore changes are observed in sediment magnetic, chemical and sedimentological characteristics of the deposit, and four zones are identified based primarily on changes in sediment magnetic properties that are supported by chemical analyses. Zone I (3830-6200 14C yr BP) is characterized by low sediment flux, low concentrations of magnetic and chemical substances, and high amounts of biogenic silica, and reflects a period of high productivity in the lake and minimal erosion in the watershed. However, an increase in magnetic and chemical concentrations in the uppermost part of the zone suggests increased erosion within the watershed that is possibly caused by a slight change in vegetation composition towards the end of this period. Zone II (2180-3830 14C yr BP) is identified by an abrupt increase in sediment flux into the lake and greatly increased concentrations of magnetic and chemical substances. This change coincides with a shift in vegetation composition within the watershed that is possibly caused by lower temperatures and/or increased precipitation, as well as in conjunction with the deposition of the H4 tephra and subsequent less voluminous tephra layers. Zone III (1180-2180 14C yr BP) is marked by low concentrations of magnetic and chemical materials and relatively low sedimentation rates as a result of less frequent deposition of fallout tephra into the watershed and less erosion, possibly caused by a slight change in composition of vegetation cover. Zone IV (present-1180 14C yr BP) is characterized by a sudden increase in sedimentation rates and high concentrations of magnetic and chemical materials, and reflects an increase in surface erosion within the watershed following the settlement of Iceland. Seventy-three tephra layers are identified in the Lake Hestvatn sediment core (94-HV01). The Katla and Hekla volcanoes are the source of most of the tephra layers in the core, although tephra layers representing the Vestmannaeyjar, Veidiv√∂tn and Gr√≠msv√∂tn volcanoes are also present. These tephra layers represent fallout ash deposited directly into the lake along with subsequent contributions from reworking of tephra within the lacustrine and terrestrial environment. On the basis of major and trace element concentration profiles across the Hekla 4 (H4) and Katla N (KN) tephra layers and adjacent sediment, we show that the influx of tephra particles decreased to pre-eruption values, 66 and 90 yr after the initial tephra deposition. This study indicates that in regions such as southern Iceland, where eruptions that produce great amounts of tephra are frequent, the effects of tephra deposition on lacustrine systems have to be evaluated before other environmental proxies (e.g. pollen and diatoms) in lake sediments can be interpreted accurately. ¬© 2001 by Blackwell Science Ltd.

267,"Terrestrial plant macrofossil records; possible indicators of past lake-level fluctuations in north-eastern European Russia and Finnish Lapland? | Four lake-sediment sequences from north-eastern European Russia and one from Finnish Lapland were studied for plant macrofossils. Basal ages of sediment sequences varied between ca. 12 800 and 6000 radiocarbon years. Plant macrofossil records of terrestrial and telmatic taxa showed a clear declining trend in terrestrial species richness and the relative amount of remains from mid to late Holocene. When these data are examined together with evidence provided by other available proxies (Cladocera, diatom, pollen, chironomid, lithology, LOI), it seems that the declining trend, in addition to reflecting the general vegetation development (e.g. shifts in treelines), might also reflect a change in the distance between the sampling point and the shoreline, i.e. changes in past lake levels. Variations detected in the species richness and abundance records are discussed against previous climate reconstructions available from nearby areas. | ['valiranta'] | ",['valiranta'],2
268,"Testate amoebae and the fossil record: Issues in biodiversity | Biodiversity assessment is broadly divided into a consideration of species diversity, genetic diversity and ecosystem diversity. Individual species are readily defined for many groups of organisms and their relationship with fossil taxa found in the Late Quaternary is clear. Testate amoebae are a group of protozoa which form external tests that are preserved in peat and lake sediments. The higher taxa levels are defined by the morphology of the soft pseudopodia which are not preserved in fossil specimens but many lower taxa can be recognized by test characteristics. Two sets of problems occur in the assessment of fossil testate amoebae biodiversity, related to species definitions based on morphological criteria in living specimens, and the preservation and study of fossil tests. The biological species concept cannot be readily applied to testate amoebae and morphospecies are therefore defined on the basis of the characteristics of pseudopodia and tests. However, the accepted degree of intraspecific morphological variation appears to be variable between authorities and the number of described species is therefore poorly defined. In addition, there is likely to be no straightforward relationship between species diversity and genetic diversity. Further problems of species differentiation are encountered in fossil specimens so that the assessment of biodiversity in fossil populations is even more problematic. The variable results which can be obtained by the adoption of different sets of species definitions are illustrated with respect to fossil faunas from peat profiles in Canada and the UK. The biodiversity of living testate amoebae and other groups of lower organisms is poorly known and further consideration needs to be given to the definition and description of both living and fossil specimens if these problems are to be resolved. The assessment of complete ecosystem biodiversity is not possible without this and investigations which consider the role of diversity in ecosystem functioning cannot even begin. | ['charman'] | ",['charman'],2

270,"Tracking late-Quaternary extinctions in interior Alaska using megaherbivore bone remains and dung fungal spores | One major challenge in the study of late-Quaternary extinctions (LQEs) is providing better estimates of past megafauna abundance. To show how megaherbivore population size varied before and after the last extinctions in interior Alaska, we use both a database of radiocarbon-dated bone remains (spanning 25-0 ka) and spores of the obligate dung fungus,Sporormiella,recovered from radiocarbon-dated lake-sediment cores (spanning 17-0 ka). Bone fossils show that the last stage of LQEs in the region occurred at about 13 ka ago, but the number of megaherbivore bones remains high into the Holocene.Sporormiellaabundance also remains high into the Holocene and does not decrease with major vegetation changes recorded by arboreal pollen percentages. At two sites, the interpretation ofSporormiellawas enhanced by additional dung fungal spore types (e.g.,Sordaria). In contrast to many sites where the last stage of LQEs is marked by a sharp decline inSporormiellaabundance, in interior Alaska our results indicate the continuance of megaherbivore abundance, albeit with a major taxonomic turnover (includingMammuthusandEquusextinction) from predominantly grazing to browsing dietary guilds. This new and robust evidence implies that regional LQEs were not systematically associated with crashes of overall megaherbivore abundance. | ['baker', 'collier', 'conroy', 'edward', 'hopla', 'jones', 'lister', 'van', 'hardenbroek'] | ","['baker', 'collier', 'conroy', 'edward', 'hopla', 'jones', 'lister', 'van', 'hardenbroek']",1
271,"Trends in development of diatom flora from sub-recent lake sediments of the Lake Bolshoy Kharbey (Bolshezemelskaya tundra, Russia) | We studied diatom assemblages of the proglacial arctic lake Bolshoy Kharbey (Bolshezemelskaya tundra, Russian Arctic) from a short sediments core covering the last ca. 200 years. In total, 121 taxa from 2 classes, 5 orders, 18 families, and 50 genera were identified. The diatom flora included species with mainly cosmopolitan distribution. The assemblages were dominated by alkaliphilic benthic diatoms preferring standing - flowing waters, indifferent to salinity and moderate temperature conditions. The main changes in diatom assemblages took place in ca. 1870 and 1980. After 1870, which can be attributed to the end of the Little Ice Age, the species richness rose, especially of planktonic centric and small penate diatoms. This rise of diatom diversity took place most probably in response to climate warming, related to it prolongation of the growing season and period of open water. A negative trend in the evenness of the diatom assemblages during the last decades can be seen as an early-warning signal indicating a decrease of stability of the lake ecosystem. | ['frolova', 'nazarova', 'palagushkina'] | ","['frolova', 'nazarova', 'palagushkina']",4
272,"Utility of salt-marsh foraminifera, testate amoebae and bulk-sediment delta C-13 values as sea-level indicators in Newfoundland, Canada | We investigated the utility of foraminifera, testate amoebae and bulk-sediment delta C-13 measurements for reconstructing Holocene relative sea level from sequences of salt-marsh sediment in Newfoundland, Canada. Modern, surface sediment was collected along transects from low to supra-tidal elevations in eastern (at Placentia) and western (at Hynes Brook and Big River) Newfoundland. Consistent with previous work, low-diversity assemblages of foraminifera display an almost binary division into a higher salt-marsh assemblage dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens and a lower salt-marsh assemblage comprised of Miliammina fusca. This pattern and composition resembles those identified at other high latitude sites with cool climates and confirms that foraminifera are sea-level indicators. The lowest occurrence of testate amoebae was at approximately mean higher high water. The composition of high salt-marsh testate amoebae assemblages (Centropyxis cassis type, Trinema spp., Tracheleuglypha dentata type, and Euglypha spp.) in Newfoundland was similar to elsewhere in the North Atlantic, but preservation bias favors removal of species with idiosomic tests over those with xenosomic tests. The mixed high salt-marsh plant community in Newfoundland results in bulk surface-sediment delta C-13 values that are typical of C-3 plants, making them indistinguishable from freshwater sediment. Therefore we propose that the utility of this proxy for reconstructing RSL in eastern North America is restricted to the coastline between Chesapeake Bay and southern Nova Scotia. Using a simple, multi-proxy approach to establish that samples in three radiocarbon-dated sediment cores formed between the lowest occurrence of testate amoebae and the highest occurrence of foraminifera, we generated three example late Holocene sea-level index points at Hynes Brook.

274,"Varved marine sediments | Annually laminated (varved) sediments are valuable tools for research in geochronology, as well as other disciplines including paleoclimatology, paleoseismology, and archeology. Varved sediments are formed when distinct layers of sediment are deposited during different seasons throughout the year. These layers can be counted and measured, similar to tree rings, in order to provide accurate calendar age chronologies. Varve chronologies can be used in geochronological research in order to study and develop sediment dating techniques such as 210Pb and 14C, and to date single events such as earthquakes and turbidity currents. Varves can also be applied to the reconstruction of past environmental conditions. At a minimum, varves provide annual-resolution calendar age models for records based on other climate proxies (stable isotopes, pollen, etc.). However, in the best cases, varves themselves can be shown to contain environmental information, and thus combine high temporal precision with accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the same archive. Varved sediments occur in a wide variety of environments from all over the globe. They are found in diverse settings from alpine glaciers and coastal tidewater lakes to isolated marine basins and continental slopes, and occur at all latitudes from the high Arctic to the tropics. Varves were first investigated as a dating tool by De Geer (1912), who used laminated glacial marine clays off Sweden to construct a geochronology of the last deglaciation. Since that time, the application of varved sediment studies to Earth sciences has expanded greatly, and investigative techniques have become more refined. This article will provide an introduction to varved sediments, describing the most common types and how they form, methods of analysis and chronology construction, and examples of applications to current research. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The taxonomic and stratigraphic structure of the column of bottom sediments is reflected in a spore-pollen diagram which was divided on the 4 biostratigraphic sequences - pollen zones (PZ I-IV). The results show that the bottom of the core (PZ I) was deposited in wetter conditions. At the time moss (Sphagnum) and low-growing shrubs (Betula spp., Salix, Alnaster) with the presence of heather (Ericaceae) communities dominated in the catchment area. The climate at this time was humid. The middle layers of the core (PZ II-PZ III) show a decrease in moisture content of the territory. There was the aridity of the climate. Compared with the previous pollen zone, the total content of pollen of herbaceous taxa (Ericaceae, Artemisia, Rubus chamaemorus, Amaranthaceae, Brassicaceae and others) increased in pollen zone II and III. The last pollen zone (PZ IV) is characterized by an increase in moisture content of the territory. A re-development of moss and low-growing shrubs with the presence of heather communities was observed in the catchment area of Lake Arcto-Pimberto.

At Tugtuligssuaq, the vegetation invading the deglaciated soil around 8500 BP was a species-rich pioneer vegetation, dominated by Poaceae, Oxyria digyna and other herbs. The first dwarf-shrubs, Empetrum hermaphroditum and Vaccinium uliginosum, immigrated in the following centuries, followed by Cassiope tetragona. By 6700 BP Salix arctica and S. herbacea immigrated. These species together with Cyperaceae, later on Cassiope, dominate the pollen spectra until c2300 BP. The influx of long-distance pollen indicating more frequent SW winds, increased around 5000 BP and remained at a high level until a marked decrease is seen c2300 BP. Cassiope dominates in the recent PV zone. The lakes were fairly rich in the first millennia with high production of Pediastrum and Botryococcus. Colymbetes dolabratus and Gasterosteus aculeatus, both north of their present distribution limit, lived in the lakes at an early stage. Qeqertat has a more continental climate. The cored lake was not isolated from the sea until 6800 BP, just prior to the immigration of S. arctica. Cyperaceae dominate the pollen diagram until around 3500 BP when Cassiope and especially S. arctica become more frequent. -from Author | ['fredskild'] | ",['fredskild'],4
278,"Wetland development, permafrost history and nutrient cycling inferred from late Holocene peat and lake sediment records in subarctic Sweden | Permafrost in peatlands of subarctic Sweden is presently thawing at accelerated rates, which raises questions about the destiny of stored carbon and nutrients and impacts on adjacent freshwater ecosystems. In this study we use peat and lake sediment records from the Stordalen palsa mire in northern Sweden to address the late Holocene (5,000 cal BP-present) development of the mire as well as related changes in carbon and nutrient cycling. Formation, sediment accumulation and biogeochemistry of two studied lakes are suggested to be largely controlled by the development of the mire and its permafrost dynamics. Peat inception took place at ca. 4,700 cal BP as a result of terrestrialisation. Onset of organic sedimentation in the adjacent lakes occurred at ca. 3,400 and 2,650 cal BP in response to mire expansion and permafrost aggradation, respectively. Mire erosion, possibly due to permafrost decay, led to re-deposition of peat into one of the lakes after ca. 2,100 cal BP, and stimulated primary productivity in the other lake at ca. 1,900-1,800 cal BP. Carbonate precipitation appears to have been suppressed when acidic poor fen and bog (palsa) communities dominated the catchment mire, and permafrost-induced changes in hydrology may further have affected the inflow of alkaline water from the catchment. Elevated contents of biogenic silica and diatom pigments in lake sediments during periods of poor fen and bog expansion further indicate that terrestrial vegetation influenced the amount of nutrients entering the lake. Increased productivity in the lake likely caused bottom-water anoxia in the downstream lake and led to recycling of sediment phosphorous, bringing the lake into a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries preceding the onset of twentieth century permafrost thaw. Our results give insight into nutrient and permafrost dynamics in a subarctic wetland and imply that continued permafrost decay and related vegetation changes towards minerotrophy may increase carbon and nutrient storage of mire deposits and reduce nutrient fluxes in runoff. Rapid permafrost degradation may on the other hand lead to widespread mire erosion and to relatively short periods of significantly increased nutrient loading in adjacent lakes. | ['hammarlund', 'kokfelt', 'reuss', 'rosen', 'rundgren', 'skog', 'sonesson', 'struyf'] | ","['hammarlund', 'kokfelt', 'reuss', 'rosen', 'rundgren', 'skog', 'sonesson', 'struyf']",2

2,"Out of America: Ancient DNA evidence for a new world origin of late quaternary woolly mammoths | Although the iconic mammoth of the Late Pleistocene, the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), has traditionally been regarded as the end point of a single anagenetically evolving lineage, recent paleontological and molecular studies have shown that successive allopatric speciation events must have occurred within Pleistocene Mammuthus in Asia, with subsequent expansion and hybridization between nominal taxa [1, 2]. However, the role of North American mammoth populations in these events has not been adequately explored from an ancient-DNA standpoint. To undertake this task, we analyzed mtDNA from a large data set consisting of mammoth samples from across Holarctica (n = 160) and representing most of radiocarbon time. Our evidence shows that, during the terminal Pleistocene, haplotypes originating in and characteristic of New World populations replaced or succeeded those endemic to Asia and western Beringia. Also, during the Last Glacial Maximum, mammoth populations do not appear to have suffered an overall decline in diversity, despite differing responses on either side of the Bering land bridge. In summary, the ""Out-of-America"" hypothesis holds that the dispersal of North American woolly mammoths into other parts of Holarctica created major phylogeographic structuring within Mammuthus primigenius populations, shaping the last phase of their evolutionary history before their demise. | ['bos', 'buigues', 'chu', 'debruyne', 'fisher', 'flemming', 'froese', 'grocke', 'guthrie', 'king', 'kuch', 'macphee', 'matheus', 'poinar', 'poinar', 'schwarz', 'southon', 'szpak', 'tikhonov', 'zazula', 'de', 'marliave'] | ","['bos', 'buigues', 'chu', 'debruyne', 'fisher', 'flemming', 'froese', 'grocke', 'guthrie', 'king', 'kuch', 'macphee', 'matheus', 'poinar', 'poinar', 'schwarz', 'southon', 'szpak', 'tikhonov', 'zazula', 'de', 'marliave']",4

4,"Ancient DNA reveals a major genetic change during the transition from hunting economy to reindeer husbandry in northern Scandinavia | The timing and origin of reindeer domestication has been highly debated. Recent molecular analyses show several mitochondrial lineages of domestic reindeer across Eurasia suggesting different origins of Fennoscandian and Siberian domestic reindeer. In order to investigate the origin of domestic Fennoscandian reindeer, we sequenced a mitochondrial control region fragment of 68 ancient reindeer remains from archaeological sites in Finnmark, the major county for extant reindeer husbandry in Norway, spanning from ca. BC 3400 to AD 1800. The majority of the Stone and Iron Age reindeer assemblages in Finnmark are from settlements in the eastern part of the county, in the Varangerfjord area. The reindeer remains from these settlements show affiliation to the large and complex Beringian haplotype cluster, found in extant reindeer from the Kola Peninsula to north-eastern Russia. A distinct haplotype shift is observed in the late medieval period, when the typical haplotype signatures of extant domestic Fennoscandian reindeer appeared in coastal regions of both eastern and western Finnmark. These haplotypes were not found among the Stone and Iron Age wild reindeer samples of Finnmark, suggesting that this population was not ancestral to extant domestic reindeer of Fennoscandia.

Group I is characterized by the presence of American-East Asian and American-Mediterranean-Asian genera: prenemoral flora with similar composition throughout the continent. Group II is characterized by the presence of the only group of genera which is absent in the modern flora of the region: protonemoral flora in Europe and the Far East with American-Mediterranean-Asian genera and quaiboreal in Siberia and Kamchatka with American-Euro-Asian genera. Group III is characterized by the total absence of the genera which are not represented in the modern local flora: nemoral in Europe and the Far East and boreal in Siberia and Kamchatka. The stratigraphic position of the prenemoral flora corresponds to the Lower Pleistocene and the Upper Pliocene. Paleomagnetic evidence of the Ural and Middle Asia indicates that the prenemoral flora existed during the Matuyama epoch. The protonemoral flora in Europe and the Far East corresponds to the Middle Pleistocene interglacials. Nemoral and boreal floras correspond to the Upper Pleistocene and Holocene.

13,"Bison phylogeography constrains dispersal and viability of the Ice Free Corridor in western Canada | The Ice Free Corridor has been invoked as a route for Pleistocene human and animal dispersals between eastern Beringia and more southerly areas of North America. Despite the significance of the corridor, there are limited data for when and how this corridor was used. Hypothetical uses of the corridor include: the first expansion of humans from Beringia into the Americas, northward postglacial expansions of fluted point technologies into Beringia, and continued use of the corridor as a contact route between the north and south. Here, we use radiocarbon dates and ancient mitochondrial DNA from late Pleistocene bison fossils to determine the chronology for when the corridor was open and viable for biotic dispersals. The corridor was closed after similar to 23,000 until 13,400 calendar years ago (cal y BP), after which we find the first evidence, to our knowledge, that bison used this route to disperse from the south, and by 13,000 y from the north. Our chronology supports a habitable and traversable corridor by at least 13,000 cal y BP, just before the first appearance of Clovis technology in interior North America, and indicates that the corridor would not have been available for significantly earlier southward human dispersal. Following the opening of the corridor, multiple dispersals of human groups between Beringia and interior North America may have continued throughout the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. Our results highlight the utility of phylogeographic analyses to test hypotheses about paleoecological history and the viability of dispersal routes over time. | ['andrew', 'driver', 'froese', 'hall', 'hare', 'heintzman', 'ives', 'jass', 'letts', 'mackay', 'shapiro', 'soares', 'southon', 'stiller', 'suchard', 'woywitka', 'zazula'] | ","['andrew', 'driver', 'froese', 'hall', 'hare', 'heintzman', 'ives', 'jass', 'letts', 'mackay', 'shapiro', 'soares', 'southon', 'stiller', 'suchard', 'woywitka', 'zazula']",0
14,"Carnivores (Mammalia, Carnivora) of the Urals in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene | Carnivore assemblages from localities of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene of Northern, Middle and Southern Urals were studied. Analysis of species composition of the carnivore fauna was performed for seven chronological periods: MIS 5e, MIS 3, mid-MIS2 (LGT), late MIS 2 (BAIC), early MIS 1 (Preboreal-Boreal), mid-MIS 1 (Atlantic-Subboreal), late MIS 1 (Subatlantic). In the Urals, changes in carnivore fauna were occurring during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Faunal composition included the species from European, Siberian and European Siberian faunal complexes throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, dominated by the species from European Siberian faunal complexes. The general trend of fauna changes is represented by a decreasing percentage of species from the European faunal complex and an increasing percentage of those from the Siberian faunal complex. Faunal composition has changed due to two main reasons, range shifts and extinction. Sixteen out of 24 species that inhabited the Urals during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene underwent range shifts. The ranges shifted in different directions: reduction, increased and fluctuations. The ranges of several species have not changed. Three species became extinct. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Despite the abundant material available for study, there is still considerable disagreement over the number of species of Equus that inhabited the different regions of the continent and on their taxonomic nomenclature. In this study, we investigated cheek tooth morphology and ancient mtDNA of late Pleistocene Equus specimens from the Western Interior of North America, with the objective of clarifying the species that lived in this region prior to the end-Pleistocene extinction. Based on the morphological and molecular data analyzed, a caballine (Equus ferus) and a non-caballine (E. conversidens) species were identified from different localities across most of the Western Interior. A second non-caballine species (E. cedralensis) was recognized from southern localities based exclusively on the morphological analyses of the cheek teeth. Notably the separation into caballine and non-caballine species was observed in the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of ancient mtDNA as well as in the geometric morphometric analyses of the upper and lower premolars.

17,"Collection of radiocarbon dates on the mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) and other genera of Wrangel Island, northeast Siberia, Russia | We present and discuss a full list of radiocarbon dates for woolly mammoth and other species of the Mammoth fauna available from Wrangel Island, northeast Siberia, Russia. Most of the radiocarbon dates are published here for the first time. Of the 124 radiocarbon dates on mammoth bone, 106 fall between 3700 and 9000 yr ago. We believe these dates bracket the period of mammoth isolation oil Wrangel Island and their ultimate extinction, which we attribute to natural causes. The absence of dates between 9-12 ka probably indicates a period when mammoths were absent from Wrangel Island. Long bone dimensions of Holocene mammoths from Wrangel Island indicate that these animals were comparable in size to those on the mainland, although they were not large animals, neither can they be classified as dwarfs. Occurrence of mammoth Holocene refugia on the mainland is suggested. Based on other species of the Mammoth fauna that have also been radiocarbon on Wrangel Island, including horse, bison, musk ox and woolly rhinoceros, it appears that the mammoth was the only species of that fauna that inhabited Wrangel Island in the mid-Holocene.

19,"A contribution to the discussion of biota dispersal with drift ice and driftwood in the North Atlantic | Aim: The present work aims to review the early proposed hypothesis of biota dispersal by driftwood and drift ice. Location: The North Atlantic region. Methods: New knowledge gained about drift ice patterns and sources and transport routes of ice-rafted debris and dendrochronologically dated driftwood is used to investigate chance dispersal of diaspores. In addition, the extremely disjunct distribution patterns of some vascular plants in Scandinavia and East Greenland are examined in the light of this new data. Results: Both drift ice and driftwood are thought to be important in the chance dispersal of diaspores from Siberia and North-west Russia to parts of the North Atlantic region, in the Late Weichselian or early Holocene. It is proposed that the extremely disjunct distribution of some vascular plants in northern Scandinavia and East Greenland (e.g. Draba sibirica, Oxytropis deflexa ssp. norvegica, Potentilla stipularis and Trisetum subalpestre) are examples of this type of long-distance dispersal. Main conclusions: The concentration of extremely disjunct distributed vascular plant species in parts of northern Norway and East Greenland is suggested to relate to the Late Weichselian ice free conditions and the topography and exposure of the coastline in these areas, allowing accumulation of ice-rafted debris and driftwood. A systematic survey of debris samples obtained from drift ice and driftwood trees is needed to evaluate the significance of these vectors for dispersal of biota to the North Atlantic region. | ['hytteborn', 'johansen'] | ","['hytteborn', 'johansen']",0

22,"AMS-dated late Pleistocene taiga vole (Rodentia : Microtus xanthognathus) from northeast British Columbia, Canada: a cautionary lesson in chronology | Dissected colluvial sediments on a Peace River terrace at Bear Flat, northeast British Columbia enclosed a late Pleistocene micromammalian faunule. The fossil remains, including a few loosely articulated skulls and mandibles, were dominated by taiga voles (Microtus xanthognathus). The Bear Flat site constitutes the second fossil occurrence in the region of this elusive species, which is unknown in British Columbia in historic times. The late Pleistocene age, determined by accelerator mass spectrometry directly on taiga vole bone collagen, is consistent with the ages of widespread taiga vole records peripheral to the Laurentide ice sheet in western, mid-western, and eastern North America. The presence of allo-chronous remains within a comprehensively dated sedimentary sequence provides a cautionary note about straightforward acceptance of relative stratigraphic dating. | ['burn', 'geertsema', 'hebda', 'jull'] | ","['burn', 'geertsema', 'hebda', 'jull']",0

26,"Past distributions of the European freshwater eel from archaeological and palaeontological evidence | The spatial distribution of the European freshwater eel (Anguilla anguilla) was very different in historic and prehistoric times in comparison to the present. A database of the spatial and temporal distribution of eel remains in archaeological and palaeontological sites is presented and used to assess the spatial distribution of populations from the height of the last glacial maximum. The results show that the eel was absent from northern Europe until about 11000 years ago. The reason was probably a southerly displacement of the Gulf Stream carrying the larval migration from the Sargasso Sea. However, additional factors preventing eel populations in northern Europe may have also been the colder temperatures in the Arctic tundra landscape that existed at the time and the extreme distance to the European Atlantic coast along the Channel River. The archaeological record shows that eels were absent from the Baltic Sea until about 6700 cal BC, but there is some indication of an earlier presence during the Yoldia Sea stage at the beginning of the Holocene. Only in southern Europe south of the Gironde river basin were eel populations maintained through the last glaciation. The species may have survived the last glaciation in a relatively restricted area in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of western Europe. Published palaeontological and genetic information gives important insights into climatic, geologic, and tectonic events on longer time scales. The oldest subfossil remains from Pleistocene sediments in northern Europe are approaching the age of the estimated genetic divergence of the European and American eel populations, and hence the species identity of the oldest subfossil remains may be ambiguous.

During the Pleistocene, it was widely distributed in Eurasia and North America. To evaluate its morphological variability through time and space, we conducted an extensive morphometric study of 217 Praeovibos and Ovibos skull remains. The analyses showed that the skulls grew progressively wider from Praeovibos sp. to the Pleistocene O. moschatus, while from the Pleistocene to the recent O. moschatus, the facial regions of the skull turned narrower and shorter. We also noticed significant geographic differences between the various Pleistocene Ovibos crania. Siberian skulls were usually larger than those from Western and Central Europe. Eastern European muskoxen also exceeded in size those from the other regions of Europe. The large size of Late Pleistocene muskoxen from regions located in more continental climatic regimes was probably associated with the presence of more suitable food resources in steppe-tundra settings. Consistently, radiocarbon-dated records of this species are more numerous in colder periods, when the steppe-tundra was widely spread, and less abundant in warmer periods. | ['baryshnikov', 'boeskorov', 'cyrek', 'czyzewski', 'gagat', 'jakubowski', 'kotowski', 'kovalchuk', 'krajcarz', 'krajcarz', 'krakhmalnaya', 'lipecki', 'mackiewicz', 'malikov', 'nadachowski', 'nikolskiy', 'pawlowska', 'ratajczak', 'ridush', 'roblickova', 'semba', 'shpansky', 'stefaniak', 'sudol', 'procyk', 'wojtal', 'zeromska'] | ","['baryshnikov', 'boeskorov', 'cyrek', 'czyzewski', 'gagat', 'jakubowski', 'kotowski', 'kovalchuk', 'krajcarz', 'krajcarz', 'krakhmalnaya', 'lipecki', 'mackiewicz', 'malikov', 'nadachowski', 'nikolskiy', 'pawlowska', 'ratajczak', 'ridush', 'roblickova', 'semba', 'shpansky', 'stefaniak', 'sudol', 'procyk', 'wojtal', 'zeromska']",1

An approximate estimation of the relative sea level change and the relative vertical movements of the coast is given.

The north-eastern coast of the Bay (the Zimniy Coast) underwent relative elevation at a rate of about 0.2-0.5 mm/year, less than the Letniy Coast, which cannot be explained only by glacioisostasy. The Severnaya Dvina river delta was relatively stable.

The mountain reindeer may be descended from the European Pleistocene reindeer, and may have migrated into northern Finland via the west coast of Norway. The forest reindeer invaded Finland directly from the east, from its glacial refugia in Siberia.

35,"Early maritime traditions in the Bering, Chukchi and East Siberian Seas | In Alaska, the Cape Denbigh site on Norton Sound provides the earliest archaeological evidence for a maritime adaptation in the northern Bering Sea. Here, as at Cape Krusenstern on the eastern coast of the Chukchi Sea, interior caribou hunters with an Arctic Small Tool tradition (Denbigh Flint complex-4700-3500 BP) tool kit came to the coast to hunt seal in the near-shore zone during the spring to early summer months. By 3200 BP there is stronger evidence for a maritime adaptation (hunting of walrus, polar bears, seals, and possibly whales) from the Devil's Gorge site on Wrangel Island and the Old Whaling complex on beach ridge 53 at Cape Krusenstern. The following Choris and Norton phases (3000-2000 BP) reflect a return to mixed maritime and terrestrial subsistence with heavy emphasis on caribou and near-shore hunting of seal and walrus. During Norton times large villages arose as a consequence of abundant fish harvests from the rivers of southwestern Alaska. Cultural intensification during the Norton phase set the stage for development of a full-scale maritime adaptation in the Bering-Chukchi-East Siberian seas as reflected in the Old Bering Sea/Okvik, Punuk/Birnirk, and Thule phases of Eskimo prehistory. Recent evidence from a site on Zhokov Island in the East Siberian Sea indicates greater time depth for maritime adaptation than recorded archaeologically for the Bering and Chukchi seas. Around 8000 BP, hunters with a Mesolithic tool kit lived along the edge of the Arctic Ocean, pursuing reindeer, polar bears, and the occasional seal and walrus. | ['ackerman'] | ",['ackerman'],1
36,"The Early and Middle Weichselian in Norway: a review | All Known sites with fossils and ‚Äònon‚Äêtill sediments‚Äô of possible Early and Middle Weichselian age in Norway are discussed. Along the west coast there are many sites marine shells which have been dated by means of radiocarbon, amino acids and thorium/uranium methods. Some sites are also correlated by means of underlying Eemian sequences. A tentative glaciation curve for western Norway indicates a first glacial advance soon after the end of the Eemian. There are indications of another re‚Äêadvance around 40,000 B.P., and the Late Weichselian maximum (maxima?) occurred somewhere between 30,000 B.P. and 13,000 B.P. Parts of the coast may have been ice‚Äêfree for most of the remaining periods. From the central parts of the country are known bones (e.g. mammoth), glaciolacustrine and fluvial sediments, peat, etc. The newly discovered site with peat of Brumunddal can very probably be correlated with the J√§mtland Interstadial in Sweden, and the Br√∏rup Interstadial in Denmark.

37,"An Early Holocene Narwhal Tusk from the Canadian High Arctic | A narwhal (Monodon monoceros) tusk from 34 m above sea level and located at 82.degree. N on the northwest coast of Ellesmere Island has been radiocarbon dated at 6,830 .+-. 50 B.P. It was collected from a narrow coastal strip which is isolated from the adjacent Arctic Ocean by glacier ice, ice shelf and multiyear pack ice. The specimen represents an early Holocene range extension of 400-700 km over the present. Because the narwhal requires abundant open water to survive, the Holocene tusk is an important independent item of proxy data on palaeoclimatiac change. Contemporary migration routes are directly related to seasonal sea ice in the inter-island channels of the central Canadian Arctic archipelago. The presence of a narwhal on the northwest Ellesmere Island coast at 6,830 .+-. 50 B.P. suggests that sea ice and ice-shelf conditions were more favourable at that time. A comprehensive chronological framework for late Quaternary and Holocene geomorphic/climatic events from northern Ellesmere Island records a warm early Holocene characterized by abundant driftwood entry into the high Arctic. This was followed by a mid-Holocene climatic deterioration during which the ice shelves of the Ellemere coast formed. Therefore, the narwhal tusk is further evidence that a period of maximum postglacial warmth occurred during the early Holocene in the Canadian high Arctic. | ['evans'] | ",['evans'],4

39,"Holocene Ecohydrological Variability on the East Coast of Kamchatka | The Late Glacial and Holocene climate of the western North Pacific is less studied than that of the eastern North Pacific. While it is well known that strong east-west gradients in the tropical Pacific Ocean influence terrestrial climate, we seek to better understand how these gradients are expressed in the northern extratropics. Toward this aim, we present an organic and stable isotope geochemical and macrofossil record from a peatland on the east coast of the Kamchatka peninsula. We find that both the early and late Holocene were wetter, with a different assemblage of plants from the middle Holocene, which was drier, with more episodic precipitation. The large ecohydrological changes at several points during the Holocene are contemporaneous with and of the same sense as those we find at places to the east, such as south-central Alaska and to the south, in northern Japan. We also find that the middle Holocene period of warmth, dryness and low carbon accumulation occur contemporaneously with an enhanced east-west gradient in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature. This suggests that that hydroclimatic conditions in the subarctic can be influenced by tropical dynamics. | ['andreev', 'nichols', 'ogus', 'peteet', 'stute'] | ","['andreev', 'nichols', 'ogus', 'peteet', 'stute']",0

41,"Environmental context of Pleistocene peopling of the Central Urals | The broader territory of the Urals has principal significance for elucidating the historical processes and environmental contexts of the Pleistocene expansion of people from the south-eastern parts of Europe into West Siberia and the northern Russian Arctic regions. Interaction of past climate change and the regional topographic modelling triggered by neotectonic activity reflected by pronounced natural transformations attest to the complexity of the Quaternary development in the Central Urals, affecting timing and intensity of the earliest human occupation of this territory. The initial peopling of the western (Fore-Ural) area is associated with the Early Palaeolithic dispersal into the marginal East European Plain, probably during some climatically favourable Middle Pleistocene interglacials. The Chusoaya River valley transecting the Central Ural Mountain range was one of the main geographic corridors for the subsequent Middle and Upper Palaeolithic migrations into the eastern (Trans-Ural) regions of West Siberia. A long-term behavioural adjustment to cold periglacial habitats is linked to progressive cultural and biological evolution during the Late Pleistocene. The north-central Trans-Urals Upper Palaeolithic Complex in the Sosva River basin with open occupation sites based on ""mammoth fauna"" exploitation indicates adaptation to sub-polar tundra-steppe environments of the West Siberian Plain during the last glacial stage. Geoarchaeological records provide further insights into the timing and ecology conditions of the Pleistocene colonisation of north-central Eurasia. The present study summarises the current evidence on trajectories of the Pleistocene environmental development in the broader Central Urals, still a marginally investigated geographical area of Eurasia.

42,"The environmental setting for human colonization of northern New England and adjacent Canada in Late Pleistocene time | Human inhabitants encountered a series of changing environments at the end of the most recent ice age in northern New England. We present our current understanding of the context of colonization of this area by a diversity of human groups some time between 13,000 B.P. and 11,000 B.P., based on archeological evidence and on geological and biological evidence synthesized by Davis and Jacobson (1985). As the Champlain Sea separated the main body of Laurentide ice from the ice cover of northern New England and the Canadian Maritimes about 13,000 B.P., plants and animals began to invade land surfaces exposed by the dissipating ice sheet. Over a few thousand years, the vegetation changed from tundra to woodland to closed forest. There is little direct paleontological evidence for the fauna that lived in those late-glacial ecosystems, but human artifacts from several sites indicate that large mammals were probably hunted prior to the late-Pleistocene extinction of megafauna. We suggest that a shift to greater reliance on caribou hunting would have followed the extinctions. We present a speculative model of how humans adapted to the changing environments and food sources during that dynamic period. | ['bonnichsen', 'born', 'jr', 'davis', 'jacobson', 'jr'] | ","['bonnichsen', 'born', 'jr', 'davis', 'jacobson', 'jr']",4

44,"The Eurasian mammoth distribution during the second half of the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene: Regional aspects | Based on geographic information (database PALEOFAUNA), in combination with C-14 and other methods of paleo dating (1584 localities, 4033 dates, including 1501 direct dates), we first examined details of changes of mammoth distribution in Eurasia on the whole and in single parts of the range over the last 50ky. The analysis of regional features in the dynamics of mammoth range and the quantity of dated localities acknowledged a leading role of the climatic (environmental) factor in these processes. The maximum size of the Eurasian range, the largest number of remains of mammoths from dated localities and, probably, the maximum total number of population were established for the range of 38.2-8.6 cal ky BP (Denekamp interstadial = Bryansk interstadial). In Western and Central Europe, the increase of population was observed during Huneborg stadial (40.8-38.2 cal ky BP). In eastern Siberia, the maximum population growth occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum (28.6-22.5 cal ky BP), and in Western Siberia - during Deglaciation (22.5-14.7 cal ky BP). The population dynamics at the periphery of the range (Islands of Japan, British Isles, Northern Europe, Southern Siberia and Northern China, and, but to lesser extent, South-Eastern Europe) differs from the dynamics of its main part. The southernmost parts of the range - Southern Siberia and southeastern Europe experienced similar changes. Population dynamics in the Iberian Peninsula was much alike the changes in Western and Central Europe. We suggested that some peripheral populations could periodically be isolated from the populations of the main part of the range. Direct calibrated radiocarbon dates fixed upper boundary of extinction of this species in different parts of range within time interval from 21 (the Iberian Peninsula) to 4 (northeastern Siberia) thousands years BP. The hypotheses about the causes of the dynamics of the area and population of the mammoth in Eurasia, including those related to the extinction of certain genetic lines of a mammoth in the Late Pleistocene, are being discussed.

45,"European Frit Fly in North America | The investigations recorded in this paper were carried out in 1914-1916. A history of the early records of the frit fly is given. Linnaeus described the insect in 1758 as Musca frit [Oscinella frit]; Fabricius included it in the genus Oscinis. Since that date frit flies have been recorded as various species of Oscinis in North America, but the author's studies of these forms have led him to the conclusion that O. pusilla, Meig., O. nitidissima, Meig., O. carbonaria, Lw., O. variabilis. Lw O. nigra, Tucker, and O. soror, Macq., are all synonyms of Oscinella (Oscinis) frit, the multiplicity of names having arisen from the variability and wide distribution of the species. | ['aldrich'] | ",['aldrich'],0
46,"Evidence of Ice Age humans in eastern Beringia suggests early migration to North America | Our understanding of the timing and pathway of human arrival to the Americas remains an important and polarizing topic of debate in archaeology and anthropology. Traditional consensus, supported by archaeological and paleoenvironmental data, favors a ‚Äòswift peopling‚Äô of the Americas from Asia via the Bering Land Bridge during the last Glacial termination. More recent genetic data and archaeological finds have challenged this view, proposing the ‚ÄòBeringian standstill hypothesis‚Äô (BSH), wherein a population of proto-Americans migrated from Asia during, or even prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and lived in Beringia for thousands of years before their eventual spread across the American continents. Using a sediment archive from Lake E5 (68.641667¬∞ N, 149.457706¬∞ W), located on Alaska's North Slope, we present new data supporting the BSH and shedding new light on the environmental impact of these early American populations. Fecal biomarkers support human presence in the environs of the lake, and our data demonstrate elevated biomass burning in this region during the last Glacial. Elevated burning defies the expectation that natural fires would be less frequent in the Arctic during the last Glacial, thereby suggesting human ignition as the likely culprit. Our data shed new light on the pathway and timing of human migration to the Americas and demonstrate the possibility of the sustainable coexistence of humans and the Ice Age megafauna in Beringia prior to their extinction. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd | ['daniel', 'dee', 'huang', 'longo', 'russell', 'vachula'] | ","['daniel', 'dee', 'huang', 'longo', 'russell', 'vachula']",4

50,"Exploring the phylogeography and population dynamics of the giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) using Late Quaternary mitogenomes | Late Quaternary climatic fluctuations in the Northern Hemisphere had drastic effects on large mammal species, leading to the extinction of a substantial number of them. The giant deer (Megaloceros giganteus) was one of the species that became extinct in the Holocene, around 7660 calendar years before present. In the Late Pleistocene, the species ranged from western Europe to central Asia. However, during the Holocene, its range contracted to eastern Europe and western Siberia, where the last populations of the species occurred. Here, we generated 35 Late Pleistocene and Holocene giant deer mitogenomes to explore the genetics of the demise of this iconic species. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the mitogenomes suggested five main clades for the species: three pre-Last Glacial Maximum clades that did not appear in the post-Last Glacial Maximum genetic pool, and two clades that showed continuity into the Holocene. Our study also identified a decrease in genetic diversity starting in Marine Isotope Stage 3 and accelerating during the Last Glacial Maximum. This reduction in genetic diversity during the Last Glacial Maximum, coupled with a major contraction of fossil occurrences, suggests that climate was a major driver in the dynamics of the giant deer. | ['barnes', 'brace', 'bradley', 'campos', 'daly', 'hansen', 'lister', 'mattiangeli', 'rey', 'iglesia', 'teasdale'] | ","['barnes', 'brace', 'bradley', 'campos', 'daly', 'hansen', 'lister', 'mattiangeli', 'rey', 'iglesia', 'teasdale']",0

52,"Field Research on the Bolshoy Lyakhovskiy Island (Eastern Russian Arctic Region) | The study how the modern human formed at the Eurasian oecumene is always actual for Stone Age History. As a part of this problem the investigation of Late Pleistocene - Early Holocene epoch at the transitional territories such as Western Beringia is the priority direction in modern Paleolithic science. This region was being studied intensively during the last century, but the found stratified sites of this geological boundary are mainly located in inland of the North Eastern Asia. Until quite recently, the islands were poorly explored in this region. Zhokhovo site on the homonymous island and Chertov Ovrag on the Wrangel Island were the single evidences that ancient human inhabited the islands of Russian Arctic Region. Until recently, Lyakhovskiy Islands explored with natural-science methods only. The new occurrences Zimovie-1 and -2 were found out in the Zimovie river basin on the Southern coast of Bolshoy Lyakhovskiy Island. It can be the evidence of Late Pleistocene human colonization in this territory. Collected faunal remains are common with Late Neo-Pleistocene of North Eastern Asia. The target Late Neo-Pleistocene Paleolithic objects are relevant to primal settlement of the paleopopulations. Their investigations will contribute to solution of the problem when modern human appeared and how he developed.

53,"First pre-modern record of the gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) in north-east Greenland | Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) is the largest falcon in the world. It inhabits a wide range of climate zones in the Northern Hemisphere, from boreal forests in the south of its range to the arid polar deserts of the High Arctic. In Greenland, because of the harsh, remote environments in which gyrfalcons live, research related to the contemporary and pre-modern periods has been limited to the north-west, central west and central east coasts, with no specific investigations being conducted for the north-east. Here, we report the first pre-modern record of a gyrfalcon in north-east Greenland, located at 80.4 degrees N in Kronprins Christian Land. Skin tissue from a decaying gyrfalcon's body was radiocarbon dated to 769-944 CE ( common era) using a terrestrial-only calibration curve, and 1182-1456 CE using a marine-only calibration curve. Since the gyrfalcon has a mixed terrestrial/marine diet, the actual age can be said to belong between these two groups. This limited data, therefore places the presence of the gyrfalcon in north-east Greenland during a period of prolonged elevated temperatures and climate stress associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Whether the gyrfalcon was part of a larger population or a straggler, and whether the species survived the whole of the Medieval Climate Anomaly in north-east Greenland, is unknown. | ['edward', 'gilg', 'gotfredsen', 'gregersen', 'hajdas', 'moseley', 'rosvold', 'spoetl'] | ","['edward', 'gilg', 'gotfredsen', 'gregersen', 'hajdas', 'moseley', 'rosvold', 'spoetl']",0

57,"The flickering genes of the last mammoths | Woolly mammoths, Mammuthus primigenius, are arguably the most iconic of the extinct Pleistocene megafauna, and an abundance of large permafrost-embedded bone and ivory material (Fig. 1) means they were also among the first to yield credible DNA sequences (Hagelberg 1994; Hoss 1994). Despite mammoth remains being numerous throughout northern Eurasia and North America, both the earliest and most recent fossils are found in northeast Siberia, with the last known population being confined to Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean from around 10,000 years ago until their extinction around 4,000 years ago. The extent to which these Holocene mammoths were descended from the Pleistocene populations of Wrangel Island and the demographic nature of their terminal decline have, until now, remained something of a mystery. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Nystrom (2012) report the first use of autosomal variation to track the decline of the last mammoths and, in doing so, take a significant step towards resolving these questions. The authors genotyped four microsatellite loci in 59 Pleistocene and Holocene mammoths from Wrangel Island and Chukotka in mainland northeastern Siberia and showed that while the Pleistocene-to-Holocene transition is associated with a significant reduction in genetic diversity, subsequent levels of variation remain constant until extinction. Such a pattern is somewhat surprising as it indicates that while the last mammoths were confined to only a few Arctic islands, their final extinction on Wrangel Island was not a gradual process resulting from loss of genetic diversity/inbreeding. Instead, it seems they maintained a viable effective population size of around 500 until near their presumably rapid extinction. While the ultimate agent of mammoth extinction remains unknown, the work of Nystrom (2012). suggests that we should be looking for something sudden, like a rapid change in climate/ecology or perhaps the arrival of humans. 1 Sergey Vartanyan during field collection, holding a woolly mammoth tusk found along a river embankment in northeast Siberia (photographer: Diana Solovyeva). | ['thomas'] | ",['thomas'],4

59,"A study on Holocene foraminifera from the Aral Sea and West Siberian lakes and its implication for migration pathways | Late Holocene cored sediments from the Aral Sea were examined in respect of foraminiferal diversity and the tests of 4 species of foraminifera were differentiated. The species are listed and documented by SEM photographs. All of the identified species from the Aral Sea belong to the Ponto-Caspian faunal complex. Another Ponto-Caspian foraminiferal species is found in the mid-Holocene sediments of Kushmurun Lake located in the Turgai Valley in the southern part of the West Siberian Lowland. During the Holocene neither the water level of the Caspian Sea nor that of the Aral Sea was high enough to create a northern connection with West Siberia via the Turgai Valley. During the late glacial such a waterway may have existed due to overflowing of huge proglacial lakes in northern West Siberia. The water flow, however, would have been directed to the south preventing foraminiferal migration to the north. Moreover, the freshwater conditions would not have allowed foraminifers to survive. Thus, foraminifera were transported to the West Siberian lakes from the Caspian Sea or from the Aral Sea by water birds. Avian-mediated colonization of lacustrine ecosystems by foraminifera is not an exception, but a regular process. The Aral Sea was re-colonized during the Holocene several times with the aid of water birds from the Caspian Sea. | ['kossler', 'riedel', 'tarasov', 'wuennemann'] | ","['kossler', 'riedel', 'tarasov', 'wuennemann']",4

65,"Glacial refugia and post-glacial colonization patterns in European bryophytes | Most species are assumed to have survived south or east of the ice sheet covering northern Europe during the last glacial maximum. Molecular and macrofossil evidence suggests, however, that some species may have survived in ice-free areas in Scandinavia. In plants, inbreeding and vegetative growth are associated with low genetic load and enhanced survival in small, isolated populations. These characteristics are often found in bryophytes, possibly allowing them to survive extreme conditions in isolated refugia and also within ice sheets. Here, we review the Holocene bryophyte history in Europe highlighting main glacial refugia and post-glacial colonization routes. Also, meta-analyses are performed to investigate if distribution ranges and genetic structure are associated with life-history traits. Bryophytes survived the last glaciation in several refugia, but there is no unequivocal evidence of survival within the Scandinavian ice sheet.

66,"Holocene glaciation of Alaska (and Adjoining YUKON Territory, Canada) | Holocene glacial fluctuations between Arctic, central interior, and southern maritime Alaska are broadly synchronous. This synchrony is evident from a review of work in 11 study areas with varying numbers of glaciers (3-100), glacier types (subpolar cirque, temperate valley, tidewater, surging), and dating methodologies. The pattern is temporally and spatially consistent with vegetation data, and generally with climatic deteriorations culminating in the Little Ice Age. Early Holocene glacial advances are confirmed for 7.6-5.8 lichen ka BP at 4 of 97 glaciers in the Brooks Range; advances also occurred by 5.85 and 5.7 ka BP at separate glacier tongues in the northern Alaska Range, at least by 6-5 ka BP in Lituya Bay, and possibly also in the Malaspina and Aleutian Islands areas. A sharp increase in glacier activity began by 4.4 ka BP in the Arctic and Glacier Bay areas, and by about 3 ka BP major glacier advances probably were initiated or well underway throughout Alaska. During Holocene glacial maxima, ice filled Glacier and Lituya Bays as well as fjords of Prince William Sound, and massive moraines buried forests in the northeastern St. Elias Mountains area. Minor recession is recorded directly or implied in most of Alaska about 2 ka BP or locally through the following millennium. Subsequently, distinct but locally weak advances occurred by about 1.2 ka BP in most areas, again followed by intervals of glacier recession. Most pervasive and ubiquitous were the Little Ice Age advances initiated about 700 BP. These generally culminated in two major advances between about 400 and 50 BP. In the Arctic, those of A.D. 1600 dominated those of the late 1800s; in the Gulf of Alaska, those of the middle 1700s or late 1800s dominated. Large scale, asynchronous advances and retreats of calving tidewater glaciers have been recorded during the twentieth century but most such movements are only indirectly related to climate. ¬© 1988. | ['calkin'] | ",['calkin'],1

68,"Of glaciers and refugia: a decade of study sheds new light on the phylogeography of northwestern North America | Glacial cycles have played a dominant role in shaping the genetic structure and distribution of biota in northwestern North America. The two major ice age refugia of Beringia and the Pacific Northwest were connected by major mountain chains and bordered by the Pacific Ocean. As a result, numerous refugial options were available for the regions taxa during glacial advances. We reviewed the importance of glaciations and refugia in shaping northwestern North America's phylogeographic history. We also tested whether ecological variables were associated with refugial history. The recurrent phylogeographic patterns that emerged were the following: (i) additional complexity, i.e. refugia within refugia, in both Beringia and the Pacific Northwest; and (ii) strong evidence for cryptic refugia in the Alexander Archipelago and Haida Gwaii, the Canadian Arctic and within the ice-sheets. Species with contemporary ranges that covered multiple refugia, or those with high dispersal ability, were significantly more likely to have resided in multiple refugia. Most of the shared phylogeographic patterns can be attributed to multiple refugial locales during the last glacial maximum or major physiographic barriers like rivers and glaciers. However, some of the observed patterns are much older and appear connected to the orogeny of the Cascade-Sierra chain or allopatric differentiation during historic glacial advances. The emergent patterns from this review suggest we should refine the classic Beringian-southern refugial paradigm for northwestern North American biota and highlight the ecological and evolutionary consequences of colonization from multiple refugia. | ['coltman', 'cote', 'cullingham', 'shafer'] | ","['coltman', 'cote', 'cullingham', 'shafer']",0

74,"A history of ground-beetle faunas of West Siberia and the Urals during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene | Changes in ground-beetle faunas of the Urals and West Siberia during the past 130,000 years were elucidated based on fossil material obtained from more than 100 sites scattered over this region. During the warm phase of the Eremian Interglacial, the areas lying between 61 and 62 degrees N latitude supported boreal insect faunas. Insect faunas from deposits dated to the Early Weichselian interval (100,000-55,000 yr BP), in the central part of the study region were different from present-day communities, being defined as ""mixed"", or tundra-steppe. A similar situation is described for the end of the Mid-Weichselian interstadial interval (from >33,000 to 23,000 yr BP). In the faunas dated from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Sartan Glaciation), only arctic and subarctic species were found. Sub-boreal and boreal species were missing from these faunas. The end of the LGM was characterised by climatic instability, causing discrepancies between palaeoentomological and palacobotanical evidence. The subsequent processes of afforestation and water-logging which occurred after 8,000 yr BP in West Siberia and adjacent lands caused reductions in the ranges of arctic and arcto-boreal beetle species and the regional disappearance of some sub-boreal forms (Poecilus ravus, Cymindis mannerbeimi) which have since shifted their distributions eastwards to the East Siberian steppes or the subalpine belt of the Pamirs and western Altai Mountains. | ['zinovyev'] | ",['zinovyev'],4

77,"Ice Age Plant Refugia in East Greenland | From the distribution of plants it has been inferred by some botanists that ice-free areas existed in East Greenland accommodating a flora which survived one or several ice ages in the area. Comparing this evidence with recent information on the chronology of glaciations and post-glacial vegetation development, there is both significant agreement and disagreement. The early hypothesis of survival of organisms since Tertiary times is refuted by the ubiquitous occurrence of glacigene deposits. However, some of the areas pointed out as sites for survival have remained ice-free longer than adjacent parts of Greenland. 14C dating and amino acid age estimates of marine sediments show that lowland areas near the outer coast have been ice-free for at least 40,000 yr. The vegetation history, as reflected in pollen diagrams extending back to about 10,000 yr B.P., has shown that many of the extant species immigrated from northern Europe and North America in post-glacial times. This contingency includes both some thermophilous species that were suggested as survivors by one group of botanists, and some extremely hardy species that were thought to have survived by another group. From the palynological evidence it is inferred that the flora in the refugia comprised mainly species which today occur over a wide geographical and ecological range. The odd occurrences that initiated the discussion may represent random seed dispersal accumulated in the ice-free areas through long periods of time. | ['funder'] | ",['funder'],0

81,"Introduction to the Nature and Geology of Iceland | Iceland is an island in the northern North Atlantic halfway between Europe and Greenland/North America and some of its northern parts touch the Arctic Circle. Its position at the conjunction of warm southerly and cold northerly waters and air masses contribute to a particular climate that is unusually mild considering the high latitude of the island. From a biogeographical point of view, Iceland is an important place for both palaeontologists and recent botanists and zoologists. Geologically, Iceland is unique as it is situated at the boundary of the North American and Eurasian plates and is one of the few places on the Earth where sea-floor spreading can be witnessed on land. In this northern part of the Atlantic, the North American continent began to move away from the Eurasian continent by rifting and sea-floor spreading in the early Palaeogene, ca 55 Ma. When sea-floor spreading initiated in this area, a rich flow of magma generated by a mantle plume caused thermal doming of the crust and formed a connection or 'land bridge' between the continents known as the Greenland-Scotland Transverse Ridge. Subsequently, the eastern and western limits of this bridge sank as a consequence of continuous rifting and crustal cooling. Today, Iceland is still subaerial because of its position over this very same mantle plume. In the late Cainozoic, rift relocation had an important effect on the geology of Iceland and caused massive erosion and deposition of sediments, some of which contain the plant fossils described in this book. This chapter provides an introduction to the recent climate, weather systems and ocean currents affecting Iceland, and presents the most important details of the island's living fauna and flora. We also outline the geological background necessary to place the fossiliferous formations in a context. | ['denk', 'grimsson', 'simonarson', 'zetter'] | ","['denk', 'grimsson', 'simonarson', 'zetter']",0

The closest analogue of the Early Pleistocene faunal complex Muhkai 2 is a community of animals from the dry African savannah. Data to distinguish between the early and late (1.1 Mya) stages of the Taman fauna are presented. It was confirmed that in the Late Pleistocene, the climate was responsible for changes in the number of large mammals and their habitats. It was shown that the domestication of the dog occurred in the early Upper Paleolithic, and in the Holocene, the indigenous European population of Canis familiaris was largely replaced by migrants from the east. Data are given that support that throughout the Quaternary at archaeological sites and settlements in the European part of Russia, there was a practice of complete utilization of hunted or raised animals. | ['sablin'] | ",['sablin'],0
86,"Last glacial ecology and geoarchaeology of the Central Trans-Ural area: the Sosva River Upper Palaeolithic Complex, western Siberia | Quaternary and geoarchaeology studies from the eastern limits of the Ural Mountains provide multiple lines of evidence of the Palaeolithic peopling of this geographically marginal and still poorly explored territory of western Siberia following the mid-last glacial (MIS 3) warming. A complex of investigated open-air localities in the Sosva River basin (the north-central Trans-Ural area) at the periphery of the western Siberian Plain, distinguished by very high concentrations of Pleistocene megafaunal remains previously regarded as 'mammoth cemeteries', indicate, in conjunction with the associated diagnostic ivory/bone and stone industry, open occupation sites during the Last Glacial (MIS 2). Fossil faunal remains, dominated by mammoth (98%) together with bird and fish species, indicate various methods of exploitation of the Late Pleistocene natural resources and successful behavioural adaptation to the last glacial sub-polar tundra-steppe environment. The taphonomy and composition of the well-preserved skeletal remains from the main occupation sites suggest both active hunting and anthropogenic 'scavenging' practices. The contextual geology and the cultural and biotic multi-proxy records from the Trans-Ural Upper Palaeolithic Complex provide new insights into the timing and palaeoecological conditions of the Pleistocene human occupation of north-central Asia. | ['chlachula', 'serikov'] | ","['chlachula', 'serikov']",4

88,"Late-glacial vegetational, tephra, and climatic history of southwestern Kodiak Island, Alaska | Late-glacial vegetational, tephra, and climatic history of western Kodiak Island is developed based upon detailed palynological, macrofossil, and AMS 14C stratigraphy. A series of distinctive Purple, White, and Grey tephras allows correlation amongst several sections along the southwestern Kodiak coastline. Changes in loss-on-ignition within these sections support our interpretation of climatic change since deglaciation. The macrofossil component of the sedimentary record provides insight for late-glacial plant diversity. Earliest vegetation after glacial recession 14000 years BP is composed of a diverse array of moist herbaceous species, along with a dominance of Empetrum nigrum (heath). As climate became warmer and moister after 13000 BP, Polypodiaceae (ferns) spread over the landscape. A dramatic reversal in vegetation and climate to colder, drier conditions is indicated from 10800 to 10000 years BP, which we term the ""Fern Gap"". We interpret this oscillation as a high-latitude Pacific expression of the Younger Dryas event, well-known from Greenland and continental regions surrounding the North Atlantic. The subsequent Holocene warming at 10000 years BP is quite abrupt, as shown by the section lithostratigraphy, palynological and macrofossil records, and percent loss on ignition. This late-glacial series of events indicates a high correlation between paleoclimate on Kodiak Island and the North Atlantic region, suggesting comparable climatic forcing in both regions. | ['mann', 'peteet'] | ","['mann', 'peteet']",4

90,"Late-Pleistocene and early Holocene history of the canid fauna of Europe (Canidae) | In the sub-fossil assemblages of Europe the red fox is clearly the most frequent carnivorous mammalian species with a total of 1553 records. In depositions from the Weichselian Glacial the red fox Vulpes vulpes is, a typical representative of the Holocene fauna, already recorded in 100 assemblages. The Iberian peninsula, Italian peninsula and Balkans were theorised as glacial refugia. Well-founded facts give reason to believe that V vulpes was also distributed in the Carpathian refuge. Later on, the Crimean peninsula would also appear to be a possible glacial refuge of the red fox. In the last warmer complex of interstadials during the Pleni-Glacial (Hengelo-Denekamp, 38,000-25,000 BC) the red fox was distributed in central Europe. Its distribution during this epoch extended at least in part to southern England. The earliest well-dated records of V vulpes in central Europe after the Maximum Glaciation lie between 14,000 and 13,500 BC. Already during the early Late-Glacial (13,500 BC) the red fox appeared in typical glacial faunal communities. A separation to glacial refugia was only possible for 10,000 years.During the last warmer Pleni-Glacial complex of interstadials (38,000-25,000 BC) in central Europe a sympatric distribution of the arctic fox (Alopex tagopus) and the red fox probably existed. During the Last Glacial Maximum (22,000-18,000 BC) the arctic fox was exclusively distributed in central Europe, outside of the refuges. The combined distribution of A. lagopus and V vulpes during the Late-Glacial (15,000-9500 BC) in central Europe, with the probable exception of the Allerod, is precisely documented by sub-fossil assemblages.In the Pleni-Glacial the wolf Canis lupus was distributed in geographic regions that served as glacial refugia of more warm-climate adapted species. Concerning the wolf no drastic decrease of the distribution is assumed. The Holocene presence of C. lupus is probably not caused by recolonisation. (C) 2005 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

Following a eustatic low in sea level of ca. -120 m at 19,000 BP, a marine transgression had flooded the Bering and Chukchi shelves by 10,000 BP. Post-glacial sea-level history varied widely in other parts of the North Pacific coastline according to the magnitude and timing of local tectonism and glacio-isostatic rebound. Glaciers covered much of the continental shelf between the Alaska Peninsula and British Columbia during the LGM. Maximum glacier extent during the LGM was out of phase between southern Alaska and southern British Columbia with northern glaciers reaching their outer Limits earlier, between 23,000 and 16,000 BP, compared to 15,000-14,000 BP in the south. Glacier retreat was also time-transgressive, with glaciers retreating from the continental shelf of southern Alaska before 16,000 BP but not until 14,000-13,000 BP in southwestern British Columbia. Major climatic transitions occurred in the North Pacific at 24,000-22,000, 15,000-13,000 and 11,000-9000 BP. Rapid climate changes occurred within these intervals, including a possible Younger Dryas episode. An interval of climate warmer and drier than today occurred in the early Holocene.

Vertebrate remains from Epiguruk include mammoth, bison, caribou, an equid, a canid, arctic ground squirrel, lemmings, and voles. Radiocarbon ages of bone validated by concordant ages of peat and wood span the interval between about 37,000 and 14,000 yr B.P. The late Pleistocene pollen record is dominated by Cyperaceae, with Artemisia, Salix, Betula, and Gramineae also generally abundant. The fossil record from Epiguruk indicates that the Kobuk River valley supported tundra vegetation with abundant riparian willows during middle and late Wisconsin time. Large herbivores were present during the height of late Wisconsin glaciation as well as during its waning stage and the preceding interstadial interval.

Well-developed raised beaches rise to the Late Weichselian marine limit at 36 m a.s.l. Discontinuous pre-Late Weichselian beach deposits rise from the Late Weichselian marine limit to approximately 65 m a.s.l. Expansion of local glaciers in the area during the Late Weichselian is indicated by a till that locally overlies pre-Late Weichselian raised beach deposits. Stratigraphic data from coastal sections reveal two shallow marine units deposited during part of oxygen isotope stage 5. The two shallow marine units are separated by a subglacially deposited till that indicates an ice advance from Prins Karls Forland into the Forlandsundet basin some time during the latter part of stage 5. Discontinuous glaciofluvial deposits and a cobble-boulder lag could relate to a Late Weichselian local glacial advance across the coastal site. Late Weichselian/early Holocene beach deposits cap the sedimentary succession.

98,"Late Quaternary history of the northern beetle fauna of North America: a synthesis of forest and distribution evidence | An open-ground beetle fauna of arctic-subarctic affinities had become established along the southern margin of the Laurentide ice sheet in the midcontinent by 20 500 yr BP. Climatic warming decimated this fauna throughout lowland areas at some time between 16 700-15 300 yr BP; small populations of some arctic-subarctic species, however, survived within either alpine habitats of the Cordillera and Appalachians or specialized environments associated with stagnant ice. Populations of the same arctic-subarctic beetle species existed within the ice-free Alaska-Yukon refugium throughout the Late Wisconsinan. During the Holocene, this region served as the principal centre-of-origin for the dispersal of the arctic-subarctic beetle fauna. The beetle fauna of the boreal forest was also displaced southward by Late Wisconsinan glaciation.

The oldest shell dates from raised marine deposits that provide minimum ages for the last deglaciation are 9300 cal. yr BP (northern Washington Land) and 7600 cal. yr BP (SW Washington Land). These dates indicate that Washington Land, which borders the central part of Nares Strait separating Greenland from Ellesmere Island in Canada, did not become free of glacier ice until well into the Holocene. The elevation of the marine limit falls from 110 m a.s.l. in the north to 60 m a.s.l. in the southwest. The recession was followed by readvance of glaciers in the late Holocene, and the youngest shell date from Neoglacial lateral moraines north of Humboldt Gletscher is 600 cal. yr BP. Since the Neoglacial maximum, probably around 100 years ago, glaciers have receded.

101,"Late Quaternary paleoenvironments and modern pollen data from Wrangel Island (Northern Chukotka) | New lacustrine records from central and southern Wrangel Island are analyzed for their pollen content in an attempt to clarify possible linkages between paleoenvironmental shifts and the dwarfing and/or extinction of the island's mammoth population. A Younger Dryas-aged peat is also examined to provide better understanding of the regional climatic history. Samples of surficial lake sediments from Wrangel Island and Chukotka aid in interpreting the lacustrine records. The modern spectra differentiate the herb-dominated tundra of Wrangel Island from the shrub tundras of the mainland and are unique when compared to other arctic assemblages. Analysis of the fossil data indicates that a herb-dominated tundra has been present on southern and central Wrangel Island since at least 11 ka BP. Comparison to modern palynological data implies little change in vegetation during the Holocene. The lacustrine interpretations contrast to those based on paleobotanical study of peats and alluvium, which suggest modern vegetation was not present until ca 4-3 ka BP. Pre-Holocene assemblages have high percentages of Cyperaceae pollen, perhaps indicating more moderate conditions. Summer climate is inferred to be warmer and moister than present during the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene. The pattern of postglacial warming on Wrangel Island is more like that from eastern Beringia than from other areas of western Beringia. Modern synoptic anomaly maps indicate that such a climatic pattern is reasonable and related to the presence of negative anomalies over western Beringia and a region of weaker positive 500 mb pressure centered over the Beaufort Sea.

104,"Mammal fauna during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in the far northeast of Europe | The paper summarises materials on the mammal remains in northeastern Europe, dated by radiocarbon. Altogether, 23 local faunas of small mammals and 47 local faunas of large mammals were analysed. Multidimensional statistical analysis shows a strong correlation between changes in small mammal fauna composition and climate changes throughout time. The correlations with the spatial gradients, however, are less pronounced. The faunas are classified into three groups: (1) faunas of Holocene age; (2) Late Pleistocene stadial' assemblages; and (3) Late Pleistocene interstadial' assemblages. In some cases, changes in species abundance are better understood in terms of biotic interrelations rather than of climatic effects. The most pronounced change in small mammal fauna composition and structure occurred at the Preboreal/Boreal boundary, and a less conspicuous alteration took place at the LGM/Lateglacial transition. The most noticeable transformation in the large mammal fauna composition is dated to the early Holocene. Less significant changes are observed at the Middle Weichselian/LGM transition and at the LGM/Lateglacial transition. It is safely concluded that variations in the faunas of small and large mammals recorded in NE Europe during the last 35000 years occurred synchronously and unidirectionally. | ['bachura', 'kosintsev', 'ponomarev', 'puzachenko', 'van', 'der', 'plicht'] | ","['bachura', 'kosintsev', 'ponomarev', 'puzachenko', 'van', 'der', 'plicht']",0

107,"Mammoth Trapping in the Yukon: A review of Northern Tutchone oral history evidence supporting the survival of Woolly Mammoths in the Yukon Territory within the past 1,000 years | This paper is a multi-disciplinary review of the Northern Tutchone oral history concerning encounters with Woolly Mammoths in their traditions. A comparison is made with similar traditions of other North American indigenous people, and this is reviewed against evidence for the existence and hunting of woolly mammoth in North America. The Ice Age geology and archaeology of the Yukon Territory is considered, coupled with wider oral histories of the other indigenous peoples who use Athapascan languages. This locates the Northern Tutchone in Yukon Territory only within the past 1,000 years. The Northern Tutchone legends are shown to contain credible descriptions of encounters with woolly mammoth, which implies the relatively recent survival of these animals in the Yukon. A discussion of the history of woolly mammoth and other Ice Age fauna in the Yukon concludes with an examination of some major finds of animal remains, and the problems of radiocarbon dating in this context. It is argued that the wide disparity between radiocarbon dating of Ice Age fauna and flora found in the Yukon and the multi-disciplinary evidence supporting the oral history of the Northern Tutchone casts doubt on the reliability of radiocarbon dating in this context. Dates between 600 and 1,000 years ago are proposed for the events behind the Northern Tutchone mammoth legends. | ['johnson'] | ",['johnson'],4
108,"Maritime adaptation on the northern Alaska Peninsula | Two geographic regions form the northern Peninsula, separated by mountains and a major ecological boundary. After 6000 radiocarbon years ago, a subsistence distinction becomes evident with people of the Bering Sea plain maintaining interest in land mammals, and those of the steep Pacific coast beginning sea mammal and fishery exploitation. After 4000 BP, habitation structures are found on the Pacific coast in sites with faunal remains indicating some mastery in harvesting offshore marine resources. Meanwhile, on the Bering Sea plain northern-affiliated peoples of the Arctic Small Tool tradition appear, construct semisubterranean houses, and focus their subsistence on migrating salmon as well as on the Peninsula caribou herd. After 2300 years ago, multihouse settlements occur on both sides of the Peninsula, and traits of the Bering Sea slope begin to appear on the Pacific. These increase through time, evidently as Bering Sea people infiltrate the open Pacific coast, presumably attracted by marine resources. After 1000 BP, the peoples of the two sides of the Peninsula occupy substantial settlements, are culturally conjoined, and manifest the subsistence interest of known historic Eskimo-speakers, balanced between products of the coast, interior caribou herds, and salmon of the streams. | ['dumond'] | ",['dumond'],0
109,"Mass accumulations of mammoth (mammoth 'graveyards') with indications of past human activity in the northern Yana-Indighirka lowland, Arctic Siberia | In recent years, new accumulations of mammoth faunal remains have been discovered in the northern part of the Yana-Indighirka lowland. Such areas are referred to as ""mammoth graveyards"" since the discovery of the Berelekh complex of geoarchaeological locales. It's been determined that all of these locales contain various amounts of evidence of past human activity associated with the use of bone accumulations as a valuable raw material source (mammoth ivory). These locales indicate that humans were widely spread in Arctic Siberia during the Late Pleistocene (MIS 3 and 2). At least some of these sites could have formed as a result of ancient people hunting mammoths. In this article we discuss two newly discovered sites, which currently represent the northernmost evidence of human presence in the Arctic at the end of the Pleistocene. They were found in the Maksunuokha River valley, to the south of the Shirokostan Peninsula. The Urez-22 site (MKR/U22) is located at 71 degrees 42' N and is currently the northernmost Paleolithic site in the world. The Lake Nikita site (NKL) is situated 40 km away from Urez-22, and both sites contain numerous remains of mammoth. The NKL site material represents the earlier of the two ancient human habitation episodes. This site's age is estimated at similar to 13,800 to 13,600 years ago. The NKL site is a complete chronological and cultural ""duplicate"" of the Berelekh site, which points to a relatively wide spread of this culture in Northeast Asia. NewWorld implements, similar to those found at the Berelekh site and NKL, are known as the Chindadn points. At this point, they represent the only tangible evidence of the cultural connection between the materials from Northeast Asia and Northwest North America. The age of Urez-22 can be estimated at the time slice of similar to 14,900 to 13,900 years ago. Archaeological material was encountered in redeposited concentrations, created by a low-energy stream. Artifacts from Urez-22 demonstrate the spread of microblade industry, older than the early Holocene, for the first time in the Siberian Arctic. This new material indicates noticeable cultural originality of the region during the Late Paleolithic and promises success in the future search for Paleolithic sites in the Yana-Indighirka lowland.

110,"Megafaunal extinctions and the disappearance of a specialized wolf ecomorph | The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is one of the few large predators to survive the Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions [1]. Nevertheless, wolves disappeared from northern North America in the Late Pleistocene, suggesting they were affected by factors that eliminated other species. Using skeletal material collected from Pleistocene permafrost deposits of eastern Beringia, we present a comprehensive analysis of an extinct vertebrate by exploring genetic (mtDNA), morphologic, and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) data to reveal the evolutionary relationships, as well as diet and feeding behavior, of ancient wolves. Remarkably, the Late Pleistocene wolves are genetically unique and morphologically distinct. None of the 16 mtDNA haplotypes recovered from a sample of 20 Pleistocene eastern-Beringian wolves was shared with any modern wolf, and instead they appear most closely related to Late Pleistocene wolves of Eurasia. Moreover, skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic data suggest that eastern-Beringian wolves were specialized hunters and scavengers of extinct megafauna. Thus, a previously unrecognized, uniquely adapted, and genetically distinct wolf ecomorph suffered extinction in the Late Pleistocene, along with other megafauna. Consequently, the survival of the species in North America depended on the presence of more generalized forms elsewhere. | ['fox', 'dobbs', 'koch', 'leonard', 'van', 'valkenburgh', 'vila', 'wayne'] | ","['fox', 'dobbs', 'koch', 'leonard', 'van', 'valkenburgh', 'vila', 'wayne']",4
111,"The MIS 3-2 environments of the middle Kolyma Basin: implications for the Ice Age peopling of northeast Arctic Siberia | The Kolyma region is historically famous for the unique finds of large Pleistocene fauna, yet, until very recently, absent of the time-corresponding occupation sites. Quaternary geology and palaeontology investigations (2013-2019) in the middle reaches of the Kolyma River (NE Yakutia) have delivered new evidence on the Last Glacial (MIS 4-2) to Early Holocene sub-arctic ecosystems and the past landscape dynamics retrieved from the fossiliferous bodies exposed from thawed grounds. The palaeoecology multi-proxies from the MIS 3 (55-24 ka) cryolithic formations document riparian, larch-dominated northern forests and open parklands with backwater channels, marshlands and lakes. The abundant skeletal remains of Pleistocene ungulates and carnivores, as well as relic flora point to long-term biomass-rich interstadial ecosystems and favourable Palaeolithic occupation habitats. Utilized animal bones, worked mammoth ivory and stone tools show the presence of pre-modern humans in the northeast Russian Arctic >45 000 years ago. Flaked mammoth tusks suggest persistence of settlement during the Last Glacial Maximum in xeric and extremely cold (sub)arctic tundra. The postglacial climate shifts triggered major environmental and hydrological transformations. The final Pleistocene/Early Holocene warming brought restructuring of the Last Ice Age landscape and vanishing of the periglacial tundra-steppe replaced by the present-day larch-dominated Siberian taiga. The mid-Last Glacial human ecology records from the geographical limits of northeast Siberia have fundamental relevance for the reconstructions of the time trajectories and the natural conditions of peopling of Beringia. | ['cheprasov', 'chlachula', 'little', 'novgorodov', 'obada'] | ","['cheprasov', 'chlachula', 'little', 'novgorodov', 'obada']",4
112,"The Middle Palaeolithic of the central Trans-Urals: Present evidence | The Urals and the adjacent regions, located at the easternmost limits of Europe and representing a geographic borderline with northern Asia/West Siberia, are of key relevance for comprehension of the culture-historical trajectories and environmental contexts of early peopling to this still marginally explored montage Russian territory. Complex Quaternary transformations of regional natural settings due to climate change controlled timing and dynamics of Palaeolithic occupation in the central mountain zone, foothills and adjoining Fore-Ural and Trans-Ural plains. Following the earliest and still sporadically mapped presence of the pre-Middle Pleistocene humans in the upper Kama Basin, the first marked geoarchaeology evidence is linked to the Middle Palaeolithic inhabitation of the Urals foothills and the mountain inner valleys. The Chusovaya River valley and its tributary valleys, transecting the Central Ural's mountain range NE-SW, were the principal corridor for the following Middle and Upper Palaeolithic migrations into the eastern (Trans-Ural) regions and West Siberia. Except for mountain karst formations, present Middle Palaeolithic habitat indices come from the eastern Ural foothills, the Leba, Neiva and Tara River basins, with occupation and workshop sites nearby natural exposures of rocky outcrops exploited as raw material deposits for lithic industry production. Diagnostic technological attributes of employed Levallois and bifacial stone flaking techniques with corresponding lithic artefact inventories provide some means for the general pre-Upper Palaeolithic age-assessment of the investigated sites. The limited number of the mapped Middle Palaeolithic loci does not allow evaluation of spatio-temporal settlement patterns. The present cultural evidence illustrates successful biological and behavioural adjustments to the Central Urals ecosystems in the framework of Middle/Late Pleistocene cultural development.

113,"Molecular Biogeography of the High Mountain Systems of Europe: An Overview | The biogeography of alpine and arctic-alpine species is complex, much more complex than thought until relatively recently. Alpine species survived glacial periods mostly within refugia in close proximity to the mountains where they are found today. One mountain range can be colonised from several glacial refugia, while one refugium can be the source of colonisation of more than one mountain range. The zonal distributions in the glacial cold steppes are only of importance for arctic-alpine species. Their arctic ranges normally derive from there, while the southern mountains were colonised from there or from near-mountain refugia as in the cases of the alpine species. | ['schmitt'] | ",['schmitt'],4
114,"Multiple glacial refugia in the North American Arctic: Inference from phylogeography of the collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) | Cryptic northern refugia beyond the ice limit of the Pleistocene glaciations may have had significant influence on the current pattern of biodiversity in Arctic regions. In order to evaluate whether northern glacial refugia existed in the Canadian Arctic, we examined mitochondrial DNA phylogeography in the northernmost species of rodents, the collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) sampled across its range of distribution in the North American Arctic and Greenland. The division of the collared lemming into the Canadian Arctic and eastern Beringia phylogroups does not support postglacial colonization of the North American Arctic from a single eastern Beringia refugium. Rather, the phylogeographical structure and sparse fossil records indicate that, during the last glaciation, some biologically significant refugia and important sources of postglacial colonization were located to the northwest of the main ice sheet in the Canadian Arctic. | ['fedorov', 'stenseth'] | ","['fedorov', 'stenseth']",0
115,"Nemoral species of Lepidoptera (Insecta) in Siberia: A novel view on their history and the timing of their range disjunctions | Distributions in Siberia of nemoral lepidopteran species, trophically or cenotically tied to broad-leaved (nemoral) forests or their phytocenotic derivates, display seven main types of range: Amphipalaearctic; Europe - West-Siberia - Far-East disjunctive; East-Europe - Altai - Far-East disjunctive; Altai - Far-East disjunctive; South-Siberia - Far-East; Transbaikalia - Far-East; Europe - Transuralia. An eastern origin can be traced for most of these species, with the exception of the last-mentioned type. According to palynological data, a continuous belt of broad-leaved forests was re-established during the Quaternary in North Eurasia at least twice: at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene and in the Middle Holocene. During the former the range of oak, as well as the fauna connected with it, was continuous through the Palaearctic. There is no reliable evidence for refuges of nemoral flora and fauna in Siberia during the last glaciation. We assume that the period since the Late Pleistocene (Kazantseva) Optimum (about 100,000-110,000 years) was sufficient for taxonomic divergence to species rank of western and eastern Palaearctic populations of Lepidoptera. During the Holocene climatic optimum the lepidopteran nemoral fauna could expand into a transpalaearctic distribution as a consequence of westward migration of eastern species due to an earlier optimum of broad-leaved forests in the eastern parts of Asia than in West Siberia and Eastern Europe. Disjunctive types of nemoral species range may have resulted from depletion of the forests with broad-leaved trees in Central Siberia during the Subboreal period of the Holocene. Thus, they should not be dated to the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene, as was done earlier. | ['dubatolov', 'kosterin'] | ","['dubatolov', 'kosterin']",4

118,"The Nunatac Theory Iii. Amphiatlants and Disjuncts | Amphiatlantic species are species occurring on both sides of the North Atlantic, but with large gaps in their distribution in Asia or in Western America. Figs. 1-3 show some distribution patterns. Some have a wide area in North America and Greenland, but are restricted to Fennoscandia in Europe; a list is given in tab. 1. These are generally calcicolous species of a continental distribution. Others are European species, but restricted to Greenland west of North Atlantic (tab. 2). These are generally species with an oceanic distribution pattern. Many of them are oligotrophic. There are close relations between the northern boreal and alpine floras of Fennoscandia, Scotland, Iceland and South Greenland, even on the level of subspecies or taxa of polymorphic groups of species, differing from corresponding taxa found in the Alps. This suggests a direct connection across the North Atlantic in relatively recent times. Paleogeographic reconstructions of the land west of Norway based on results from drillings in the North Sea depicts a land area in the Pliocene which subsided in late Pliocene to early Pleistocene times (fig. 6). This is corroborated by studies of marine molluscs in the polar basin and the North Atlantic suggesting a barrier to mollusc migration between the two basins which was broken about one million years ago (Strauch 1970, 1983). After the connection across the North Atlantic was broken, the amphiatlantic species must have survived somewhere along the coasts of the ocean. The amphiatlants are examples of disjunct distribution patterns. Areas with many disjunct species are also areas with high endemism. Hence the disjuncts are interpreted as relics, i.e. reflecting conditions no longer existing. Within Fennoscandia many interesting taxa are restricted to the two areas outlined in fig. 8. Such plants are said to have a centric distribution. Some are present in both areas, called bicentric taxa, others are only present in one area. Similar centric distribution patterns have also been described from Iceland and Greenland. The centric distribution patterns have been interpreted as reflecting the presence of refugia during the last glacial age. A closer examination of the habitat preferences of disjunct populations suggests a difference between them. This can be interpreted as a result of isolation during the glacial ages with loss of biotypes and hence of ability to migrate to new areas. The nunatac theory is based on an interpretation of the distribution of rare and disjunct species. However, the refugia were hardly botanic gardens with only rare plants. The bulk of the flora must have been species now common and widespread. It is difficult to conclude anything about their history from their distribution patterns. However, by gene analysis, new possibilities open up. This type of studies is just now in the beginning, but the results so far have been promising. The next and final contribution is concerned about the geological aspects of the problem. | ['dahl'] | ",['dahl'],0

This study examines the nature and timing of Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic culture change during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Cultural changes consist of four distinctive chronoclines in the archaeological record: (1) late Pleistocene big game animals disappeared from the archaeological record gradually from one species to the next, the largest first and the smallest last; (2) blade, core, and flake tools faded with the extirpation or extinction of large gregarious Pleistocene herbivores; (3) microblade technology appeared with the exploitation of a new suite of smaller, less gregarious game animals; and (4) the development of ground stone tools occurred after subsistence strategies shifted away from big game animals. The latter pattern was most likely associated with an increase in the procurement of plant food resources available in terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene forests. ¬© 1998 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

140,"Postglacial dispersal of freshwater fishes into Ontario | The present-day distributions of 117 native freshwater fishes in Ontario have been shaped by processes active following the Wisconsinan glacial period, 80000-10000 years before present. During this glacial period, these species survived in unglaciated refugia. To understand the processes that resulted in the recolonization of Ontario by fishes following the last glacial period, the refugial areas occupied by each species were determined using a refugial index, and glacial water bodies used as dispersal routes were identified. The refugial origins of the Ontario populations of 91 species were resolved. Seventy-two species resided in the Mississippian refugium, 13 species in the Atlantic Coastal refugium, 4 species in dual Atlantic Coastal-Mississippian refugia, 1 species in a Missourian refugium, and 1 species in Atlantic Coastal, Mississippian, and Missourian refugia. These conclusions differed significantly from those of other studies. Five general patterns were identified from the distributions of 104 species. In addition, there are 13 species that do not fit any of the general patterns. Most species with similar distributions in Ontario shared the same refugia and dispersal routes in eastern North America, therefore it is hypothesized that historical processes were important in shaping the present-day distributions of Ontario freshwater fishes. | ['crossman', 'mandrak'] | ","['crossman', 'mandrak']",0
141,"Postglacial dispersal of lower vertebrates in the Lake Agassiz region | The glacial Lake Agassiz basin provided dispersal routes by which most of the lower vertebrate fauna of central Canada, from the Mackenzie River to the Great Lakes, reinvaded the region following deglaciation. There are now a total of 106 fish, 19 amphibian, and 12 reptile species in the Lake Agassiz region. The most important source of this fauna was the upper Mississippi River basin, and the predominant direction of dispersal was from SE to NW. The Great Lakes, streams flowing southward into the upper Missouri River, and the Minnesota River spillway of Lake Agassiz were probably important early entry routes. Fish and amphibians also entered the region from the Yukon and Fraser River drainages, but these western forms mostly remained confined to the western portion of the region. Most of the reptiles probably entered the region from the Great Plains, and only 2 species of reptiles now occur north of the South Saskatchewan River drainage. During the last 18 yr, 2 fish species have appeared and subsequently have increased in abundance in the region, and 2 others have shown extensions of their distributions as a result of a man-made connection between drainage systems. -Authors | ['lindsey', 'stewart'] | ","['lindsey', 'stewart']",1

A total of four Roe deer bones are identified from three sites. This indicates that a Roe deer population was present in south-western Norway 6600-5300 BP and south-eastern Norway 7900-6700 BP. The lack of Roe deer bones in the other sites indicates that the species never had a wide distribution in the past. The present wide distribution of Roe deer in Norway is of recent date and probably caused by other factors than climate and vegetation alone. | ['hufthammer'] | ,['hufthammer'],0

Morphological structure of these bones indicates that they are bones of small adult animals (Mammuthus primigenius). Isotope investigation (813Ccarb, 5 13Ccoll, 815N) achieves: big (normal size) woolly mammoth lived at the north part of Yakutia during both worm and cold periods of the Late Pleistocene (from 50 kyr to 12 kyr BP). Small woolly mammoth probably lived during worm intervals of the Late Pleistocene only; most probably in warm periods mammoths had possibility to use more wide range of food or to use food inaccessible during cold time including one with greater proportion of proteins (shrub twigs?); small and ""normal"" woolly mammoths inhabited at different landscape (first lived at more moister places than second). Chemical composition (35 elements) of both small and ""normal"" mammoths' bones was determinated by the X-Ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF analysis). | ['alekseev', 'di', 'matteo', 'kuznetsova', 'lacumin', 'mashchenko', 'nikolaev', 'palombo'] | ","['alekseev', 'di', 'matteo', 'kuznetsova', 'lacumin', 'mashchenko', 'nikolaev', 'palombo']",1

Refugia are associated with 16 late Pleistocene localities of S. selaginoides, which in America are found in western Washington State and on the Queen Charlotte Islands of British Columbia and in Japan on the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido. Holocene data are derived from 10 mires selected from some 30 sites distributed across the North Pacific arc. Data based on first occurrences of the microspores in the dated deposits show that migration in the Eastern Pacific proceeded rapidly at first, the species reaching southeastern and south-central Alaska between 9000 and 8000 yr BP, whereas later the range did not extend farther westward to the Aleutians until after 4000 yr BP. In the Western Pacific, migration front refugia in Japan, by contrast, is not readily evident. aside from attitudinally higher movement in the mountains of Honshu and Hokkaido. Failure to migrate in the Western Pacific can be explained by the isolation of populations. distantly removed from habitats at higher latitudes, and by past and present climatic conditions, physical barriers, and volcanic activity. | ['heusser', 'igarashi'] | ","['heusser', 'igarashi']",0
150,"Quaternary Vertebrate Faunas of Canada and Alaska and Their Suggested Chronological Sequence | Canadian and Alaskan Quaternary vertebrate faunas (31), ranging in age from about 1,800,000-5000 yr B.P., are reviewed against a background of some of the major characteristics of the ice age in northern North America, and an attempt is made to outline their chronological sequence. For each fauna a list of species is given, and the following points are dealt with where possible: suggested geological age, stratigraphy at the site, paleoenvironmental implications and pertinent references. Where interest seems to warrant it, single species or specimens are discussed. Radiocarbon dates on bone from Pleistocene vertebrates or from associated organic material are included. Significant features of the faunas are reviewed from oldest to youngest and in relation to several faunas of similar age from northeastern Siberia [USSR] and the Great Plains of the USA. Early man is mentioned briefly. Evidence suggests that people were present in the northern Yukon [Canada] about 27,000 yr ago and perhaps even earlier than 32,000 yr ago in southern Alberta. | ['harington'] | ",['harington'],4
151,"Radiocarbon chronology and environment of woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius Blum.) in northern Asia: results and perspectives | This paper reviews the history of the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius Blum.) in Siberia and adjacent northern Asia. The particular emphases are the chronology and environment of mammoth existence and extinction, based on about 530 radiocarbon dates from about 230 localities with mammoth remains and palaeoenvironmental records of the last 50,000 years. Until ca. 12,000 radiocarbon years ago (BP), mammoths inhabited all of northern Asia, from the High Arctic to southern Siberia and northeastern China. Since ca. 12,000 BP, mammoth disappeared from major parts of Siberia and adjacent nor-them Asia, and survived mainly in the Arctic regions of Siberia, north of 69degrees northern latitude. However, recently, it was found that some mammoth populations continued to exist in central and southern Western Siberia until ca. 11, 100-10,200 BP. 'Normal' size mammoths became extinct in mainland Siberia at the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, ca. 9700 BP. On Wrangel Island in the Hi-h Arctic, small-sized mammoths survived into the Middle-Late Holocene, ca. 7700-3700 BP. Compared with previous studies, it is now possible to reveal the complex nature of the process of final mammoth extinction in Siberia, with some small populations surviving outside of the Arctic until ca. 10,000 BP. The extinction of mammoth was most probably caused by a combination of factors, such as global warming in the Late Glacial (since ca. 15,000 BP) and the disintegration of landscapes suitable for mammoths throughout the Upper Pleistocene, such as light forests with vast open spaces occupied by meadows and forest tundra. The expansion of forest vegetation after the Last Glacial Maximum in Siberia, including its northeastern part, created unsuitable habitats for herbivorous megafauna, especially for mammoths. However, the Holocene environment of Wrangel Island was not of 'glacial' type and this requires further studies. The relationship between mammoths and Upper Palaeolithic humans is also considered. The role of humans in the process of mammoth extinction was of secondary importance. The lack of direct evidences of mammoth hunting limits the estimation of its role in Upper Palaeolithic human subsistence. Siberia is undoubtedly the area where the final extinction of mammoth occurred, and the future study of this process is important to understand the patterns of Pleistocene megafaunal extinction in the Northern Hemisphere.

153,"New radiocarbon-dated vertebrate fossils from Herschel Island: Implications for the palaeoenvironments and glacial chronology of the beaufort sea coastlands | Palaeontological research on Herschel Island, Yukon, has yielded a diverse collection of Quaternary marine and terrestrial vertebrate fossils. The terrestrial faunal remains, which have largely been collected as allochthonous beach debris at Pauline Cove, are dominated by Yukon horse (Equus sp.), with fewer specimens of steppe bison (Bison priscus), proboscideans (Mammuthus primigenius and a single Mammut americanum specimen), and other large and medium-sized mammals. This pattern of a horse-dominated Late Pleistocene fauna is consistent with those from the North Slope of Alaska and further demonstrates that conditions in northernmost Beringia were more arid than those in interior areas such as Fairbanks or the Klondike. This paper presents new AMS radiocarbon dates on terrestrial vertebrate fossils and peat from the island that span the range from greater than 53 000 to modern 14C yr BP. When considered with other data from the region, our new radiocarbon-dated fauna cannot adequately resolve whether the Herschel Island ice-thrust ridge was formed during the Early Wisconsinan or the Late Wisconsinan advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet over the Yukon Coastal Plain. ¬© The Arctic Institute of North America. | ['gregory', 'hare', 'storer', 'zazula'] | ","['gregory', 'hare', 'storer', 'zazula']",4
154,"The Ranges of Mammals in the Urals at the End of the Late Pleistocene | The range dynamics of mammals in the Urals at the end of the Late Pleistocene are described as based on data from numerous fossil localities. Four types of distribution ranges are distinguished: constant, increasing, declining, and fluctuating. All eurytopic species, a number of steppe ones, all tundra species, as well as representatives of the mammoth complex had constant ranges. Range expansions during the gradual climate warming in the Late Glacial Transition period took place mainly in species associated with tree and shrub vegetation or with aquatic habitats. The ranges of forested steppe, steppe and semi-desert species were reduced by shifting the northern border southward or as a result of extinction during the transition from Interstadial to the Last Glacial Maximum period of the Late Pleistocene. The group of mammals with fluctuating ranges included species associated with tree and shrub vegetation, one near-water and one steppe species. The northern range limits in the coldest stage of the Late Pleistocene shifted southward, while in the Late Glacial Transition period they regained their former boundaries or advanced northward. | ['bachura', 'kosintsev'] | ","['bachura', 'kosintsev']",0

Based on these data, we can extend the 'Siberian' Early Holocene habitat of giant deer at least 2400 km to the east compared to previous works.

Five fauna types were distinguished among the fossil local faunas known at present. Throughout the Late Pleistocene only tundra-steppe faunas existed in the North Urals, which differed in time and space mainly by relative abundances of three dominant species Dicrostonyx gulielmi, Microtus gregalis and Lemmus sibiricus, and in some cases by species diversity. Early and Middle Holocene faunas reflect a transition from communities characteristic of tundra-steppe to forest and, in particular, taiga environments. Late Holocene faunas have a typical taiga character. Tendencies of temporal dynamics of faunas correlate with those revealed for other parts of the Urals. Differences between faunas of the different slopes (western and eastern) of the North Urals can be explained by the same factors which determine the different climate conditions there at present.

166,"Serpentine Hot Springs, Alaska: results of excavations and implications for the age and significance of northern fluted points | The dispersal of Homo sapiens across the New World is one of the greatest chapters in the history of our species; however, major questions about this late Pleistocene diaspora remain unanswered. Two contentious issues are the timing of colonization of the Bering Land Bridge and origin of Clovis, which at 13,000 calendar years ago is the earliest unequivocal complex of archaeological sites in temperate North America, known by its specialized fluted spear points. One hypothesis is that fluting technology emerged in Beringia and from there was carried southbound, with fluted points becoming the diagnostic ""calling card"" of early Paleoindians spreading across the Western Hemisphere. Fluted points have long been known from Alaska, yet until now they have never been found in a datable geologic context, making their relationship to Clovis a mystery. Here we show that a new archaeological site at Serpentine Hot Springs, Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Alaska, contains fluted points in a stratified geologic deposit dating to no earlier than 12,400 calendar years ago. Our results suggest that Alaska's fluted-point complex is too young to be ancestral to Clovis, and that it instead represents either a south-to-north dispersal of early Americans or transmission of fluting technology from temperate North America. These results suggest that the peopling of the Americas and development of Paleoindian technology were much more complex than traditional models predict. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

167,"Arctic Siberia: refuge of the Mammoth fauna in the Holocene | Global climate change at the end of Pleistocene led to extinction in the huge territories of Northern Eurasia of the typical representatives of the Mammoth fauna: mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, wild horse, bison, musk-ox, and cave lion. Undoubtedly the Mammoth fauna underwent pressure from Upper Paleolithic humans, whose hunting activity could also have played a role in decreasing the number of mammoths and other representatives of megafauna. Formerly it was supposed that the megafauna of the ""Mammoth complex"" had become extinct by the beginning of the Holocene. Nevertheless the latest data indicate that extinction of the Mammoth fauna was significantly delayed in the north of Eastern Siberia. In the 1990s some radiocarbon dates established that mammoths existed in the Holocene on Wrangel Island-from 7700 until 3700 yBP. Radiocarbon data show that wild horses inhabited the north of Eastern Siberia 4600-2000 yBP. Muskoxen lived here about 3000 yBP. Some bison remains from Eastern Siberia belong to the Holocene. The following circumstances could promote the survival of representatives of Mammoth fauna. Cool and dry climate in this region promotes the maintenance of steppe associations-the habitats of those mammals. Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic settlements are not found in the Arctic zone of Eastern Siberia from Taimyr Peninsula to the lower Yana River; they are very rare in basins of the Indigirka and Kolyma Rivers. The small number of Stone Age hunting tribes in the northern part of Eastern Siberia was probably another factor that contributed to the survival of some Mammoth fauna representatives.

171,"The spread of deciduous Quercus throughout Europe since the last glacial period | For most of the last glacial period, which ended about 10 ka BP2, the temperate forest species were restricted to small areas (termed refugia) with a milder climate, situated mostly along the Mediterranean borderlands and around the Black Sea. Species only started to expand from these glacial period refugia with the large-scale shifts in the global climate in the late-glacial (15-10 ka BP) and the beginning of the Holocene period (10 ka BP to present). Fossil pollen data from sites across Europe have been used to reconstruct the location of refugia of the deciduous oak species, and the spread from these refugia into their current ranges. Three areas of southern Europe have been identified as refugia for deciduous Quercus: southern Iberian peninsula, southern Italian peninsula and the southern Balkan peninsula. The spread of Quercus took place in two steps. First, in the late-glacial interstadial (13-11 ka BP) Quercus spread to the central European mountains from these refugia. Second, with the stabilisation of a climate favourable to deciduous trees species in the Holocene, oak spread into northern Europe, rapidly into the north-west, and more slowly into the centre and east, due to physical barriers. The earlier distribution changes are strongly correlated with the shifts in climate, whereas the later changes are most strongly controlled by competition between species, landscape topography and other edaphic factors. By approximately 6 ka BP, the deciduous oak had reached its maximum extension in Europe. Two types of refugia have been identified from the observed range expansion: primary, full glacial refugia; and secondary, temporary refugia, which supported populations of the oak during the short, climatically unfavourable late-glacial stadial. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

172,"State of stratigraphic knowledge of Quaternary deposits in European Russia: Unresolved issues and challenges for further research | The paper is devoted to summary and analysis of the Quaternary stratigraphic investigations and state of the stratigraphic schemes of the different regions of the European part of Russia. The previous summary on the Quaternary of Russia was done in 1984. Thus, this paper presents a brief analysis of the state of the Quaternary investigations in European Russia for the first time since last 30 years. Paper describes history of the Quaternary investigations of the European Russia as well as zoning (structural-facies zones) of the territory in correlation with the conditions of the Quaternary sedimentation. Summary of the Quaternary deposits developed in each zone and validity of stratigraphic units as well as state of the Regional Quaternary schemes is given for each structural-facies zone. Regional schemes are correlated with units of the General Stratgraphic chart of Russia and with International Chart. Analysis of the stratigraphic knowledge on the Quaternary deposits in various structural-facies zones in the European part of Russia has enabled to formulate the unresolved and discussable points and direction for the future investigations of the Quaternary studies. 1. Due to the change of boundary between the Neogene and Quaternary systems and involvement of the Palaeopleistocene stage in the Quaternary, stratigraphic horizons in this interval require additional study, and the most representative sequences should be selected as unit stratotypes for different zones. 2. In the areas of ice cover, various opinions on the age and number of glacial horizons in the Upper-Middle Neopleistocene, their distribution boundaries are still debatable. 3. In some areas and regions (Fore-Caucasus, Caucasus, Urals, Black Sea), differentiation of continental deposits is poorly substantiated by fauna. Their stratification is based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions, geomorphological analysis, and comparison with substantiated by fauna marine sequences of Ponto-Caspian Sea or continental sequences in the Fore-Urals and Western Siberia. Here, the most urgent task is to search for and study sequences in the transitional zone incorporating continental, ingressive, and marine sediments. 4. Development of regional charts for the Quaternary is relevant for the Caucasus, the Black Sea coast regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

175,"Sub-fossil beetle assemblages associated with the ""mammoth fauna"" in the Late Pleistocene localities of the Ural Mountains and West Siberia | The distribution of beetles at the end of the Middle Pleninglacial (=terminal Quaternary) was examined based on sub-fossil material from the Ural Mountains and Western Siberia, Russia. All relevant localities of fossil insects have similar radiocarbon dates, ranging between 33,000 and 22,000 C-14 years ago. Being situated across the vast territory from the southern Ural Mountains in the South to the middle Yamal Peninsula in the North, they allow latitudinal changes in beetle assemblages of that time to be traced. These beetles lived simultaneously with mammals of the so-called ""mammoth fauna"" with mammoth, bison, and wooly rhinoceros, the often co-occurring mega-mammalian bones at some of the sites being evidence of this. The beetle assemblages found between 59 degrees and 57 degrees N appear to be the most interesting. Their bulk is referred to as a ""mixed"" type, one which includes a characteristic combination of arcto-boreal, boreal, steppe and polyzonal species showing no analogues among recent insect complexes. These peculiar faunas seem to have represented a particular zonal type, which disappeared since the end of the Last Glaciation to arrive here with the extinction of the mammoth biota. In contrast, on the sites lying north of 60 degrees N, the beetle communities were similar to modern sub-arctic and arctic faunas, yet with the participation of some sub-boreal steppe components, such as Poecilus ravus Lutshnik and Carabus sibiricus Fischer-Waldheim. This information, when compared with our knowledge of synchronous insect faunas from other regions of northern Eurasia, suggests that the former distribution of beetles in this region could be accounted for both by palaeo-environmental conditions and the impact of grazing by large ruminant mammals across the so-called ""mammoth savannas"". | ['zinovyev'] | ",['zinovyev'],4

180,"A new terrestrial palaeoenvironmental record from the Bering Land Bridge and context for human dispersal | Palaeoenvironmental records from the now-submerged Bering Land Bridge (BLB) covering the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present are needed to document changing environments and connections with the dispersal of humans into North America, Moreover, terrestrially based records of environmental changes are needed in close proximity to the re-establishment of circulation between Pacific and Atlantic Oceans following the end of the last glaciation to test palaeo-dimate models for the high latitudes. We present the first terrestrial temperature and hydrologic reconstructions from the LGM to the present from the BLB's south-central margin. We find that the timing of the earliest unequivocal human dispersals into Alaska, based on archaeological evidence, corresponds with a shift to warmer/wetter conditions on the BLB between 14700 and 13500 years ago associated with the early Balling/Aliened interstadial (BA), These environmental changes could have provided the impetus for eastward human dispersal at that time, from Western or central Beringia after a protracted human population standstill. Our data indicate substantial climate-induced environmental changes on the BLB since the LGM, which would potentially have had significant influences on megafaunal and human biogeography in the region. | ['belmecheri', 'bigelow', 'choy', 'cwynar', 'davy', 'graham', 'kurek', 'langdon', 'medeiros', 'potter', 'rawcliffe', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'wang', 'williams', 'wooller'] | ","['belmecheri', 'bigelow', 'choy', 'cwynar', 'davy', 'graham', 'kurek', 'langdon', 'medeiros', 'potter', 'rawcliffe', 'saulnier', 'talbot', 'wang', 'williams', 'wooller']",4
181,"The timing and effect of the earliest human arrivals in North America | The peopling of the Americas marks a major expansion of humans across the planet. However, questions regarding the timing and mechanisms of this dispersal remain, and the previously accepted model (termed 'Clovis-first')-suggesting that the first inhabitants of the Americas were linked with the Clovis tradition, a complex marked by distinctive fluted lithic points(1)-has been effectively refuted. Here we analyse chronometric data from 42 North American and Beringian archaeological sites using a Bayesian age modelling approach, and use the resulting chronological framework to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns of human dispersal. We then integrate these patterns with the available genetic and climatic evidence. The data obtained show that humans were probably present before, during and immediately after the Last Glacial Maximum (about 26.5-19 thousand years ago)(2,3)but that more widespread occupation began during a period of abrupt warming, Greenland Interstadial 1 (about 14.7-12.9 thousand years beforead 2000)(4). We also identify the near-synchronous commencement of Beringian, Clovis and Western Stemmed cultural traditions, and an overlap of each with the last dates for the appearance of 18 now-extinct faunal genera. Our analysis suggests that the widespread expansion of humans through North America was a key factor in the extinction of large terrestrial mammals.A Bayesian age model suggests that human dispersal to the Americas probably began before the Last Glacial Maximum, overlapping with the last dates of appearance for several faunal genera. | ['becerra', 'valdivia', 'higham'] | ","['becerra', 'valdivia', 'higham']",4
182,"Did tree-Betula, Pinus and Picea survive the last glaciation along the west coast of Norway? A review of the evidence, in light of Kullman (2002) | Aim We discuss the hypotheses proposed by Kullman [Geo-Oko21 (2000) 141; Nordic Journal of Botany21 (2001) 39; Journal of Biogeography29 (2002) 1117] on the basis of radiocarbon-dated megafossils of late-glacial age from the central Swedish mountains that boreal trees survived the glaciation along the south-west coast of Norway and subsequently migrated eastward early in the late-glacial to early deglaciated parts of the central Swedish Scandes mountains.Methods We assess these hypotheses on the basis of glacial geological evidence and four lines of palaeoecological evidence, namely macrofossil records of the tree species, vegetation and climate reconstructions from plant evidence, independent climate reconstructions from other proxies for the late-glacial environment of south-west Norway, and the patterns of post-glacial spread of the tree species.Location South and west Norway, central Swedish Scandes mountains (Jamtland).Results and conclusions South-west Norway and the adjacent continental shelf were under ice at the last-glacial maximum (LGM). The late-glacial vegetation of south-west Norway was treeless and summer temperatures were below the thermal limits for Betula pubescens Ehrh., Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst. Instead of spreading immediately after the onset of Holocene warming, as might have been expected if local populations were surviving, B. pubescens showed a lag of local arrival of 600 to > 1000 years, Pinus lagged by 1500 to > 2000 years, and Picea only reached southern Norway c. 1500 years ago and has not colonized most of south-west Norway west of the watershed. Glacial geological evidence shows the presence of an ice sheet in the Scandes at the LGM and in the Younger Dryas, which was cold-based near or at the area where the late-glacial-dated megafossils were recovered by Kullman. We conclude that the samples dated by Kullman (2002) should be evaluated carefully for possible sources of contamination. All the available evidence shows that the biogeographical hypotheses, based on these radiocarbon dates taken at face value, of late-glacial tree survival at the Norwegian coast and subsequent eastwards spread to the mountains, are unsupportable. | ['birks', 'birks', 'larsen'] | ","['birks', 'birks', 'larsen']",1
183,"Valdaian glacial maxima in the Arkhangelsk district of northwestern Russia | The marginal configurations and ages of the Valdaian (Weichselian) glacial maxima in northern Russia have hitherto not been well established, thus, numerous versions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) positions of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet are known (Fig.1B). New data on ice sheet growth and decay indicate at least three glacial maxima during the Late Pleistocene each with individual spreading centres and different ages. Results of modern investigations in the Arkhangelsk region, conducted by the authors, are compared with an analysis of previous data on the Late Quaternary geology of Northwest Russia, which comprises a thorough presentation of Russian literature on this subject. This has allowed us to question and revise former models on Valdaian glaciation history and icemarginal positions in a major part of the Russian North. An Early-Middle Valdaian (c. 70 ka BP) glaciation from the east and southeast, possibly originating on the Timan ridge, crossed the Pyoza River basin and reached the White Sea coast along the Bay of Mezen. The southern terminus of the ice sheet is probably found along parts of the Mezen River (Fig. 2 A,B). The presence of an Early-Middle Valdaian Scandinavian glaciation, which covered the Arkhangelsk region and in neighbouring areas of Karelia and Vologda is not supported by geological data. In the Middle Valdaian (c. 60 ka BP) an ice sheet from the Barents-Kara Sea flowed from the north, northeast and reached the lower Pyoza River and the south and western shores of Mezen Bay on the White Sea coast. The terminal formations of its maximal stage stretch from west to east just north of Pyoza River and then run marginal to the Timan ridge from the north joining with the Markhida endmoraines on the Pechora Lowland (Fig. 2 A,B). During the Late Valdaian, the Scandinavian Ice Sheet occupied the northwestern part of the Arkhangelsk region around 19-17 ka BP. The limit of this Late Valdaian glacial maximum runs from the White Sea shore of the Kanin Peninsula in the north, along the Kuloi River south of Mezen to the Middle Pinega River, crossing the rivers Severnaya Dvina and Vaga near the villages of Cherevkovo and Ust-Padenga. The glacial boundary bordered the Melovian and Nyandoma high ground and continued southwestwards to Lake Kubenskoe in the Vologda region. The Pyoza, Mezen and Vashka river basins remained icefree during the Late Valdaian time, this area being covered by fluvial flood plains, with abundant evidence of permafrost and lakes. The latter have yielded pollen evidence indicating an arctic to subarctic environment between 18-20 ka BP (Fig. 2 A,B). ¬© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The section includes the lower member of sandy loam rich in ice, presumably accumulated in the late glacial time. The upper peat member was accumulated between 8 and 4 ka ago. The rough boundary between peat and oxbow-lake loams with cryoturbation marks suggests a hiatus in sedimentation between 10.9 and 8.2 ka ago. The age of deposits was determined by the radiocarbon method. The results of palynological analysis reveal several phases of vegetation development in the study area and specify their time limits. We believe that the Allerod warming period was more favorable than the Middle Holocene for the development of arboreal-fritucose vegetation in the region now occupied by typical tundras. This is likely a result of the sea level rise at the end of the late Pleistocene and in the first half of the Holocene up to altitudes somewhat exceeding the recent level, when the influence of the ocean upon climate and vegetation was enhanced.

188,"Views on the Late Weichselian and the Early Holocene dispersal of insects and other biota in NW Europe | The history of the last glaciation is fundamental to the present biota in NW Europe. However, our insight into various periods of the Weichselian as well as the dispersal of biota during the Late Pleistocene and the Early Holocene is still fragmentary in many respects. For instance, new radiocarbon dates from Finnish subfossil mammoths indicate much larger ice-free areas in Fennoscandia during the Middle Weichselian 32 000 to 22 500 yr BP than previously assumed. Large areas of the Kola Peninsula and northern coast of Scandinavia (Finnmark) deglaciated already during the Late Glacial interstadial 13 000 to 11 500 yr BP and the Kanin-Kola dispersal route has been very important for the Fennoscandian arctic and subarctic fauna and flora. After the Late Glacial stadial (the Younger Dryas chronozone) the climate ameliorated rapidly about 10 200 yr BP and arctic and subarctic species dissappeared quite suddenly in southern Fennoscandia and new more thermophilous species colonized the areas. Many species previously suggested to be survivors in glacial refugia in Scandinavia obviously had not colonized Scandinavia prior to the Late Weichselian. Yet, fairly recent fossil records of aquatic insects and other invertebrates during 22 000 to 13 000 yr BP on Andoya in the Atlantic coast of NW Norway indicate the survival of the fauna in ice-free refugia during the Weichselian maximum. Alvar biotopes in the islands of Oland, Gotland and Saaremaa (Osel) as well as certain shore areas of the Baltic Sea, especially those of the Gulf of Bothnia and even some esker biotopes are edaphic and physiognomic ""relict"" habitats of the Early Holocene biota.

189,"In the Wake of Prehistoric North Pacific Sea Mammal Hunters | Examination of faunal and artifactual data from several archaeological sites in the Aleutian Islands, the Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula, and Kodiak Island reveals evidence of a prehistoric exchange or interaction pattern at least as early as Late Kachemak/early Koniag times [c. 1200 years ago]. There is increasing evidence that this apparent exchange/interaction network coincided with important distributions and migratory habits of many of the sea mammals that were exploited by native populations. I propose that the exchange of material items and cultural ideas resulted from systematic movements of maritime subsistence hunters from various ethnic groups of the North Pacific rim. These sea hunters possessed similar technology and used similar hunting practices in very similar coastal environments. | ['holland'] | ",['holland'],4
190,"Weichselian interstadial pollen stratigraphy from a Veiki plateau at Rissejauratj in Norrbotten, northern Sweden | The Quaternary history of northern Sweden as known today is based on studies on glacial landforms and Quaternary deposits. In these studies the north-eastern part of the County of Norrbotten has been of special interest since landform systems of different age occur in the region. This article focuses on Veiki moraine, a type of hummocky moraine of pre-Late Weichselian age. Veiki moraine has a distinct distribution pattern, showing the ice margin of a decaying pre-Late Weichselian ice. A sediment core from within a Veiki moraine plateau at Rissejauratj was studied by means of pollen analysis. The pollen assemblages at Rissejauratj are dominated by Betula pollen and correlate with spectra from the warmest Weichselian interstadial periods recognised at other sites in northern Sweden. The Rissejauratj sequence can be correlated to either (1) the middle part of the first Weichselian interstadial (Tarendo I), (2) the early phase of the second Weichselian interstadial (Tarendo II), or (3) the late phase of the second Weichselian interstadial (Tarendo II). If alternative 3 is correct the ice sheet that formed the Veiki moraine was small and probably did not reach outside the eastern limit of Veiki moraine distribution. | ['hattestrand'] | ",['hattestrand'],4

They also have the potential to reveal surprises related to unforeseen events and non-stationary dynamics that unfold over the course of ongoing observation and experimentation. The unprecedented rate and magnitude of current and expected abiotic changes in tundra environments calls for a synthetic overview of the scope of ecological responses these changes have elicited. In this special issue, we present a series of contributions that advance the long view of ecological change in tundra systems, either through sustained long-term research, or through retrospective or prospective modelling. Beyond highlighting the value of long-term research in tundra systems, the insights derived herein should also find application to the study of ecological responses to environmental change in other biomes as well. | ['hoye', 'post'] | ","['hoye', 'post']",0

4,"Atlantic SSTs control regime shifts in forest fire activity of Northern Scandinavia | Understanding the drivers of the boreal forest fire activity is challenging due to the complexity of the interactions driving fire regimes. We analyzed drivers of forest fire activity in Northern Scandinavia (above 60 N) by combining modern and proxy data over the Holocene. The results suggest that the cold climate in northern Scandinavia was generally characterized by dry conditions favourable to periods of regionally increased fire activity. We propose that the cold conditions over the northern North Atlantic, associated with low SSTs, expansion of sea ice cover, and the southward shift in the position of the subpolar gyre, redirect southward the precipitation over Scandinavia, associated with the westerlies. This dynamics strengthens high pressure systems over Scandinavia and results in increased regional fire activity. Our study reveals a previously undocumented teleconnection between large scale climate and ocean dynamics over the North Atlantic and regional boreal forest fire activity in Northern Scandinavia. Consistency of the pattern observed annually through millennium scales suggests that a strong link between Atlantic SST and fire activity on multiple temporal scales over the entire Holocene is relevant for understanding future fire activity across the European boreal zone. | ['ali', 'bergeron', 'drobyshev', 'moberg', 'niklasson', 'de', 'vernal'] | ","['ali', 'bergeron', 'drobyshev', 'moberg', 'niklasson', 'de', 'vernal']",1

6,"The boreal forest | Describes the vegetation of the continuous belt of high latitude forest which stretches from C Labrador across Canada to parts of Alaska, noting salient climatic, geological, glacial and edaphic factors. This vegetation is a complex mosaic of different plant communities, though almost all are dominated by coniferous trees. Bogs and meadows are found throughout. Changes in dominant taxa are seen latitudinally, but there are no clearly defined discontinuities. The forest canopy becomes more open and generally shorter northwards, with a transition from closed forest to open lichen woodland to scattered trees of the forest-tundra ecotone. Seven boreal forest regions are characterised floristically. Comments are made on succession and the role of fire in community dynamics, and productivity is reported (net primary productivity ranging from 400-2000 g m2 yr-1, mean 800 g m-2 yr-1, low compared with other global biomass).

7,"Boreal forests and soils | The boreal forest is a circumpolar zone governed by climate and characterized by strong seasonal variation. It encompasses more than 30% of the Earth's forests and a significant portion of remaining intact forest landscapes. On geological scales, glacial and postglacial events have shaped the development of boreal ecosystems. The boreal zone is also driven by natural disturbance regimes that influence biogeochemical cycling and landscape composition. Most of the boreal forest is spread among only a small number of countries, but is subjected to different kinds of human activities, including logging and mining. Impacts of climate change are likely to be pronounced in the boreal forest, with projected increases in both temperature and aridity. Of particular concern is the effect of climate change on the capacity of boreal soils to act as carbon sinks, the potential release of carbon currently stored in frozen soils, and the cumulative effects of human activities and climate on the resilience of boreal ecosystems. At the same time, boreal forests hold a significant potential for climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and carbon substitution by harvested wood products. | ['thiffault'] | ",['thiffault'],1

11,"Charcoal reflectance reveals early Holocene boreal deciduous forests burned at high intensities | Wildfire size, frequency, and severity are increasing in the Alaskan boreal forest in response to climate warming. One of the potential impacts of this changing fire regime is the alteration of successional trajectories, from black spruce to mixed stands dominated by aspen, a vegetation composition not experienced since the early Holocene. Such changes in vegetation composition may consequently alter the intensity of fires, influencing fire feedbacks to the ecosystem. Paleorecords document past wildfire-vegetation dynamics and as such, are imperative for our understanding of how these ecosystems will respond to future climate warming. For the first time, we have used reflectance measurements of macroscopic charcoal particles (>180 micro m) from an Alaskan lake-sediment record to estimate ancient charring temperatures (termed pyrolysis intensity). We demonstrate that pyrolysis intensity increased markedly from an interval of birch tundra 11 ky ago (mean 1.52%Ro; 485 degrees C), to the expansion of trees on the landscape ~10.5 ky ago, remaining high to the present (mean 3.54%Ro; 640 degrees C) irrespective of stand composition. Despite differing flammabilities and adaptations to fire, the highest pyrolysis intensities derive from two intervals with distinct vegetation compositions. (1) the expansion of mixed aspen and spruce woodland at 10 cal. kyr BP, and (2) the establishment of black spruce, and the modern boreal forest at 4 cal. kyr BP. Based on our analysis, we infer that predicted expansion of deciduous trees into the boreal forest in the future could lead to high intensity, but low severity fires, potentially moderating future climate-fire feedbacks. | ['belcher', 'hu', 'hudspith', 'kelly'] | ","['belcher', 'hu', 'hudspith', 'kelly']",1

13,"Climate, soil organic layer, and nitrogen jointly drive forest development after fire in the North American boreal zone | Previous empirical work has shown that feedbacks between fire severity, soil organic layer thickness, tree recruitment, and forest growth are important factors controlling carbon accumulation after fire disturbance. However, current boreal forest models inadequately simulate this feedback. We address this deficiency by updating the ED2 model to include a dynamic feedback between soil organic layer thickness, tree recruitment, and forest growth. The model is validated against observations spanning monthly to centennial time scales and ranging from Alaska to Quebec. We then quantify differences in forest development after fire disturbance resulting from changes in soil organic layer accumulation, temperature, nitrogen availability, and atmospheric CO2. First, we find that ED2 accurately reproduces observations when a dynamic soil organic layer is included. Second, simulations indicate that the presence of a thick soil organic layer after a mild fire disturbance decreases decomposition and productivity. The combination of the biological and physical effects increases or decreases total ecosystem carbon depending on local conditions. Third, with a 4 degrees C temperature increase, some forests transition from undergoing succession to needleleaf forests to recruiting multiple cohorts of broadleaf trees, decreasing total ecosystem carbon by approximate to 40% after 300 years. However, the presence of a thick soil organic layer due to a persistently mild fire regime can prevent this transition and mediate carbon losses even under warmer temperatures. Fourth, nitrogen availability regulates successional dynamics; broadleaf species are less competitive with needleleaf trees under low nitrogen regimes. Fifth, the boreal forest shows additional short-term capacity for carbon sequestration as atmospheric CO2 increases. | ['bergeron', 'fenton', 'medvigy', 'trugman', 'welp', 'xu'] | ","['bergeron', 'fenton', 'medvigy', 'trugman', 'welp', 'xu']",1
14,"Climate-vegetation-fire interactions and their impact on long-term carbon dynamics in a boreal peatland landscape in northern Manitoba, Canada | Climate warming may increase the size and frequency of fires in the boreal biome, possibly causing greater carbon release that amplifies warming. However, in peatlands, vegetation change may also control long-term fire and carbon accumulation, confounding simple relationships between climate, fire, and carbon accumulation. Using 17 peat cores dating to 8000 cal years B. P. from northern Manitoba, Canada, we addressed the following questions: (1) Do past climate changes correlate with shifts in peatland vegetation? (2) What is the relationship between peatland vegetation and fire severity? (3) What is the mean return interval for boreal peat fires, and how does it change across fires of different severities? (4) How does fire severity affect carbon accumulation rates? (5) Do fire and long-term carbon accumulation change directly in response to climate or indirectly though climate-driven changes in vegetation? We measured carbon accumulation rates, fire severity, and return intervals using macroscopic charcoal and changes in vegetation using macrofossils. Climate and vegetation changes covaried, with shifts from wetter fen to drier, forested bog communities during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). Fires became more severe following the shift to forested bogs, with fire severity peaking after 4000 cal years B. P. rather than during the HTM. Rising fire severity, in turn, was correlated with a significant decrease in carbon accumulation from similar to 6000 to 2000 cal years B. P. The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age affected vegetation composition and permafrost, further impacting fire and carbon accumulation. Our results indicate that long-term changes in fire and carbon dynamics are mediated by climate-driven changes in vegetation. | ['andreassi', 'barry', 'camill', 'limmer', 'solick', 'williams'] | ","['andreassi', 'barry', 'camill', 'limmer', 'solick', 'williams']",1
15,"Comparison of Siberian paleovegetation to current and future vegetation under climate change | To see if the Holocene optimum (4600 to 6000 yr before present) is an analogue for predicted future climate, a comparison was made between Siberian paleovegetation for this Late Atlantic Period and predicted Siberian vegetation under climate change. Siberian paleovegetation is also compared to a current landscape map of Siberia. The Siberian Vegetation Model was used to estimate Siberian vegetation under climate change scenarios resulting from CO2 doubling. Both visual and statistical analysis of the maps indicate that the warm period known as the Holocene optimum does not provide a good analogy to predicted future warming. Although the predicted rise in temperature with future warming is similar to the Holocene optimum, the predicted precipitation is much less, resulting in much more temperate forest-steppe vegetation than the forest vegetation found in the past. The current climatic regime is cooler and more severe than 4600 to 6000 yr ago. -from Authors | ['denissenko', 'monserud', 'tchebakova'] | ","['denissenko', 'monserud', 'tchebakova']",0
16,"Competitive interaction between aspen and birch moderated by invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores and climate warming | Background: Considerable changes in vegetation structure and distribution are predicted in high latitude ecosystems as a result of amplified climate change. However, some documented plant community changes do not follow model predictions. Aim: We compared the growth of and the responses to climate variation by the thermophilic aspen (Populus tremula) and its sub-Arctic competitor mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) over the past 100 years. Methods: Repeat photography, high-resolution vegetation transects, dendro-ecological analysis, and local climate record archives were used to study changes in vitality and distributional range of the two tree species in response to climate variability. Results: Aspen grew 45% faster and had seven times higher recruitment numbers than birch. However, no aspen stand expansion was observed, most likely because of browsing by moose (Alces alces). Birch, on the other hand, suffered from cyclic outbreaks of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata). One-hundred-year-old birch trees experienced on average 9.0 years of reduced growth due to moth herbivory compared to 1.4 years for aspen. Moreover, these moth outbreaks on birch stimulated recruitment of aspen in birch stands. Conclusions: As the sub-Arctic continues to become warmer, the dynamics between aspen and birch in forest ecosystems will likely depend on the number of vertebrate browsers relative to the number of aspen recruits, while major moth outbreaks on birch may facilitate the spread of aspen by reducing competition. Our results suggest that alternating episodes of apparent species range stabilities (homeostasis) and abrupt non-linear shifts may characterise species migration patterns in this ecosystem. ¬© 2009 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis. | ['callaghan', 'jonasson', 'de', 'dapper', 'van', 'bogaert'] | ","['callaghan', 'jonasson', 'de', 'dapper', 'van', 'bogaert']",1
17,"Coniferization of the mixed-wood boreal forests under warm climate | Mixed-wood boreal forests are characterized by a heterogeneous landscape dominated by coniferous or deciduous species depending on stand moisture and fire activity. Our study highlights the long-term drivers of these differences between landscapes across mixed-wood boreal forests to improve simulated vegetation dynamics under predicted climate changes. We investigate the effects of main climate trends and wildfire activities on the vegetation dynamics of two areas characterized by different stand moisture regimes during the last 9000 years. We performed paleofire and pollen analyses in the mixed-wood boreal forest of north-western Ontario, derived from lacustrine sediment deposits, to reconstruct historical vegetation dynamics, which encompassed both the Holocene climatic optimum (ca. 8000‚Äì4000 a bp) and the Neoglacial period (ca. 4000 a bp). The past warm and dry period (Holocene climatic optimum) promoted higher fire activity that resulted in an increase in coniferous species abundance in the xeric area. The predicted warmer climate and an increase in drought events should lead to a coniferization of the xeric areas affected by high fire activity while the mesic areas may retain a higher broadleaf abundance, as these areas are not prone to an increase in fire activity.

18,"Consequences of climatic thresholds for projecting fire activity and ecological change | Aim Ecological properties governed by threshold relationships can exhibit heightened sensitivity to climate, creating an inherent source of uncertainty when anticipating future change. We investigated the impact of threshold relationships on our ability to project ecological change outside the observational record (e.g., the 21st century), using the challenge of predicting late-Holocene fire regimes in boreal forest and tundra ecosystems. Location Boreal forest and tundra ecosystems of Alaska. Time period 850-2100 CE. Major taxa studied Not applicable. Methods We informed a set of published statistical models, designed to predict the 30-year probability of fire occurrence based on climatological normals, with downscaled global climate model data for 850-1850 CE. To evaluate model performance outside the observational record and the implications of threshold relationships, we compared modelled estimates with mean fire return intervals estimated from 29 published lake-sediment palaeofire reconstructions. To place our results in the context of future change, we evaluate changes in the location of threshold to burning under 21st-century climate projections. Results Model-palaeodata comparisons highlight spatially varying accuracy across boreal forest and tundra regions, with variability strongly related to the summer temperature threshold to burning: sites closer to this threshold exhibited larger prediction errors than sites further away from this threshold. Modifying the modern (i.e., 1950-2009) fire-climate relationship also resulted in significant changes in modelled estimates. Under 21st-century climate projections, increasing proportions of Alaskan tundra and boreal forest will approach and surpass the temperature threshold to burning, with > 50% exceeding this threshold by > 2 degrees C by 2070-2099. Main conclusions Our results highlight a high sensitivity of statistical projections to changing threshold relationships and data uncertainty, implying that projections of future ecosystem change in threshold-governed ecosystems will be accompanied by notable uncertainty. This work also suggests that ecological responses to climate change will exhibit high spatio-temporal variability as different regions approach and surpass climatic thresholds over the 21st century. | ['abatzoglou', 'duffy', 'higuera', 'hu', 'young'] | ","['abatzoglou', 'duffy', 'higuera', 'hu', 'young']",1

22,"(Development of the Finnish forest landscape) | A century ago the composition of forests of southern Finland was greatly affected by shifting cultivation and grazing and, as their consequence, frequent forest fires. In the 1920's, forests were still primarily young and the proportion of deciduous trees was high. Thereafter, as a consequence of forest management and elimination of fires, the proportion of spruce greatly increased and that of deciduous trees decreased, and a more even age class distribution has been attained. This development is most clearly seen in eastern Finland. In northern Finland the human influence had been much less and therefore old forests dominated in 1920's. Along with regeneration of old forests, a rather even age class distribution has now been attained. Old spruce forests have often been clear-felled and replaced with new generation of pine. Various activities of intensive forest management, wetland drainage and road building also have changed the Finnish forest landscapes.-from English summary | ['mikola'] | ",['mikola'],2
23,"Dissimilar responses of larch stands in northern Siberia to increasing temperatures-a field and simulation based study | Arctic and alpine treelines worldwide differ in their reactions to climate change. A northward advance of or densification within the treeline ecotone will likely influence climate-vegetation feedback mechanisms. In our study, which was conducted in the Taimyr Depression in the North Siberian Lowlands, w present a combined field-and model-based approach helping us to better understand the population processes involved in the responses of the whole treeline ecotone, spanning from closed forest to single-tree tundra, to climate warming. Using information on stand structure, tree age, and seed quality and quantity from seven sites, we investigate effects of intra-specific competition and seed availability on the specific impact of recent climate warming on larch stands. Field data show that tree density is highest in the forest-tundra, and average tree size decreases from closed forest to single-tree tundra. Age-structure analyses indicate that the trees in the closed forest and forest-tundra have been present for at least similar to 240 yr. At all sites except the most southerly ones, past establishment is positively correlated with regional temperature increase. In the single-tree tundra, however, a change in growth form from krummholz to erect trees, beginning similar to 130 yr ago, rather than establishment date has been recorded. Seed mass decreases from south to north, while seed quantity increases. Simulations with LAVESI (Larix Vegetation Simulator) further suggest that relative density changes strongly in response to a warming signal in the forest-tundra while intra-specific competition limits densification in the closed forest and seed limitation hinders densification in the single-tree tundra. We find striking differences in strength and timing of responses to recent climate warming. While forest-tundra stands recently densified, recruitment is almost non-existent at the southern and northern end of the ecotone due to autecological processes. Palaeo-treelines may therefore be inappropriate to infer past temperature changes at a fine scale. Moreover, a lagged treeline response to past warming will, via feedback mechanisms, influence climate change in the future. | ['epp', 'heinrich', 'herzschuh', 'jeltsch', 'kolmogorov', 'kruse', 'nikolaev', 'pestryakova', 'wieczorek', 'zibulski'] | ","['epp', 'heinrich', 'herzschuh', 'jeltsch', 'kolmogorov', 'kruse', 'nikolaev', 'pestryakova', 'wieczorek', 'zibulski']",2
24,"Disturbance history of a swamp forest refuge in Northern Sweden | Swedish swamp forests have a considerable conservation value because of their rich biodiversity which includes many threatened species. They have been interpreted as refugia from fire with long histories of forest continuity. Palaeoecological investigation of a small swamp forest in northern Sweden shows that the forested area was under cultivation 500 years ago. The present forest has only developed during the last 300 years as a consequence of changes in land-use. Palaeoecology can be used to test assumptions about stability, disturbance and 'natural' vegetation. Results from such studies suggest that communities are highly dynamic, and conservation policy should create a framework within which dynamic processes can operate, in addition to species preservation. Our method is a potentially valuable tool in the formulation of future nature conservation policy. | ['bohlin', 'bradshaw', 'hornberg', 'segerstrom'] | ","['bohlin', 'bradshaw', 'hornberg', 'segerstrom']",0
25,"Dwarf tundra shrubs growth as a proxy for late Holocene climate change | The Arctic is the most sensitive zone to climate changes and the impacts are reflected in local ecosystems. In order to extract information of the past from proxy archives the detailed knowledge of such archive is crucial. The paper summarizes modern approaches of tundra dwarf shrub research for the purposes of paleoclimatology. Dwarf tundra shrubs as still relatively untapped archive are believed to contain valuable proxy data in their annual growth increments. Field sampling, and laboratory work are reviewed in detail. Constraints of dwarf tundra shrub research are discussed as well. The relationship between climate and growth is addressed to find a link between them depending on location and species. Majority of investigations found the strongest relationship between summer temperatures and ring widths, although exceptions are not rare. Dwarf tundra shrubs can fully serve as valuable proxy archive only if those are understood. Finally, the factors influencing the length of dwarf tundra shrub life are studied in order to sample the oldest living individuals in the field. Despite the field collection should aim to sample various sizes and ages of plants to make the dataset robust, the longest living individuals which are important to prolong chronologies are usually inhabiting rather nutrient poor and undisturbed sites close to their survival limits. The paper indicates the most suitable dwarf tundra shrub research designs for the purposes of paleoclimatology. As such it can help to harvest the benefits of dendrochronology from the vast and new territories. | ['lehejƒçek'] | ",['lehejƒçek'],0
26,"The holocene dynamics of jack pine at its northern range limit in Quebec | 1. The postglacial history of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) at its northernmost distribution limit in the upper boreal forest, along the Grande Riviere de la Baleine (northern Quebec), was reconstructed by using radiocarbon-dated conifer macrofossils found in dune palaeosols. 2. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) was the first conifer species to colonize the area at 6000 BP, immediately after deglaciation. Jack pine first invaded the sandy terraces at 3050 BP, apparently at a low density. The species most likely survived for several centuries at this low density before experiencing a regional expansion between 2400 and 1750 BP. 3. From the period of regional expansion of jack pine to the present, mixed and monospecific stands of jack pine and black spruce developed concurrently, indicating that both species responded positively to fire and climate conditions. 4. The regional expansion of jack pine was not followed by a northward spread of the species into the forest tundra. The formation and expansion of the forest tundra during the last 3000 years restricted jack pine to the boreal forest. A lower fire frequency with colder conditions in the forest tundra may have been responsible for the inability of jack pine to expand northwards. | ['desponts', 'payette'] | ","['desponts', 'payette']",3
27,"Ecological characterization of northernmost birch forests and treeline ecotones in Norway | Aims: The current paper focuses on quantifying ground vegetation, estimating age, distribution and ecological conditions in 28 birch forest stands. Another key objective of this study was to investigate whether these forests are temperature limited. We also determined if there were any significant differences in ecological conditions between forest, scattered trees and shrub plots. Study area: Sampling was conducted in northernmost birch forests (dominated by Betula pubescens) found along the coast in Finnmark (Norway). These forest limits are used to delimit the boreal biome from the alpine/arctic biome and are assumed to have a bioclimatic characterization. Methods: Soil and air temperatures were measured within selected stands and soil samples and tree cores were collected. Results: The results showed the field layer to be dominated by Empetrum-Cornus-Vaccinium, Polytrichum-Cornus and Cirsium-Viola types; the gradients between these types being explained by pH, July temperatures and thaw days. Based on the tree-ring data, the age of the trees was estimated to be 1177 yr. Elevated levels of calcium were evident in some of the study plots. Conclusions: We found no differences in temperature conditions and soil properties between forests, scattered trees and shrubby stands (with the exception of potassium concentration). The overall temperature conditions in present study were warmer than in other northern limit of birch forests. This suggests, that forests are probably not limited by temperature conditions, but more likely limited by strong wind, topography and absence of land further north. However, more data is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. | ['bandekar', 'odland'] | ","['bandekar', 'odland']",1

In many ecosystems non-human ignitions are overwhelmed by anthropogenic ignitions. Human population density, culture, and topographic factors are quantitatively related to fire regimes and the long-term pattern in fire frequency and species composition. These factors can be quantitatively related and used to reconstruct and predict the frequency of fire in ecosystems and to identify changing factors involved in anthropogenic fire regimes. Quantitative fire histories from oak-pine sites in Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, and Ontario are used to examine patterns of interaction in fuels, ignitions, and topography over a period of 300 years. Fire regimes and fire frequencies are associated with the abundance of many species of reptiles, birds, fungi, and plants.

31,"Effects of large herbivores on tundra vegetation in a changing climate, and implications for rewilding | In contrast to that of the Pleistocene epoch, between approximately 2.6 million and 10 000 years before present, the extant community of large herbivores in Arctic tundra is species-poor predominantly due to human extinctions. We here discuss how this species-poor herbivore guild influences tundra ecosystems, especially in relation to the rapidly changing climate. We show that present herbivore assemblages have large effects on tundra ecosystem composition and function and suggest that the effect on thermophilic species expected to invade the tundra in a warmer climate is especially strong, and that herbivores slow ecosystem responses to climate change. We focus on the ability of herbivores to drive transitions between different vegetation states. One such transition is between tundra and forest. A second vegetation transition discussed is between grasslands and moss-and shrub-dominated tundra. Contemporary studies show that herbivores can drive such state shifts and that a more diverse herbivore assemblage would have even higher potential to do so. We conclude that even though many large herbivores, and especially the megaherbivores, are extinct, there is a potential to reintroduce large herbivores in many arctic locations, and that doing so would potentially reduce some of the unwanted effects of a warmer climate.This article is part of the theme issue 'Trophic rewilding: consequences for ecosystems under global change'. | ['olofsson', 'post'] | ","['olofsson', 'post']",1

33,"The environment they lived in: anthropogenic changes in local and regional vegetation composition in eastern Fennoscandia during the Neolithic | Understanding about regional versus local changes in vegetation is critical in answering archaeological questions, in particular at a time when humans are assumed to have caused higher disturbances at local scales rather than regional scales; this is the case during the Neolithic. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of Neolithic land use on regional and local vegetation dynamics, plant composition and disturbance processes (e.g. fire) in eastern Fennoscandia. We apply the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) to high-resolution pollen records from three lacustrine sediment cores that cover the Neolithic period. We calculate changes in vegetation composition and the rate of plant compositional change. Fire dynamics are estimated as an indicator of land use, although fire can result from both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Our results show that during the Early Neolithic, changes were mainly driven by natural and climate-induced factors and vegetation composition and fire activity were similar at both regional and local scales. From ca. 4000 BC onwards, trends in vegetation and fire dynamics start to differ between regional and local scales. This is due to local land uses that are overshadowed at the regional scale by climate-induced factors. The use of the LOVE model in pollen analyses is therefore very useful to highlight local land uses that are not visible by using REVEALS. | ['alenius', 'heikkila', 'marquer', 'molinari', 'ojala'] | ","['alenius', 'heikkila', 'marquer', 'molinari', 'ojala']",2

Three new pollen records from the forest-tundra zone were combined with ten previously-published records to form a transect of paleoecological data across this treeline. The area was deglaciated similar to 6-7 ka, with only a brief period of shrub tundra vegetation in the oldest sediments of all sites. Noticeable values of Populus, Juniperus and Larix pollen percentages were found during this time in the southernmost sites, suggesting they comprised part of the initial plant migration. Maximum Picea pollen percentages were found between 2 and 4 ka across the boreal forest and forest-tundra, with values remaining constant in the boreal forest and decreasing in the forest-tundra in the past 3 ka. Across the entire area, pollen influx decreased in the past 4 ka, and non-arboreal pollen increased in the forest-tundra, suggesting an opening of the forest and decrease in terrestrial production. Charcoal influx also declined, indicating a reduction in fire activity in the past 2-4 ka. Although the treeline has remained in the same average location in the region over the past 6 ka, the strength of the temperature gradient across the frontal zone changed over the course of the Holocene.

35,"Exploring climatic and biotic controls on Holocene vegetation change in Fennoscandia | 1. We investigated the potential drivers of Holocene vegetation changes recorded at four Scandinavian pollen sites, two in Sweden and two in Finland, at a time when they were largely free of anthropogenic influence.2. We used the generalized dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS forced with climate anomaly output from an atmospheric general circulation model to simulate tree species dynamics from 10 000 years ago to the present. The model results were compared to high-resolution pollen accumulation rates gathered at the sites.3. Our results indicate that both the observed northern distributional limits of temperate trees, and the limits of Pinus sylvestris and Alnus incana at the tree line, are a result of millennial variations in summer and winter temperatures. The simulation of several distinct trends in species occurrence observed in the pollen record indicates that a time lag due to the slow spreading of species need not be invoked for most species.4. Sensitivity studies indicate that competition, natural disturbance and the magnitude of interannual variability play key roles in determining the biomass, establishment and even the presence of species near their bioclimatic limits. However, neither disturbance due to fire nor limits on establishment due to drought were likely to have been major determinants of the observed trends on the timescales considered.5. We were unable to limit the modelled occurrence of Picea abies at the study sites to the periods at which it was observed in the pollen records, indicating that we have still not completely understood the driving or limiting factors for Holocene changes in Picea abies abundance.6. Synthesis. This study shows that by combining quantitative vegetation reconstructions with a modern, process-based dynamic vegetation model, we may gain new insights into the potential biotic and abiotic drivers of Holocene vegetation dynamics, and their relative importance. This knowledge will be crucial in enabling us to assess more confidently the response of northern European vegetation to future climate change. | ['bradshaw', 'giesecke', 'hickler', 'miller', 'seppa', 'smith', 'sykes', 'valdes'] | ","['bradshaw', 'giesecke', 'hickler', 'miller', 'seppa', 'smith', 'sykes', 'valdes']",1

37,"Fire, death and disorder in the forest: 150 years of change in critical ecological structures and processes in boreal Scandinavia. (IUFRO Research Series, vol. 10) | The history of the boreal forest of Scandinavia (Sweden) is characterized by very low human population density and relatively late impact by modern forestry. The coniferous boreal forest has changed dramatically since the late 19th century, which, in turn, has resulted in loss of biodiversity. Some of the most important ecological changes include fire suppression, loss of dead and dying trees, and loss of multi-storeyed old-growth forest. These changes warrant, among other things, restoration efforts on different spatial scales in order to enhance and protect biodiversity for the future. | ['ostlund'] | ",['ostlund'],2
38,"Holocene fire history of middle boreal pine forest sites in eastern Finland | A Holocene fire history of dry heath forests of Cladina and Empetrum-Vaccinium types in eastern Finland was reconstructed on the basis of charcoal layer data from two small mire basins and fire scars in living and dead pines. In addition, charcoal layers at two sites at the margin of a large mire were surveyed. Charcoal layers are indisputable evidence of in situ fires on the mire and provide a reliable fire record in the forest site adjacent to the studied peat deposits. Natural fire frequency was considerably lower than is usually assumed. The charcoal layer data indicate no more than 43 and 42 fires at the two dry forest sites during the whole Holocene period prior to any significant human influence. In natural conditions after the establishment of spruce (about 6300 cal. BP) Cladina and Empetrum-Vaccinium sites burned at an average interval of 170-240 years, which is 3-8 times longer than the average intervals of 30-50 years put forward in fire scar studies covering the past few centuries. At the other site seven charcoal layers could be dated to the time after about AD 1500, when extensive human influence started in the area. The data indicate changes in fire frequency linked with major climatic changes at the transition of the Boreal and Atlantic, and of the Atlantic and Subboreal chronozones (around 9000 and 6300 cal. BP, respectively). The data suggest no increase in natural fires due to the anticipated recent global climatic warming in Fennoscandia. | ['huttunen', 'jungner', 'merilainen', 'pitkanen', 'tolonen'] | ","['huttunen', 'jungner', 'merilainen', 'pitkanen', 'tolonen']",0
39,"Fire as an important factor for the genesis of boreal Picea abies swamp forests in Fennoscandia | The initial establishment of Picea abies in Sweden and Norway on a landscape level, between 3000 and 1000 years ago, was often preceded by recurrent fire and thereafter the influence of fire decreased. However, in some swamp forests, the absence of fire over the last 3500 years has promoted the continuous presence of deciduous trees, i.e. Picea has not established although it has been present regionally for over 3000 years. Our objective was to study long-term vegetation development and fire history in a Picea swamp forest located close (c. 600 m) to a deciduous swamp forest with a documented fire-free history in northernmost Sweden. The study included analyses of charred particles, pollen and ignition residues. Principal component analysis was applied to identify major changes in the pollen spectra. Our results showed that the current Picea swamp forest has developed from a deciduous fen and that fires affected the fen between 6700 and 2300 cal. yr BP. Picea abies established on the fen around 2200 cal. yr BP, following the last local on-site fire. The main factors responsible for the local vegetation development have been: fire (6700 to 2300 cal. yr BP); autogenous processes and climate (2300 to 1000 cal. yr BP); autogenous processes or anthropogenic impact (1000 to 300 cal. yr BP); anthropogenic impact through selective cutting and grazing (300 to 100 cal. yr BP); and autogenous processes and grazing (100 cal. yr BP to present). We conclude that fire facilitated the initial Picea abies establishment. Once established, Picea abies created local conditions that in combination with a colder and wetter climate prevented fire and the establishment of other tree species. | ['hornberg', 'korsman', 'nordstrom', 'segerstrom', 'staland'] | ","['hornberg', 'korsman', 'nordstrom', 'segerstrom', 'staland']",1
40,"Fire and lichen dynamics in the Taiga Shield of the Northwest Territories and implications for barren-ground caribou winter forage | Questions: Fire is the main disturbance agent in boreal forests and has profound effects on vegetation composition and structure, including terrestrial lichens that provide critical winter forage for barren-ground caribou. What is the influence of fire on forest structure and the distribution and species assemblage of forage lichens? What is the current or potential effect of climate change on forage lichen in the boreal forest?. Location: High Boreal, Low Subarctic, and High Subarctic ecoregions of the Taiga Shield Ecozone in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Methods: We used fire history data, satellite and air photo images, and field sampling to determine fire history and severity, and subsequent effects on tree and lichen species composition, in a 880,000¬†ha study area in the winter range of the Bathurst caribou herd. Results: We found that low- and mixed-severity fires were more common than high-severity fires, and that forest fire severity increased with distance to treeline. Forest structure and composition were more important drivers of lichen cover than fire severity or time since fire. Conclusions: While fire had a dominant role in forest structure and composition, the effects on lichen availability were due more to variation in tree growth. We found little evidence of changes in fire regime over the length of our reconstructions (approximately 200¬†years); however, increases in temperature and the positive relationship between temperature and fire frequency may lead to shortened fire cycles causing a reduction in the availability of forage lichens through burning. ¬© 2019 International Association for Vegetation Science | ['johnson', 'karim', 'lewis'] | ","['johnson', 'karim', 'lewis']",2
41,"Fire in managed forests of eastern Canada: risks and options | In this era of climate change, understanding past and predicting future fire activity are scientific challenges that are central to the development of sustainable forest management practices and policies. Such objectives, however, are difficult to achieve for several reasons. Uncertainties about future fire activity can be superimposed on the short time period covered by existing meteorological data and fire statistics, from which a historical range of variability can be determined. Regional fire activity is also tremendously variable over time, such that contemporary fire records cannot provide information on the full range of fire activity variability a given forest experienced and adapted to. This factor is increasingly important when it comes to determining the resilience of boreal forests to changes in climate and disturbance regimes. In this paper, we present a synthesis of past, present and future trends in seasonal fire danger and fire activity based on data gathered in eastern Canadian boreal forests over the last 20 years, and we provide a critical assessment of the ability to conduct sustainable forest management over the 21st century. The data synthesis provides compelling evidence of a synchronous pattern of decreasing fire-conducive climatic conditions and activity of large fire seasons over the last 2000 years in the eastern coniferous boreal forest. Model simulations suggest that the climate will become drier in upcoming decades, driving future fire activity close to the upper bound of the pre-industrial range of variability. The effects of increasing fire incidence cumulated with forest harvesting may thus pose a risk to forest resilience in the future. This ecological knowledge should help us to define forest management strategies and practices considering future fire activity changes forecasted under climate change. Development of alternative silvicultural interventions that would emulate secondary disturbances (e.g. wind, insects) rather than fire would be necessary to maintain pre-industrial forest characteristics (e.g. composition and age class distribution), and associated forest resilience. | ['ali', 'bergeron', 'carcaillet', 'gauthier', 'girardin', 'goff', 'hely', 'terrier'] | ","['ali', 'bergeron', 'carcaillet', 'gauthier', 'girardin', 'goff', 'hely', 'terrier']",1
42,"An 840-year record of fire and vegetation in a boreal white spruce forest | Boreal forest fire and vegetation history was examined using an 840-yr fossil pollen and charcoal record from a site dominated by Picea glauca in Alberta, Canada. The record was created using continuous 5-yr samples of annually laminated sediments from a 2.7-ha lake (Rainbow Lake A in Wood Buffalo National Park). Following a peak in the microscopic charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR), there is a sequence of peaks in sediment thickness and in 14 of the 21 common pollen and spore taxa. The general pollen sequence is an initial peak in herbs, then shrubs, then deciduous trees, and finally conifers and Sphagnum. The peak value for each taxon differs following individual fires, suggesting that a site does not undergo the same postfire vegetation sequence following all fires. Based on the CHAR, pollen, and sediment thickness records, at least 12, large, local fires are apparent. The average time interval between the 12 fires is 69 yr. Significant periodicities in CHAR and in II of the pollen taxa range between 95 and 185 yr. These estimates of the mean fire interval are broadly similar to the 71-142 yr fire cycle for Picea glauca forests, estimated by dendrochronological analysis of regional forests. The pollen taxa also exhibit long-term changes in relative abundance. An initial dominance by Picea cf. glauca is terminated by a fire around AD 1185 and is replaced by Populus dominance between AD 1250 and 1550; the fire is followed by an 800-yr period of increasing abundance of Picea cf. glauca. Herbs and shrubs generally exhibit a peak in abundance between AD 1350 and 1750. These long-term patterns may reflect climatic change, response to fires with different characteristics, or rearrangement of the forest patches around Rainbow Lake A. | ['larsen', 'macdonald'] | ","['larsen', 'macdonald']",0

Finland showed regional variations in climate with the passage of time, both in areas where the birch treeline has moved upwards and where it has remained stable. Dendrochronological analysis of Betula tortuosa showed that the upward migration was primarily caused by a rise in temp. between 1930 and 1940. In some areas the decreasing influence of upland grazing was an important factor for the rising birch treeline. In coastal regions, thickness and duration of snow cover played a significant part. Polycormic birch trees were characteristic of areas with a rising treeline, whereas monocormic trees were characteristic of areas where the treeline had remained stable. | ['treter'] | ",['treter'],2

Forest age (maximum tree age) was determined and charcoal and fire scars were searched for in 43 randomly located study plots. In 70% of the study plots (30/43) trees older than 200 years existed. The largest 50-year age class consisted of plots with 251-300 year old forests. Traces of fires were found in all types of study plots, in forests on mineral soil as well as on peatlands. However, fire has been a rare disturbance factor, as traces of fires could not be found in 35% of the study plots (15/43). Estimated from the forest age class distribution, the fire rotation time for the whole area has been at least 300 years, but possibly considerably longer. This fire rotation time is much longer than fire history studies (largely based on examination of fire scars) commonly have reported for the average time between successive fires in Fennoscandia and Northwest Russia. The results suggest that the often stated generalisations about the importance and natural frequency of fire disturbance in boreal forests do not apply in landscapes dominated by Picea abies. | ['wallenius'] | ",['wallenius'],0

47,"Forest landscape structure influences the cyclic-eruptive spatial dynamics of forest tent caterpillar outbreaks | A fundamental question in forest insect ecology is the role of forest landscape structure, particularly the amount and spatial configuration of host tree species, in shaping the dynamics of recurring forest insect outbreaks. For forest tent caterpillar (FTC), independent studies do not converge on a singular conclusion, although all indicate that forest structure influences outbreak dynamics. These studies also vary in how they treat climate as a covariate. We evaluated the relative importance of host forest landscape composition and configuration, as well as climate, for their influence on FTC outbreak cycling in the twentieth century. We predicted that FTC outbreaks would exhibit greater synchrony and intensity within areas associated with higher abundance of host trees. We reconstructed FTC outbreaks from 1928 to 2006 using tree-ring analysis within a well-structured experimental landscape located in northwestern Ontario and northern Minnesota. Time-series clustering and spatial nonparametric covariance were used to determine whether similarities in time series and patterns in spatial synchrony corresponded with land management history. Using constrained ordination, we compared statistical properties of outbreak time series to landscape variables representing host abundance, forest configuration, and climate. We found no evidence of climatic effects at the scale of this study, but a significant albeit small influence of landscape structure on outbreak dynamics. Outbreaks were more synchronous and more cyclic within managed zones containing a greater relative abundance of aspen and other hardwood host tree species, compared with the more conifer-dominated Wilderness area. Yet, we also observed asynchronous outbreak dynamics across the study area, such that correlations with slower-changing forest landscape variables varied starkly among outbreak pulses. Consequently, the strength of relationship between landscape variables and FTC outbreak patterns varied strongly through time-a result that may explain why short-term studies yield conclusions that are at odds with one another. Our results speak to the importance of long time series, contrasting landscape structure, use of multivariate methods, and controlling for climatic variation when investigating the effects of forest landscape structure on the cyclic-eruptive spatial dynamics for forest defoliators. | ['cooke', 'fortin', 'james', 'kneeshaw', 'robert', 'sturtevant', 'townsend', 'wolter'] | ","['cooke', 'fortin', 'james', 'kneeshaw', 'robert', 'sturtevant', 'townsend', 'wolter']",0
48,"Forest succession and climate variability interacted to control fire activity over the last four centuries in an Alaskan boreal landscape | ContextThe boreal forest is globally important for its influence on Earth's energy balance, and its sensitivity to climate change. Ecosystem functioning in boreal forests is shaped by fire activity, so anticipating the impacts of climate change requires understanding the precedence for, and consequences of, climatically induced changes in fire regimes. Long-term records of climate, fire, and vegetation are critical for gaining this understanding.ObjectivesWe investigated the relative importance of climate and landscape flammability as drivers of fire activity in boreal forests by developing high-resolution records of fire history, and characterizing their centennial-scale relationships to temperature and vegetation dynamics.MethodsWe reconstructed the timing of fire activity in interior Alaska, USA, using seven lake-sediment charcoal records spanning CE 1550-2015. We developed individual and composite records of fire activity, and used correlations and qualitative comparisons to assess relationships with existing records of vegetation and climate.ResultsOur records document a dynamic relationship between climate and fire. Fire activity and temperature showed stronger coupling after ca. 1900 than in the preceding 350yr. Biomass burning and temperatures increased concurrently during the second half of the twentieth century, to their highest point in the record. Fire activity followed pulses in black spruce establishment.ConclusionsFire activity was facilitated by warm temperatures and landscape-scale dominance of highly flammable mature black spruce, with a notable increase in temperature and fire activity during the twenty-first century.

In northern Fennoscandia a rare forest type, characterized by Cladina species and Picea abies, occurs on dry productive sites outside the range of permafrost but close to the Scandes mountains. 2. We determined the history of vegetation development and disturbance of two Picea-Cladina forests to test the hypothesis that this forest type has a natural origin. 3 We used a combination of several retrospective vegetation history and archaeological methods, i.e. the analysis of pollen, macroscopic charcoal, dendroecological data, written historical sources, maps and ancient remains. 4 The results suggest that the Picea-Cladina forests investigated are not the products of purely natural factors. 5. Under the influence of harsh climatic conditions and anthropogenic impact, mainly by repeated fires, grazing, trampling and probably also selective cutting of Pinus, mixed coniferous forests, dominated by feather mosses and dwarf shrubs, may have evolved into the Picea-Cladina type. 6 . Repeated anthropogenic use of fire, already established c. 2000 years ago, may have been used to create lichen-dominated areas, initially to attract game but later to improve winter grazing resources for reindeer.

52,"Geographic and temporal variations in fire history in boreal ecosystems of Alaska | Charcoal and pollen analyses were used to determine geographic and temporal patterns of fire importance in boreal forests of the Kenai Peninsula and interior Alaska. Sieved, large charcoal particles were measured in continuously sampled cores of Rock, Portage, and Arrow Lakes (Kenai Peninsula) and Dune and Deuce Lakes (interior Alaska) to estimate regional fire importance and fire occurrence. Charcoal accumulation rates have been low for the past 1000 years in both regions with slightly higher values in interior Alaska than on the Kenai Peninsula. An exception to this general pattern was the period of post-European settlement on the Kenai Peninsula, where charcoal accumulation rates increased by 10-fold. This increase most likely reflected increased fire occurrence due to human ignition. The Holocene charcoal and pollen records from Dune Lake indicate low fire occurrence during the early (9000 to 5500 calibrated year before present (yr BP)) birch-white spruce-alder (Betula-Picea glauca-Alnus) communities and high fire occurrence as black spruce (Picea mariana) became established after 5500 yr BP. Increased fires probably resulted from a change to fire-prone black spruce forests. For the past 5500 yr BP, two distinct fire regimes occurred. Frequent fires, with an average fire return interval of 98 years, characterized the period from 5500-2400 yr BP. Fewer fires, with an average fire interval of 198 years, characterized the period after 2400 yr BP.

54,"Historical logging, productivity, and structural characteristics of boreal coniferous forests in Norway | Conservation of forest biodiversity has brought about an interest in evaluating the naturalness of forests, and to locate and protect semi-natural and old-growth forests in the Fennoscandian countries. However, it is not always clear how natural these forests really are, and how the past management history has affected their present structural composition. We studied the relationships between cut stumps from historical logging activity (50-100 years ago) and forest structural characteristics of today in a total of 385 0.25 ha plots in three boreal coniferous forests which are parts of National Nature Reserves in Norway. We also studied how forest productivity influenced these relationships. In plots with negligible logging impact we found the amount of living trees, dead wood, and size of the oldest trees mainly to increase with increasing productivity, whereas the age of the oldest trees decreased. The amount of deciduous trees was generally low irrespective of productivity. The intensity of logging did not consistently influence most of these forest structural variables, neither at low- nor at high-productive sites. The only consistent relationship in all study areas was a decreasing amount of dead wood with increasing logging intensity at high-productive sites. Also, the decay class distribution of dead wood was more right-skewed (indicating on-going accumulation of dead wood) the more logging had occurred at high-productive sites. Except from the effects on dead wood, previous logging does not show up as a major determinant of other stand structures of today. | ['gjerde', 'gundersen', 'rolstad', 'storaunet'] | ","['gjerde', 'gundersen', 'rolstad', 'storaunet']",2

The impact of fire on vegetation changes was evaluated using detailed analysis of plant macrofossils. Compared to upland boreal forest, fire incidence in these Sphagnum-dominated bogs is rather low. Past fire occurrence seems to have been controlled primarily by internal processes associated with local hydroseral succession. Size of the peatland basin and distance from the well-drained forest soils also appear to be factors controlling fire occurrence. The impact of peatland fires on long-term vegetation succession appears negligible except in a forested bog, where it initiated the replacement of Sphagnum by mosses. In some circumstances, fire caused marked changes in the bryophyte assemblages over many decades. However, ombrotrophic peatland vegetation is generally resilient to surface fire.

61,"Late Quaternary variations in tree cover at the northern forest-tundra ecotone | Accurate land cover reconstructions are essential to understanding the past and present biogeochemical and biogeophysical interactions between the land surface and atmosphere and the impacts of these interactions on climate. Here we quantitatively reconstruct late Quaternary shifts in woody cover across the Northern Hemisphere forest-tundra ecotone, based on a synthesis of Northern Hemisphere pollen records and contemporary observations of woody cover from the advanced very high resolution radiometer sensor. Our reconstructions document the expansion of Northern Hemisphere forests following deglaciation and reveal significant hemispheric asymmetries in the Holocene position, steepness, and history of the forest-tundra ecotone. In western Canada, for example, forest expansion and infilling continued through the Holocene, while in much of northern Asia, forests reached their maximal expansion during the early Holocene, then retreated. The woody cover reconstructions are generally consistent with macrofossil-based reconstructions of northern tree line dynamics and complement them by extending study of the northern forest-tundra ecotone from the tree line limit (well mapped by macrofossils) to the entire ecotone. Using the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic vegetation model, we estimate that changes in northern forest density resulted in at least a 47.7 Gt C increase in aboveground carbon sequestration between 21 and 9 ka, a 13.9 Gt C increase between 9 and 6 ka, and a 3.5 Gt C loss of aboveground carbon from northern forests after 6 ka. This trajectory is consistent with atmospheric carbon isotopic measurements for the Holocene, which suggest carbon uptake by the terrestrial biosphere until 6 ka and small carbon releases from the terrestrial biosphere afterward. | ['brewer', 'notaro', 'tarasov', 'williams'] | ","['brewer', 'notaro', 'tarasov', 'williams']",1

The purpose of this study was: (1) to analyse region-wide changes in the positions of the latitudinal forest line and tree line since the early 20th century; (2) to calculate rates of northward movement and to estimate uncertainties from different sources of data; (3) to analyse how rates of advance differ between two common tree species, Betula pubescens (downy birch) and Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine); and (4) to place the results in the context of dynamic global vegetation models. Location: The study covers Finnmark county in northern Norway, which has warmed by 1-2 ¬∞C since the early 20th century. Methods: Historical forest maps, topographic maps, aerial photographs and satellite imagery were used to delineate region-wide, species-specific and time-specific subarctic forest lines and tree lines. Rates of advance were calculated using two geometrical methods, placing different emphases on the shape and mean position of the lines, but yielding similar results. Results: The analyses revealed an average northward advance of the birch and pine forest lines of 156 and 71 m year-1, respectively. Both showed considerable spatial and temporal variation. The birch tree line showed the most pronounced advance (340 m year-1), whereas the pine tree line showed very limited advance (10 m year-1). Data sources contributed an uncertainty of around 10 m year-1 to these rates. Main conclusions: The analysis of historical and recent forest delineation data showed a very restricted advance rate compared to the predictions of dynamic global vegetation models. If these results are representative of the behaviour of the entire circumarctic forest-tundra zone over the present century, they suggest that the modelled prediction of the loss of 40% of the current tundra is a serious overestimate.

Milder climatic conditions have occurred in northern Quebec, Canada, in the 20th century. The purpose of this study was to document the early signs of a northward expansion of the boreal forest into the subarctic forest-tundra, a vast heterogeneous ecotone. Colonization of upland tundra sites by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) forming local subarctic tree lines was quantified at the biome scale. Because it was previously shown that the regenerative potential of spruce is reduced with increasing latitude, we predicted that tree line advances and recent establishment of seedlings above tree lines will also decrease northwards.Location Black spruce regeneration patterns were surveyed across a > 300-km latitudinal transect spanning the forest-tundra of northern Quebec, Canada (55 degrees 29'-58 degrees 27' N).Methods Elevational transects were positioned at forest-tundra interfaces in two regions from the southern forest-tundra and two regions from the northern forest-tundra, including the arctic tree line. The surroundings of stunted black spruce, forming the species limit in the shrub tundra, were also examined. Position, total height and origin (seed or layer) of all black spruce stems established in the elevational transects were determined. Dendrochronological and topographical data allowed recent subarctic tree line advances to be estimated. Age structures of spruce recently established from seed (< 2.5 m high) were constructed and compared between forest-tundra regions. Five to 20-year heat sum (growing degree-days, > 5 degrees C) and precipitation fluctuations were computed from regional climatic data, and compared with seedling recruitment patterns.Results During the 20th century, all tree lines from the southern forest-tundra rose slightly through establishment of seed-origin spruce, while some tree lines in the northern forest-tundra rose through height growth of stunted spruce already established on the tundra hilltops. However, the rate of rise in tree lines did not slow down with latitude. The density of < 2.5-m spruce established by seed declined exponentially with latitude. While the majority of < 2.5-m spruce has established since the late 1970s on the southernmost tundra hilltops, the regeneration pool was mainly composed of old, suppressed individuals in the northern forest-tundra. Spruce age generally decreased with increasing elevation in the southern forest-tundra stands, therefore indicating current colonization of tundra hilltops. Although spruce reproductive success has improved over the twentieth century in the southern forest-tundra, there was hardly any evidence that recruitment of seed-origin spruce was controlled by 5- to 20-year regional climatic fluctuations, except for winter precipitation.Main conclusions Besides the milder 20th century climate, local topographic factors appear to have influenced the rise in tree lines and recent establishment by seed. The effect of black spruce's semi-serotinous cones in trapping seeds and the difficulty of establishment on exposed, drought-prone tundra vegetation are some factors likely to explain the scarcity of significant correlations between tree establishment and climatic variables in the short term. The age data suggest impending reforestation of the southernmost tundra sites, although the development of spruce seedlings into forest might be slowed down by the harsh wind-exposure conditions. | ['gamache', 'payette'] | ","['gamache', 'payette']",2
64,"Local versus regional processes: can soil characteristics overcome climate and fire regimes by modifying vegetation trajectories? | We analysed charcoal and pollen from sediments obtained from two lakes in the northwestern mixed-wood Canadian boreal forest in order to reconstruct fire-return intervals and vegetation dynamics over the last 8000 years. Sites were selected with contrasting soil properties (mesic versus dry-sandy soils), allowing an estimation of the potential influence of soils on long-term vegetation and fire dynamics. The sites likely experienced fewer fires during the period extending from 8000 to 4000 cal. a BP than over the last 4000 years. At both sites, eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) populations were most extensive shortly after deglaciation, with vegetation later shifting towards mixed woodlands with less P. strobus and more extensive Picea and Pinus banksiana populations. This gradual vegetation shift was probably induced by the establishment of colder and moister conditions along with a fire-regime change. In spite of the parallel long-term vegetation trajectories, vegetation composition differed between the two sites in both the past and present. Whereas Picea was more abundant at the mesic site, the fire-adapted P. banksiana populations were more extensive at the sandy-soil site. These differences in vegetation composition indicate that, in addition to climate changes and fire occurrence, soil properties also influenced vegetation dynamics. A likely increase in fire frequency in the Canadian boreal forest during the 21st century might therefore favour the expansion of these two disturbance-adapted trees with spatial heterogeneity in the populations due to varying soil types.

65,"Long fire cycle in northern boreal Pinus forests in Finnish Lapland | Knowledge of past forest fire regimes is important for developing management plans for conservation areas and for predicting the probable effects of forest management and climate change on the structure and dynamics of forests. In this study, fire scars on living and dead trees were systematically sampled on 256 study plots in three landscapes in north-eastern Finland dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). A total of 1030 disks or partial cross sections from different trees, including scars from 98 distinct forest fires, were dendrochronologically dated with an accuracy of 1 year or better. The extraordinarily well-preserved old Pinus snags and stumps allowed us to reconstruct annual tree-ring and fire chronologies beginning from the year AD 653. The fire cycles in the studied landscapes were exceptionally long for a boreal region dominated by Pinus, on average 350 years during the last millennium. This demonstrates that the fire regimes of poorly studied remote regions cannot be extrapolated from fire regimes of sites examined in more detail. Based on statistics on lightning-ignition densities, we suggest that most of the fires detected in this study were ignited by humans. The reconstructed past fire cycles were probably shortened by human influence. | ['herva', 'kauhanen', 'pennanen', 'wallenius'] | ","['herva', 'kauhanen', 'pennanen', 'wallenius']",1
66,"Long-term differences in the dynamics within a natural forest landscape - consequences for management | Palaeoecological methods were used to study forest dynamics at stand and landscape scales in the Pechoro-Ilych Zapovednik in the Komi Republic in Russia. A survey of charcoal bands in peat deposits at 36 sites on a 160 km(2) area showed that the greater part of the landscape has burnt regularly. Here the landscape is dominated by Scots pine on dry soil. There are, however, Nor-way spruce sites, with a high permanent water table and with tall herb vegetation without traces of fire. Stand-scale, hi.-h-resolution pollen studies at one pine and one spruce site were consistent with the landscape results. Charcoal bands and fire-driven succession were observed at the pine site, whilst the spruce site had no evidence of fire during at least the last 2600 years. This study shows that the main part of this natural landscape has been regularly affected by fire, but also that there are networks of stands at a landscape scale that form stable fire-free refuge with a continuous forest cover. The presence of such a strong contrast in disturbance regimes within one landscape has important implications for the management of biological diversity in forestry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

67,"Long-term forest composition and its drivers in taiga forest in NW Russia | Understanding the processes behind long-term boreal forest dynamics can provide information that assists in predicting future boreal vegetation under changing environmental conditions. Here, we examine Holocene stand-scale vegetation dynamics and its drivers at the western boundary of the Russian taiga forest in NW Russia. Fossil pollen and conifer stomata records from four small hollow sites and two lake sites are used to reconstruct local vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. Variation partitioning is used to assess the relative importance of the potential drivers (temperature, forest fires and growing site wetness) to the long-term stand-scale dynamics in taiga forest. All the main tree taxa, including the boreal keystone species Picea abies (Norway spruce) and Larix sibirica (Siberian larch), have been locally present since 10,000 cal yr bp. The constant Holocene presence of L. sibirica at three small hollow sites suggests a fast postglacial immigration of the species in northern Europe. Picea was present but not dominant at all study sites until its expansion between 8,000 and 7,000 cal yr bp markedly changed the forest structure through the suppression of Betula (birch), Pinus (pine) and Larix. Our results demonstrate that in general, the Holocene forest dynamics in our study region have been driven by temperature, but during short intervals the role of local factors, especially forest fires, has been prominent. The comparison between sites reveals the importance of local factors in stand-scale dynamics in taiga forests. Therefore, the future responses of taiga forest to climate change will be predominantly modulated by the local characteristics at the site. | ['alenius', 'bradshaw', 'clear', 'filimonova', 'kuosmanen', 'kuznetsov', 'reitalu', 'seppa', 'zaretskaya'] | ","['alenius', 'bradshaw', 'clear', 'filimonova', 'kuosmanen', 'kuznetsov', 'reitalu', 'seppa', 'zaretskaya']",1
68,"Long-term succession of closed boreal forests at their range limit in eastern North America shows resilience to fire and climate disturbances | The distribution of vegetation zones in northeastern North America forms a gradual transition from closed to open forests, and to tundra. Closed forests near the open forest/tundra boundary generally correspond to residual patches of a once larger forest community. Whether these forest patches have survived as untouched, firefree communities or as resilient communities during the Holocene remains unknown. To answer to this question, we reconstructed the successional history of two black spruce closed-crown forests and one jack pine forest near the northern limit of closed forest ecosystems. Stand-scale postfire succession was analysed based on charcoal macrofossils. Extensive C-14 dating and botanical identification of charcoal fragments located at the organic soil surface and buried in the mineral podzolic solum were used to reconstruct the successional pathways of the sites. The forest sites developed in a context of continuous fire disturbance, except for a short interval of several centuries. The fire history of the three sites is similar with a fire frequency of 34-37 fires over the last 5000-5800 years, which corresponds to a mean fire interval of 150-180 years. Based on parametric and nonparametric estimators, the regional fire regime of the Laforge area (combined fire data of two sites located about 7 km from each other) was most likely characterized by 38 fires over the last 5000-5800 years, i.e., at an interval of about 150-160 years. Birch (Betula papyrifera) was present in the spruce sites between 5800 and 3000 cal. years BP. Jack pine arrived at the pine site about 3000 cal. years BP, at the time when birch was extirpated from the spruce forests. The closed-crown forests near the open forest/tundra boundary are resilient postfire ecosystems which regenerated successfully since mid-Holocene. Compositional change of these forests, which led to the decline of birch but maintained the dominance of conifers, appears related to cooler and wetter conditions of late Holocene. Climatic conditions also slowed the eastward migration of jack pine, which explains the late arrival of this species at its northeastern range. Our data suggest that fire disturbance in these sites of the boreal biome has been a continuous and positive regenerative process since mid-Holocene despite the influence of climatic change on the tree flora. | ['fregeau', 'payette'] | ","['fregeau', 'payette']",1
69,"Using machine learning to synthesize spatiotemporal data for modelling DBH-height and DBH-height-age relationships in boreal forests | Sustainable forest management requires the ability to accurately model forest dynamics under a changing environment, which is difficult using conventional statistical methods as many factors that interactively affect forest growth must be considered. As well, statistical model development is often limited by the lack of broad-scale repeated forest measurements needed to capture changes in 1 or more variables and the corresponding changes in forest dynamics (e.g., growth in diameter and height), while assuming other variables do not change, or their changes do not significantly affect the forest dynamics of interest. In many forested countries, comprehensive monitoring programs have amassed large amounts of diverse forest measurement data. Here we propose a new approach for using artificial neural network-based machine learning to synthesize spatiotemporal tree measurement data collected over a vast area of boreal forest in central Canada to model diameter at breast height (DBH)-height and DBH-height-age relationships for 6 dominant tree species. More than 30 potentially important stand structure, site, and climate variables were considered. We used an individual-based modelling approach by considering each individual tree measurement as an instance of the complex relationships modelled; together, broad-scale long-term monitoring data contain many such instances, representing considerable spatial and temporal scale variation in forest growth and growing conditions. Using this approach, we significantly improved DBH-height and DBH-height-age models. And the models developed allowed us to analyze the effects of environmental conditions or changes in these conditions on forest growth. This may be the first attempt at applying this type of approach, which can be used to more accurately model, for example, forest growth, mortality, and how they are affected by changing climate in a variety of forest types. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V. | ['chen', 'deng', 'man', 'parton', 'peng', 'sharma', 'wang', 'yang', 'zhu'] | ","['chen', 'deng', 'man', 'parton', 'peng', 'sharma', 'wang', 'yang', 'zhu']",1
70,"Major decline in fires in coniferous forests - reconstructing the phenomenon and seeking for the cause | Steep decline in forest fires about a century ago occurred in coniferous forests over large areas in North America and Fennoscandia. This poorly understood phenomenon has been explained by different factors in different regions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of the four most commonly suggested causes of the decrease in forest fires: fire fighting, over-grazing, climate change and human influence. I compiled the available dendrochronological data and estimated the annually burned proportions of Pinus-dominated forests in four subcontinental regions during the past 500 years. These data were compared to the development of fire suppression, grazing pressure, climate and human livelihoods. The annually burned proportions declined over 90% in all studied regions. In three out of the four regions fires decreased decades before fire suppression began. Available drought data are annually well correlated with fires but could not explain the decrease of the level in annually burned areas. A rapid increase in the number of livestock occurred at the same time with the decrease in fires in the Western US but not in Fennoscandia. Hence, fire suppression in Central Fennoscandia and over-grazing in the Western US may have locally contributed to the reduction of burned areas. More general explanation is offered by human influence hypothesis: the majority of the past forest fires were probably caused by humans and the decrease in the annually burned areas was because of a decrease in human caused fires. This is in accordance with the old written records and forest fire statistics. The decrease in annually burned areas, both in Fennoscandia and the United States coincides with an economic and cultural transition from traditional livelihoods that are associated with high fire use to modern agriculture and forestry. | ['wallenius'] | ",['wallenius'],2
71,"Mid- and late-Holocene vegetation history, climate and human impact in the forest-steppe ecotone of European Russia: new data and a regional synthesis | Appropriate management of contemporary environments requires knowledge of their long-term history. We use palaeoecological data to explore how contemporary forest-steppe environments have been shaped by climate change and human impacts through the Holocene using the western Mid-Russian Upland as a case-study. Our paper presents new reconstructions of Mid- and Late Holocene climate, vegetation dynamics and local environmental change based on pollen, plant macrofossil and testate amoeba records from a site at Selikhovo (Mid-Russian Upland, Russia). Eutrophic fen vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis developed around 6800 cal year BP and has been resilient to episodes of local burning and variable input of mineral material through the Holocene. New and previously-published data show that the boundary between broadleaf forest and steppe occupied a similar position to present during the period 7000-4800 cal year BP, despite a warmer and drier climate, but shifted to the south following climate cooling and an increase in precipitation from 4800-2500 cal year BP. A subsequent decline in woodland cover was caused by both climate change and human impacts, with human activity becoming increasingly significant over the last two millennia. Prior to major human disturbance (about 1700 cal year BP) the landscape was dominated by mixed broadleaf-pine forests with some spruce covering about 60 % of the study area. Our results emphasize the variability of steppe-forest habitats over long time periods and the need to consider human impacts and climate change when setting targets for habitat conservation. | ['babeshko', 'losbenev', 'mazei', 'novenko', 'olchev', 'payne', 'rudenko', 'tsyganov', 'volkova', 'zuyganova'] | ","['babeshko', 'losbenev', 'mazei', 'novenko', 'olchev', 'payne', 'rudenko', 'tsyganov', 'volkova', 'zuyganova']",1
72,"The millennial dynamics of a boreal forest stand from buried trees | 1. We reconstructed the dynamics of a black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest stand in northern Quebec using a continuous, 5200-year-long sequence of stem remains buried in adjacent peatland. Simulations of recruitment of such remains provided guidelines for inferring past ecosystem structure and composition at the stand scale. 2. Compared with the late Holocene (4650-0 cal. year BP (CYBP)), the mid Holocene (5200-4650 CYBP) period was characterized by faster tree growth, larger stems and higher stem density, indicating higher forest productivity in association with a milder climate. 3. The presence of stem remains of both species from 17 out of 20 contiguous 250-year time intervals suggests that the spruce-pine stand exhibited high compositional stability, with both species regenerating after fire from canopy-stored seed banks. 4. Relative species abundance closely followed the duration of past fire intervals deduced from the number of tree rings in buried conifers. Time periods of long (4650-3950, 3400-1850 and 250-0 CYBP) and short fire intervals (4950-4650, 3950-3400 and 1850-250 CYBP) were associated, respectively, with decreasing and increasing pine abundance, probably reflecting faster juvenile growth, lower shade tolerance, earlier sexual maturity and shorter longevity in jack pine compared with black spruce. 5. We conclude that both climate change and climate-induced fire disturbance have been driving long-term ecosystem dynamics. Our field evidence supports the idea that interactions between disturbances and the life-history traits of species modulate the impact of climate change at the scale of forest stands. At the same time, disturbances may result in long-term stability of disturbance-adapted ecosystems. | ['arseneault', 'sirois'] | ","['arseneault', 'sirois']",1
73,"Multi-century reconstruction of fire activity in Northern European boreal forest suggests differences in regional fire regimes and their sensitivity to climate | Forest fires are one of the main disturbance agents in boreal and temperate ecosystems. To decipher large-scale temporal and spatial patterns of past fire activity in Scandinavia, we analysed the synchronicity of dendrochoronologically reconstructed fire events in a large network of sites (n=62; 3296 samples, 392 individual fire years) covering a wide geographical gradient (56.5-67.0 degrees N and 9.3-20.5 degrees E) over AD 1400-1900. We identified large fire years (LFY) as years with regionally increased forest fire activity and located the geographical centres of climatic anomalies associated with synchronous LFY occurrence across the region, termed LFY centroids. The spatial pattern of LFY centroids indicated the presence of two regions with climatically mediated synchronicity of fire occurrence, located south and north from 60 degrees N. The return intervals of LFYs in Scandinavia followed a Weibull distribution in both regions. Intervals, however, differed: a period of 40 years would carry a 0.93 probability of LFY occurrence in the southern region, but only a 0.48 probability of LFY occurrence in the northern region. Over 1420-1759, the northern region was characterized by significantly higher temporal variability in LFY occurrence than the southern region. Temporal correlation of LFYs with reconstructed average summer temperature and total precipitation was evident mainly for the northern region. LFYs in this region were associated with positive temperature and negative precipitation anomalies over Scandinavia and with colder and wetter conditions in more southern parts of the European subcontinent. Synthesis. Historical patterns of the occurrence of large fire years (LFY) in Scandinavia point towards the presence of two well-defined zones with characteristic fire activity, with the geographical division at approximately 60 degrees N. The northern and mid-boreal forests, although exhibiting lower LFY frequencies, appeared to be more sensitive to past summer climate, as compared to the southern boreal forests. This would imply that fire regimes across Scandinavia may show an asynchronous response to future climate changes. | ['bergeron', 'drobyshev', 'granstrom', 'hellberg', 'linderholm', 'niklasson'] | ","['bergeron', 'drobyshev', 'granstrom', 'hellberg', 'linderholm', 'niklasson']",2
74,"Multi-cohort stand structure in boreal forests of northeastern Ontario: Relationships with forest age, disturbance history, and deadwood features | Multi-cohort forest management (MFM) is a natural disturbance emulation strategy for boreal forests that recommends a diversification of silvicultural techniques to emulate three broad successive phases of post-fire development, termed ""cohort classes"" Here, for boreal mixedwood (n = 308) and black spruce (n = 108) stands of northeastern Ontario, we: 1) present a multivariate approach to classify the three cohort classes based on a broad set of stand structural variables related to live-tree diameters, densities, and measures of canopy stratification and 2) investigate variation in stand age, mode of stand origin (including horse- And mechanically logged and natural-origin stands), and deadwood features among the cohort classes. In both forest types, average stem diameter distributions in cohort class 1 were normally distributed, those in class 2 showed broader normal distributions, and those in class 3 showed inverse-J distributions. Mean stand age increased with cohort class, and was positively correlated with cohort class in both forest types. Overall, variation in age and deadwood features as a function of cohort class in both forest types provided strong support for developmental aspects of our cohort classifications. Previously logged stands were primarily associated with lower cohort classes, whereas natural-origin stands were strongly associated with complex cohort class 3 stand structures, especially in mixedwoods. As it is primarily the silvicultural manipulation of stand structure that has been proposed to emulate age-related multi-cohort development, our structural cohort classification approach is particularly relevant to the application of MFM in Ontario. | ['kuttner', 'malcolm', 'smith'] | ","['kuttner', 'malcolm', 'smith']",0
75,"Natural disturbance dynamics in the boreal forests of European Russia: A review | In the European part of the Russian boreal zone the dynamics of pristine forests (taiga) has been studied by several generations of researchers. Many studies have examined the patterns and role of fire, windthrow, insect outbreaks and other natural disturbances. An attempt is made to provide a brief review of these studies. The reviewed studies show that lightning strikes were the only natural source of fires in taiga. The frequency of fires varied in various types of pristine landscape from 1-2 per century to 1-2 per millennium. Fires maintained a dynamic equilibrium between compositionally different forest communities or their certain ratio and areal occurrence. Fires favored the regeneration and recovery of pine forests and prevented the replacement of shade-intolerant species (e.g. pine) by shade-tolerant ones (e.g. spruce). Taiga forests generally displayed a mosaic pattern that varied from pioneer plant communities, growing in open burns, to climax communities that were extremely seldom affected by fire. The reviewed studies suggest that fires were a powerful ecological factor in pristine taiga, being largely responsible for the structure and spontaneous dynamics of forest communities. Windfalls were also common in pristine taiga landscapes and they regulated spontaneous dynamics in a gap-mosaic regime, which is most characteristic of spruce forests. | ['gromtsev'] | ",['gromtsev'],0

77,"Northern range limit mountain pine beetle outbreak dynamics in mixed sub-boreal pine forests of British Columbia | Recent widespread mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) (MPB) outbreaks in western North America have caused unprecedented tree mortality across much of the beetle's known historic range and into novel habitats near the range margins. Our current understanding of outbreak dynamics and their relationship to forest structure is based almost wholly on research from climatically optimal habitats where infestations have historically been most severe. As range expansion continues marginal habitats may become increasingly susceptible to outbreaks, yet little is known about the factors driving outbreak development in these forest types or how the disturbance regime differs. This study uses dendroecology and forest structure analysis to reconstruct historic outbreak dynamics at the northern MPB distribution limit in British Columbia to extend the disturbance record beyond the scope of documented history and to evaluate the long-term relationships between stand structure, host suitability, and regime characteristics at the range margin. We sampled 22 sites with evidence of past infestations, and using mortality dates, survivor growth releases, and tree vigor analyses we reconstructed five probable outbreak periods predating the current epidemic. At least two of these events fit the profile of large epidemics occurring in the 1900s-1910s and again in the 1940s-1950s, with evidence of two 19th century infestations and chronic localized mortality beginning around the 1980s. Stand age appears to be the most important factor limiting outbreaks prior to 1870, indicating a strong relationship with fire history at centennial time scales. Outbreak return intervals were comparable to those reported in other locations, yet beetle preference for larger and older trees suggests that provincial susceptibility models may not accurately represent northern outbreak risk, particularly in older stands. Following stand maturation, host availability does not appear to limit outbreak severity or recurrence. Here density-independent factors associated with additional climate pressures are likely more important. With enhanced climate suitability, outbreak scale and severity should increase dramatically in this landscape which is currently not limited by host distribution. Our reconstruction may inform management strategies as this occurs and outbreaks move into previously uninfested forests that share many structural and ecological similarities with our sites. | ['hrinkevich', 'lewis'] | ","['hrinkevich', 'lewis']",0
78,"One century of treeline change and stability - experiences from the Swedish scandes | This paper elaborates and visualizes processes recorded in a recent regional and multi-site study of elevational treeline dynamics during the period 1915 to 2007 in the Swedish Scandes. The purpose is to give a concrete face of the landscape transformation which is associated with the recorded treeline shifts. The main focus is on stand-level structure of past and present treelines and the advance zones, where climate change elicited responses by Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii, Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris. All species shifted their treelines upslope by a maximum of c. 200 m in elevation. Most sites, however, manifested changes of smaller magnitudes. This relates to topoclimatic constraints which decouple treeline performance from the macroclimate. The general character of sites which support large and small treeline shifts, respectively, are outlined. The spacing, age structure, growth rates of the tree advance zones are accounted for each of the concerned species. In temporal and spatial detail, the different tree species responded individualistically according to their specific ecologies. Current spread of young seedlings and saplings to increasingly higher elevations in the alpine tundra is particularly highlighted as it may represent the forefront of future treeline advance. It is argued that the current evolution of the treeline ecotone represents a fundamental, although not necessarily entirely unique, reversal of the long-term (Holocene) trend of neoglacial treeline descent. ¬© 2010 IALE-D. | ['kullman'] | ",['kullman'],0
79,"Origin and plant species diversity of high-altitude tundra summits across the boreal forest zone in eastern Canada | Many high-altitude summits across the boreal forest zone of Quebec are colonized by tundra vegetation. In this study, the origin and plant composition of these remote, isolated tundra summits have been documented to link their nature and floristic diversity to several potential causal factors. Analysis of spruce macrocharcoal pieces distributed at the soil surface indicates that wildfire is the chief factor behind the creation of the tundra summits across the boreal forest zone. All of the summits were deforested by fire during 2 main periods of the Holocene, around 100-500 cal y BP and 1150-1600 cal y BP. However, fire activity seems to have little influence on vegetation composition and diversity of post-fire tundra summits; latitudinal position and surface area are the main driving factors influencing floristic diversity. Given the remoteness of the sources of the arctic-alpine flora and young age of tundra summits associated with recent deforestation, only a small number of arctic-alpine species are colonizing the sites. Because of the regional dominance of boreal flora composed of common and widespread species adapted to nutrient-poor soils, it is probable that arctic-alpine species located on the tundra summits will go extinct in a warmer world promoting forest recovery. | ['payette', 'savard'] | ","['payette', 'savard']",1
80,"Palaeoecological study of the history of forest fires in eastern Finland | The forest structure, fire history and effects of fires on boreal forests in eastern Finland was studied using palaeoecological methods (charcoal and pollen analyses of lake sediments and examination of charcoal horizons in peat deposits). In addition, interpretation of charcoal records in lake sediments was examined. Attention primarily focused on periods representing natural dynamics of boreal forests, before significant human influence (slash-and-burn cultivation). The charcoal and pollen data suggest that fires occurred at an average interval of 70-110 years at studied sites prior to any significant human influence (local fire interval). Since it is improbable that each fire burned the whole lake catchment, the probable average fire return interval in natural boreal forests at sites on mineral soils may have been between 130 and 180 years. There seems to have been a similar fire interval at dry (Vaccinium type) and at mesic (Vaccinium myrtillus type) sites. Pollen evidence suggests a mixed coniferous forest structure with approximately equal proportion of spruce and pine for all studied sites prior to significant human influence. The average Picea pollen percentage values in sediments of studied lakes were, in general, stable from the establishment of Picea (about 6000 BP, cal.) to the beginning of cultivation. Therefore the fire rotation time was approximately the same during the whole period. However, climatic shifts probably affected temporarily fire rotation. During the slash-and-burn cultivation period when fire frequency increased considerably, the fire intolerant spruce decreased and the forest structure changed to a pine dominated type. Comparison of microscopic charcoal and dendrochronological data indicated that microscopic charcoal in lake sediments can record local burning at least in the case of low intensity fires. Since the macroscopic charcoal particles seem to be rare in many sediments and thus not reliable as a local fire indicator in all cases, it may be necessary to use a combined analysis of macroscopic and microscopic charcoal particles, supported by pollen analysis to detect local fires. The considerable variation in charcoal influxes between basins suggests that low resolution sediment charcoal records can provide only suggestive data of fire history and the records between sites can not be compared. For reconstruction of past fire regimes, resolution of single fires is necessary. Analysis of charcoal horizons of mires gave a conservative estimate of local fires, but because the mires burn only during especially dry conditions, the method provided no reliable material about forest fire frequency. In contrast, the shallow margins of mires at some sites may reliably record the number of fires in in situ, but may slightly underestimate forest fires. | ['pitkanen'] | ",['pitkanen'],0

We also evaluate trends in species abundance in a nemoral woodland in southern Scandinavia by comparing modelling results to palaeoecological data. 2 Simulated biomass trends for Picea, Pinus and Betula growing at Penningholmen (northern Sweden) are strikingly similar to those observed in the local pollen record, particularly in the replication of the early Little Ice Age (LIA) decline in Betula and the late-LIA dieback of Picea and Pinus. 3 LIA decreases in Betula may therefore be partly due to the effects of climate on its competitive interactions with Pinus, as well as the previously proposed effects of insect herbivory. 4 Simulations of Draved Forest (western Denmark), suggest that Tilia is under-represented in modern-day Scandinavian nemoral woodlands, and consequently that the present dominance of Fagus probably reflects strong human-plant interactions from as early as the beginning of the 17th century. 5 This study highlights the importance, despite general limitations associated with vegetation models, of model-data comparisons for understanding mechanisms and processes underlying past forest succession, and emphasizes the usefulness of forest models for reconstructing climate influences on past vegetation. | ['bradshaw', 'cowling', 'sykes'] | ","['bradshaw', 'cowling', 'sykes']",0
82,"A 700-year paleoecological record of boreal ecosystem responses to climatic variation from Alaska | Recent observations and model simulations have highlighted the sensitivity of the forest - tundra ecotone to climatic forcing. In contrast, paleoecological studies have not provided evidence of tree-line fluctuations in response to Holocene climatic changes in Alaska, suggesting that the forest - tundra boundary in certain areas may be relatively stable at multicentennial to millennial time scales. We conducted a multiproxy study of sediment cores from an Alaskan lake near the altitudinal limits of key boreal-forest species. Paleoecological data were compared with independent climatic reconstructions to assess ecosystem responses of the forest - tundra boundary to Little Ice Age (LIA) climatic. uctuations. Pollen, diatom, charcoal, macrofossil, and magnetic analyses provide the first continuous record of vegetation -. re - climate interactions at decadal to centennial time scales during the past 700 years from southern Alaska. Boreal-forest diebacks characterized by declines of Picea mariana, P. glauca, and tree Betula occurred during the LIA ( AD 1500 - 1800), whereas shrubs ( Alnus viridis, Betula glandulosa/nana) and herbaceous taxa (Epilobium, Aconitum) expanded. Marked increases in charcoal abundance and changes in magnetic properties suggest increases in. re importance and soil erosion during the same period. In addition, the conspicuous reduction or disappearance of certain aquatic ( e. g., Isoetes, Nuphar, Pediastrum) and wetland ( Sphagnum) plants and major shifts in diatom assemblages suggest pronounced lake-level. uctuations and rapid ecosystem reorganization in response to LIA climatic deterioration. Our results imply that temperature shifts of 1 - 2 degrees C, when accompanied by major changes in moisture balance, can greatly alter high-altitudinal terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystems, including conversion between boreal-forest tree line and tundra. The climatic and ecosystem variations in our study area appear to be coherent with changes in solar irradiance, suggesting that changes in solar activity contributed to the environmental instability of the past 700 years. | ['bigler', 'gedye', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'hu', 'jones', 'kaltenrieder', 'krahenbuehl', 'tinner'] | ","['bigler', 'gedye', 'gregory', 'eaves', 'hu', 'jones', 'kaltenrieder', 'krahenbuehl', 'tinner']",0

84,"A Postfire Shift from Lichen-Spruce to Lichen-Tundra Vegetation at Tree Line | The environmental changes associated with a fire-induced shift from old-growth lichen-spruce krummholz to lichen-tundra vegetation have been evaluated at a tree line site in northern Quebec [Canada]. Tree ring and growth form patterns of black spruce (Picea mariana) remains lysing on the ground in a lichen-tundra community were used to reconstruct, within a 4600-m2 quadrat, the structure of a conifer stand at the time of the burn (.apprxeq. AD 1750). The prefire spruces were the last members of a long regenerative sequence leading to maintenance of a lichen-spruce stand formed after a burn .apprxeq. 1700 yr BP. At this time postfire recruitment was most likely facilitated by favorable climatic conditions. Before the 1750 fire event the krummholz was predominantly maintained by layering, due to severe climatic conditions at least since the beginning of the Little Ice Age (.apprxeq. AD 1580). The site was deforested by the 1750 fire, because of the limited regenerative potential of stunted spruce. Postfire spruce exclusion has been responsible for major environmental changes associated with a thinner snow cover. Along the border of the deforested site snow cover depth was controlled by living spruces, whereas postfire shrubs (mostly dwarf birch, Betula glandulosa) of the lichen-tundra stand were unable to trap drifting snow. A significant decrease in thickness of the snow cover following deforestation was deduced from a comparative analysis of stem morphology of prefire spruces and present snow conditions. Inception of gelifluction lobes and mudboils was also caused by a change in the soil thermal regime associated with a reduced snow cover. Our results confirm the hypothesis that several lichen stands of the forest-tundra are postfire communities succeeding from degraded conifer stands during cold periods of the late Holocene. | ['arseneault', 'payette'] | ","['arseneault', 'payette']",1
85,"Potential role of vegetation feedback in the climate sensitivity of high-latitude regions: A case study at 6000 years BP | Previous climate model simulations have shown that the configuration of the Earth's orbit during the early to mid-Holocene (approximately 10-5 kyr) can account for the generally warmer-than-present conditions experienced by the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. New simulations for 6 kyr with two atmospheric/mixed-layer ocean models (Community Climate Model, version 1, CCM1, and Global ENvironmental and Ecological Simulation of Interactive Systems, version 2, GENESIS 2) are presented here and compared with results from two previous simulations with GENESIS 1 that were obtained with and without the albedo feedback due to climate-induced poleward expansion of the boreal forest. The climate model results are summarized in the form of potential vegetation maps obtained with the global BIOME model, which facilitates visual comparisons both among models and with pollen and plant macrofossil data recording shifts of the forest-tundra boundary. A preliminary synthesis shows that the forest limit was shifted 100-200 km north in most sectors. Both CCM1 and GENESIS 2 produced a shift of this magnitude. GENESIS 1 however produced too small a shift, except when the boreal forest albedo feedback was included. The feedback in this case was estimated to have amplified forest expansion by approximately 50%. The forest limit changes also show meridional patterns (greatest expansion in central Siberia and little or none in Alaska and Labrador) which have yet to be reproduced by models. Further progress in understanding of the processes involved in the response of climate and vegetation to orbital forcing will require both the deployment of coupled atmosphere-biosphere-ocean models and the development df more comprehensive observational data sets. | ['bartlein', 'foley', 'harrison', 'hostetler', 'kutzbach', 'liu', 'prentice', 'webb'] | ","['bartlein', 'foley', 'harrison', 'hostetler', 'kutzbach', 'liu', 'prentice', 'webb']",1
86,"Rapid response of treeline vegetation and lakes to past climate warming | Future greenhouse warming is expected to be particularly pronounced in boreal regions, and consequent changes in vegetation in these regions may in turn affect global climate. It is therefore important to establish how boreal ecosystems might respond to rapid changes in climate. Here we present palaeoecological evidence for changes in terrestrial vegetation and lake characteristics during an episode of climate warming that occurred between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago at the boreal treeline in central Canada. The intial transformation-from tundra to forest-tundra on land, which coincided with increases in lake productivity, pH and ratio of inflow to evaporation-took only 150 years, which is roughly equivalent to the time period often used in modelling the response of boreal forests to climate warming. The timing of the treeline advance did not coincide with the maximum in high-latitude summer insolation predicted by Milanovitch theory, suggesting that northern Canada experienced regionally asynchronous middle-to-late Holocene shifts in the summer position of the Arctic front. Such Holocene climate events may provide a better analogue for the impact of future global change on northern ecosystems than the transition from glacial to nonglacial conditions. | ['edward', 'macdonald', 'moser', 'pienitz', 'smol'] | ","['edward', 'macdonald', 'moser', 'pienitz', 'smol']",0
87,"Recent burning of boreal forests exceeds fire regime limits of the past 10,000 years | Wildfire activity in boreal forests is anticipated to increase dramatically, with far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences. Paleorecords are indispensible for elucidating boreal fire regime dynamics under changing climate, because fire return intervals and successional cycles in these ecosystems occur over decadal to centennial timescales. We present charcoal records from 14 lakes in the Yukon Flats of interior Alaska, one of the most flammable ecoregions of the boreal forest biome, to infer causes and consequences of fire regime change over the past 10,000 y. Strong correspondence between charcoal-inferred and observational fire records shows the fidelity of sedimentary charcoal records as archives of past fire regimes. Fire frequency and area burned increased similar to 6,000-3,000 y ago, probably as a result of elevated landscape flammability associated with increased Picea mariana in the regional vegetation. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; similar to 1,000-500 cal B.P.), the period most similar to recent decades, warm and dry climatic conditions resulted in peak biomass burning, but severe fires favored less-flammable deciduous vegetation, such that fire frequency remained relatively stationary. These results suggest that boreal forests can sustain high-severity fire regimes for centuries under warm and dry conditions, with vegetation feedbacks modulating climate-fire linkages. The apparent limit to MCA burning has been surpassed by the regional fire regime of recent decades, which is characterized by exceptionally high fire frequency and biomass burning. This extreme combination suggests a transition to a unique regime of unprecedented fire activity. However, vegetation dynamics similar to feedbacks that occurred during the MCA may stabilize the fire regime, despite additional warming. | ['brubaker', 'chipman', 'higuera', 'hu', 'kelly', 'stefanova'] | ","['brubaker', 'chipman', 'higuera', 'hu', 'kelly', 'stefanova']",1
88,"Recent fluctuations of the lichen-spruce forest limit in subarctic Quebec | 1 Black spruce (Picea mariana) experienced increased radial growth and stem height over the last 100 years at treeline in subarctic Quebec, suggesting warmer and snowier conditions. We tested if recent climate change also induced a shift from forest to krummholz during the Little Ice Age and stand reversion from krummholz to forest during the 1900s. Whether the shifts caused measurable displacements of the forest limit were also examined. 2 Growth forms of living and dead spruces were compared in five lichen-spruce stands located 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 km south of the krummholz limit. The age structure of supranival shoots (stems standing above the snow cover) at each site was also determined. 3 A reversion from lichen-spruce forest to krummholz probably occurred during the mid-1800s. Since the late 1800s, the forest limit moved 4 km northward most likely in response to milder winter conditions. Krummholz changed progressively to forest as spruce height and frequency of the tree growth form increased. Thus the northward advance of the forest limit resulted from structural changes of pre-established spruces, whereas there was no evidence for a recent spruce establishment in the tundra. | ['lavoie', 'payette'] | ","['lavoie', 'payette']",0
89,"Regional spread and stand-scale establishment of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies in Scandinavia | Palaeoecological studies are yielding fresh insights into slow forest ecosystem processes that are rarely observed using standard ecological methods, yet have major impacts on ecosystem function. Regional pollen data describe the broad features of the regional spread of trees but yield few insights into the processes of stand invasion and the facilitating role of disturbance. Pollen and charcoal data from small forest hollows are used to complement regional data in the study of the spread of Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica into southern Scandinavia during the last 4000 years. P. abies spread as a migrating front and preferentially invaded successional Betula stands, which had become particularly widespread in the region during the last 1000 years as a result of human activity. The spread of P. abies also closely tracked the changing area of suitable regional climate. The spread of F. sylvatica was more directly linked to anthropogenic activities and disturbance by fire prior to stand establishment. F. sylvatica preferentially invaded rich deciduous stand types that had declined in abundance during the last 2000 years. A recent range reduction of F. sylvatica can also be ascribed to human activity. The stand-scale palaeoecological data show how site conditions and disturbance are more important rate-limiting factors for F. sylvatica than for P. abies and help explain why F. sylvatica spread shows a patchy dynamic rather than the smoother migrating front of P. abies. | ['bradshaw', 'lindbladh'] | ","['bradshaw', 'lindbladh']",1
90,"Resilience of the boreal forest in response to Holocene fire-frequency changes assessed by pollen diversity and population dynamics | The hypothesis that changes in fire frequency control the long-term dynamics of boreal forests is tested on the basis of paleodata. Sites with different wildfire histories at the regional scale should exhibit different vegetation trajectories. Mean fire intervals and vegetation reconstructions are based respectively on sedimentary charcoal and pollen from two small lakes, one in the Mixedwood boreal forests and the second in the Coniferous boreal forests. The pollen-inferred vegetation exhibits different trajectories of boreal forest dynamics after afforestation, whereas mean fire intervals have no significant or a delayed impact on the pollen data, either in terms of diversity or trajectories. These boreal forests appear resilient to changes in fire regimes, although subtle modifications can be highlighted. Vegetation compositions have converged during the last 1200 years with the decrease in mean fire intervals, owing to an increasing abundance of boreal species at the southern site (Mixedwood), whereas changes are less pronounced at the northern site (Coniferous). Although wildfire is a natural property of boreal ecosystems, this study does not support the hypothesis that changes in mean fire intervals are the key process controlling long-term vegetation transformation. Fluctuations in mean fire intervals alone do not explain the historical and current distribution of vegetation, but they may have accelerated the climatic process of borealisation, likely resulting from orbital forcing. | ['ali', 'bergeron', 'carcaillet', 'frechette', 'richard'] | ","['ali', 'bergeron', 'carcaillet', 'frechette', 'richard']",1
91,"Resilience and sensitivity of ecosystem carbon stocks to fire-regime change in Alaskan tundra | Fire disturbance has increased in some tundra ecosystems due to anthropogenic climate change, with important ramifications for terrestrial carbon cycling. Assessment of the potential impact of fire-regime change on tundra carbon stocks requires long-term perspectives because tundra fires have been rare historically. Here we integrated the process-based Dynamic Organic Soil version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model with paleo-fire records to evaluate the responses of tundra carbon stocks to changes in fire return interval (FRI). Paleorecords reveal that mean FRIs of tundra ecosystems in Alaska ranged from centennial to millennial timescales (200‚Äì6000 years) during the late Quaternary, but projected FRIs by 2100 decrease to a few hundred years to several decades (70‚Äì660 years). Our simulations indicate threshold effects of changing FRIs on tundra carbon stocks. Shortening FRI from 5000 to 1000 years results in minimal carbon release (<5%) from Alaskan tundra ecosystems. Rapid carbon stock loss occurs when FRI declines below 800 years trigger sustained mobilization of ancient carbon stocks from permafrost soils. However, substantial spatial heterogeneity in the resilience/sensitivity of tundra carbon stocks to FRI change exists, largely attributable to vegetation types. We identified the carbon stocks in shrub tundra as the most vulnerable to decreasing FRI because shrub tundra stores a large share of carbon in combustible biomass and organic soils. Moreover, our results suggest that ecosystems characterized by large carbon stocks and relatively long FRIs (e.g. Brooks Foothills) may transition towards hotspots of permafrost carbon emission as a response to crossing FRI thresholds in the coming decades. These findings combined imply that fire disturbance may play an increasingly important role in future carbon balance of tundra ecosystems, but the net outcome may be strongly modulated by vegetation composition. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V. | ['chen', 'chipman', 'genet', 'hu', 'kelly', 'lara', 'mcguire'] | ","['chen', 'chipman', 'genet', 'hu', 'kelly', 'lara', 'mcguire']",0
92,"The role of climate, forest fires and human population size in Holocene vegetation dynamics in Fennoscandia | QuestionsWe investigated the changing role of climate, forest fires and human population size in the broad-scale compositional changes in Holocene vegetation dynamics before and after the onset of farming in Sweden (at 6,000cal yr BP) and in Finland (at 4,000calyr BP).LocationSouthern and central Sweden, SW and SE Finland.MethodsHolocene regional plant abundances were reconstructed using the REVEALS model on selected fossil pollen records from lakes. The relative importance of climate, fires and human population size on changes in vegetation composition was assessed using variation partitioning. Past climate variable was derived from the LOVECLIM climate model. Fire variable was reconstructed from sedimentary charcoal records. Estimated trend in human population size was based on the temporal distribution of archaeological radiocarbon dates.ResultsClimate explains the highest proportion of variation in vegetation composition during the whole study period in Sweden (10,000-4,000cal yr BP) and in Finland (10,000-1,000cal yr BP), and during the pre-agricultural period. In general, fires explain a relatively low proportion of variation. Human population size has significant effect on vegetation dynamics after the onset of farming and explains the highest variation in vegetation in S Sweden and SW Finland.ConclusionsMesolithic hunter-gatherer populations did not significantly affect vegetation composition in Fennoscandia, and climate was the main driver of changes at that time. Agricultural communities, however, had greater effect on vegetation dynamics, and the role of human population size became a more important factor during the late Holocene. Our results demonstrate that climate can be considered the main driver of long-term vegetation dynamics in Fennoscandia. However, in some regions the influence of human population size on Holocene vegetation changes exceeded that of climate and has a longevity dating to the early Neolithic. | ['alenius', 'edinborough', 'kuosmanen', 'marquer', 'molinari', 'pesonen', 'reitalu', 'renssen', 'seppa', 'tallavaara', 'trondman', 'zhang'] | ","['alenius', 'edinborough', 'kuosmanen', 'marquer', 'molinari', 'pesonen', 'reitalu', 'renssen', 'seppa', 'tallavaara', 'trondman', 'zhang']",0
93,"Saproxylic beetle assemblages in recently dead Scots pines: How traits modulate species' response to forest management? | Boreal forests have been intensively managed, influencing the spatiotemporal occurrence of dead wood, and leading to changes in saproxylic species assemblages. Some particular traits, such as habitat specialization, can be expected to make species sensitive to alterations in the amount, dynamics and heterogeneity of dead-wood habitats. We compared the saproxylic beetle assemblages of 320 dead standing Scots pines within 52 pine forest stands in three regions in Finland and Russia with contrasting forest-use history. We used the joint species distribution model of Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) to analyze how the beetle communities respond to alteration of forest structure. We applied scenario simulations to examine relationships between selected species traits and environmental gradients. Our results show that tree-level characteristics were the most important variables shaping the community composition in dead standing pines, but that also the characteristics of the forest stand as well as the larger-scale landscape context affected assemblage composition. Most importantly, managed forest stands and managed forest landscapes had lost species that are specialized in their resource use. The generalist species thriving in managed forest stands and managed forest landscapes were able to utilize dead wood of small diameter and man-made dead wood types, such as cut stumps and logging residues. We conclude that forest management not only reduces the amount of resources for saproxylic beetles locally, but has also landscape-level effects so that the most vulnerable species with specialized resource use and short-lived substrates can be lost also from remnant natural forest patches embedded in managed landscapes. | ['laaksonen', 'ovaskainen', 'punttila', 'siitonen'] | ","['laaksonen', 'ovaskainen', 'punttila', 'siitonen']",1

95,"Shifting altitudinal distribution of outbreak zones of winter moth Operophtera brumata in sub-arctic birch forest: A response to recent climate warming? | Climatic change is expected to affect the extent and severity of geometrid moth outbreaks, a major disturbance factor in sub-arctic birch forests. Previous studies have reported that the two geometrid species involved, autumnal moth and winter moth, differ in their temperature requirements and, consequently, in their altitudinal and latitudinal distribution patterns. In this study, we document the altitudinal distribution of winter moth outbreaks in a large coastal area in northern Norway. We show that, in the present winter moth outbreak, defoliated birch stands were seen as distinct zones with a rather constant width in the uppermost part of the forest and where the upper limit coincided with the forest line. The outbreak zone closely followed the spatially variable forest line as an undulating belt, although some of the variation in outbreak zone width was also related to variation in topographical variables, such as distance from the coast, forest line altitude, and slope of the terrain. A distinct outbreak zone at the altitudinal forest line is the typical picture that has been depicted in more qualitative historical records on previous outbreaks of autumnal moth rather than winter moth. We suggest that the recent documented climate warming in this region may have induced a shift in distribution of the winter moth both relative to topography and geography. Further investigation is, however, required to substantiate these suspicions. Copyright ¬© Ecography 2007. | ['hagen', 'ims', 'jepsen', 'yoccoz'] | ","['hagen', 'ims', 'jepsen', 'yoccoz']",1
96,"Shrub expansion in tundra ecosystems: dynamics, impacts and research priorities | Recent research using repeat photography, long-term ecological monitoring and dendrochronology has documented shrub expansion in arctic, high-latitude and alpine tundra ecosystems. Here, we (1) synthesize these findings, (2) present a conceptual framework that identifies mechanisms and constraints on shrub increase, (3) explore causes, feedbacks and implications of the increased shrub cover in tundra ecosystems, and (4) address potential lines of investigation for future research. Satellite observations from around the circumpolar Arctic, showing increased productivity, measured as changes in 'greenness', have coincided with a general rise in high-latitude air temperatures and have been partly attributed to increases in shrub cover. Studies indicate that warming temperatures, changes in snow cover, altered disturbance regimes as a result of permafrost thaw, tundra fires, and anthropogenic activities or changes in herbivory intensity are all contributing to observed changes in shrub abundance. A large-scale increase in shrub cover will change the structure of tundra ecosystems and alter energy fluxes, regional climate, soil-atmosphere exchange of water, carbon and nutrients, and ecological interactions between species. In order to project future rates of shrub expansion and understand the feedbacks to ecosystem and climate processes, future research should investigate the species or trait-specific responses of shrubs to climate change including: (1) the temperature sensitivity of shrub growth, (2) factors controlling the recruitment of new individuals, and (3) the relative influence of the positive and negative feedbacks involved in shrub expansion. | ['andreu', 'hayles', 'blok', 'boudreau', 'collier', 'elmendorf', 'epstein', 'forbes', 'goetz', 'grogan', 'hallinger', 'hermanutz', 'hik', 'lantz', 'levesque', 'macias', 'fauria', 'menard', 'myers', 'smith', 'ravolainen', 'rayback', 'rixen', 'ropars', 'rozema', 'sas', 'klaassen', 'schaepman', 'strub', 'schmidt', 'tape', 'trant', 'venn', 'weijers', 'welker', 'wilmking', 'wipf'] | ","['andreu', 'hayles', 'blok', 'boudreau', 'collier', 'elmendorf', 'epstein', 'forbes', 'goetz', 'grogan', 'hallinger', 'hermanutz', 'hik', 'lantz', 'levesque', 'macias', 'fauria', 'menard', 'myers', 'smith', 'ravolainen', 'rayback', 'rixen', 'ropars', 'rozema', 'sas', 'klaassen', 'schaepman', 'strub', 'schmidt', 'tape', 'trant', 'venn', 'weijers', 'welker', 'wilmking', 'wipf']",0
97,"Silvicultural models to maintain and restore natural stand structures in Swedish boreal forests | Almost all productive Swedish forests have been managed for timber production for a long period of time. More sensitive so-called red-listed species are today restricted to small remnant habitats in a managed landscape matrix. It has been hypothesized that natural biodiversity can be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, blends natural structures and includes natural composition into the production forest. The most important restoration measures in Swedish boreal forests for promoting biodiversity are to increase the number and quality of undisturbed forests, the amounts of coarse woody debris, the number of deciduous trees, and to introduce fire as an ecological process. On the basis of current knowledge of natural forest dynamics, we here present management options for three major site types in boreal Sweden which mimic natural dynamics better than traditional forestry. In the natural stages, the sites carried (1) Scots pine forest, (2) deciduous or Norway spruce dominated forest, and (3) Norway spruce forest regenerated by so-called gap dynamics, respectively. The flora and fauna that characterize the first two, fire-influenced sites are considered relatively well-adapted to the kind of large-scale disturbances characterizing forestry. On these sites, therefore, the modifications proposed are within today's approach to applying the clear felling system. Sites that seldom experience fire may host species extremely sensitive to large-scale disturbances. If such sites are to be used for timber production, modified forestry practices using selection or shelterwood systems with relatively dense shelterwoods are suggested.

99,"Spatiotemporal patterns of tundra fires: late-Quaternary charcoal records from Alaska | Anthropogenic climate change has altered many ecosystem processes in the Arctic tundra and may have resulted in unprecedented fire activity. Evaluating the significance of recent fires requires knowledge from the paleofire record because observational data in the Arctic span only several decades, much shorter than the natural fire rotation in Arctic tundra regions. Here we report results of charcoal analysis on lake sediments from four Alaskan lakes to infer the broad spatial and temporal patterns of tundra-fire occurrence over the past 35 000 years. Background charcoal accumulation rates are low in all records (range is 0-0.05 pieces cm(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting minimal biomass burning across our study areas. Charcoal peak analysis reveals that the mean fire-return interval (FRI; years between consecutive fire events) ranged from ca. 1650 to 6050 years at our sites, and that the most recent fire events occurred from ca. 880 to 7030 years ago, except for the CE 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire. These mean FRI estimates are longer than the fire rotation periods estimated for the past 63 years in the areas surrounding three of the four study lakes. This result suggests that the frequency of tundra burning was higher over the recent past compared to the late Quaternary in some tundra regions. However, the ranges of FRI estimates from our paleofire records overlap with the expected values based on fire-rotation-period estimates from the observational fire data, and the differences are statistically insignificant. Together with previous tundra-fire reconstructions, these data suggest that the rate of tundra burning was spatially variable and that fires were extremely rare in our study areas throughout the late Quaternary. Given the rarity of tundra burning over multiple millennia in our study areas and the pronounced effects of fire on tundra ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling, dramatic tundra ecosystem changes are expected if anthropogenic climate change leads to more frequent tundra fires. | ['chipman', 'duffy', 'higuera', 'hu', 'hudspith', 'kelly', 'oswald'] | ","['chipman', 'duffy', 'higuera', 'hu', 'hudspith', 'kelly', 'oswald']",2
100,"Stand dynamics, regeneration patterns and long-term continuity in boreal old-growth Picea abies swamp-forests | The occurrence of macrofossil charcoal (long axis gtoreq 0.5 mm) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) pollen in peat stratigraphies, in combination with size and age data from 2976 P. abies trees were used to analyse ecosystem continuity and stand-structure in ten old-growth swamp-forests in northern Sweden. All stands were dominated by P. abies, a species whose abundance increased westwards in Sweden between 3000 and 2000 yr B.P. In three stands no macrofossil charcoal was found and the maximum age of the peat, determined by 14C dating, varied from 1800 to 3600 yr B.P. In the other seven stands the number of levels containing charcoal varied from 1 to 23, but only between 1 and 7 levels were found after the appearance of spruce. Here the maximum age of the peat varied from 400 to 7900 yr B.P. The ten stands had an all-sized stand structure and a stand continuity of ca. 300 yr. The shape of the age structure was similar to an inverse J-curve. This indicates a continuous recruitment over time in a self-perpetuating ecosystem. In a short-term perspective ( lt 300 yr), the swamp-forests are characterized by individual trees continually emerging while others are dying. It is suggested that internal dynamics of continuous small-scale disturbances in combination with local site-specific factors determine the structure of these forests. In a long-term perspective, some of the present spruce swamp-forests within the northern boreal zone have functioned as true fire-free refugia since the establishment of P. abies populations while others have been affected by recurring fires, although not as frequently as forests on surrounding drier sites. The hypothesis that Scandinavian spruce swamp-forests in general have functioned as true long-term fire-free refugia is thus modified by the present results. | ['hornberg', 'ohlson', 'zackrisson'] | ","['hornberg', 'ohlson', 'zackrisson']",0

The acquired data provide indications of the effects of human activities on local vegetation during the settlement phase, and on ecological processes in both long-and short-term perspectives. The results show that one settlement site, Gieddealge, was established just above the forest line in the Betula treeline zone, and the other, Varenodjukke, in the Betula forest. At Gieddealge an increase in herbs and graminoids appears to have occurred c. 700 cal. BP (during the thirteenth century) suggesting that the vegetation was altered by nutrient addition, most likely related to human activities associated with the settlement. At Varenodjukke, the Betula trees around the settlement were cut down and the site developed into an alpine heath dominated by Betula nana, which still characterizes the site today. In the Reference area evidence of changes to the vegetation probably caused by human impact was also found from c. 3500 to 700 cal. BP. In conclusion, the vegetation currently present at Gieddealge and Varenodjukke has been strongly influenced by previous human activities, which have clearly had profound effects, both short and long term, on the composition of the vegetation and the properties of the ecosystems in these areas. Further, when studying processes, such as anticipated global warming that will influence future patterns of vegetation in these forest-line areas, legacies of land use must be taken into consideration. | ['hornberg', 'salmonsson', 'staland'] | ","['hornberg', 'salmonsson', 'staland']",0
105,"The Transformation of a Norway Spruce Dominated Landscape Since Pre-Industrial Times in Northern Sweden: the Influence of Modern Forest Management on Forest Structure | Logging history and the study of reference conditions in Scandinavian boreal forests has tended to focus on Scots pine dominated ecosystems. This paper presents a regional study of pre-industrial forest conditions and examines the effects of the industrial exploitation of ecosystems dominated by Not-way spruce in northern Sweden. Historical records covering a period which preceded industrial logging in the study area (1917-1927) were used to obtain quantitative data on forest structure and influence of forest fires. These data were compared with a modern data set (2003) to analyse changes due to the industrial transformation of the forest. The early 20th century landscape was dominated by old, multi-cohorted spruce forests and mixed coniferous forests. It was found that fire affected both the structure and composition of the landscape. In post-burnt areas, even-aged forests dominated by deciduous species were the principal forest type. Between the early and modern data sets, profound changes in tree-species composition and age structure were documented. While the total volume of deciduous species increased substantially, the coverage of forests dominated by deciduous species decreased. There was also a significant increase in pine-dominated forests and in the total volume of pine. The industrial transformation of the studied landscapes has had profound effects oil the structure of spruce forests, but much less so oil deciduous forests. The study concludes that the present forest structure is a function of past management regimes, and that future transformations of the landscape will continue, thus affecting the natural variability and biodiversity of the forests. | ['hellberg', 'josefsson', 'ostlund'] | ","['hellberg', 'josefsson', 'ostlund']",2
106,"The transient response of ecosystems to climate change is amplified by trophic interactions | Studies of ecosystem responses to climate change often focus on potential equilibria in species or community distributions, overlooking the transitions to new equilibrium states. Transient phases can however last for decades or centuries, during which both demography and interspecific interactions are expected to play a crucial role. Here, we investigate the response of vegetation to climate warming at high latitudes involving a shift from open vegetation to either boreal (mainly coniferous) or temperate (mainly deciduous) forests. We specifically address how interactions among browsers and vegetation could affect the shift in dominance of vegetation type after climate warming. We characterize the transient dynamics using five measures: 1) asymptotic resilience, i.e. the rate at which equilibrium is restored, 2) initial resilience, the short-term rate of change of the ecosystem after climate change, 3) ecosystem exposure, i.e. the shift of the equilibrium due to climate change, 4) sensitivity, or the time to recover equilibrium, and 5) vulnerability, measured as the cumulative amount of changes in vegetation states during the transient phase. We find that plant‚Äìherbivore interactions usually extend the length of the transient period and induce more cumulative changes in vegetation types. This result implies that the consideration of multiple interacting species is necessary to provide robust scenarios of how ecosystems will respond to global changes. We furthermore show that plant‚Äìherbivore interactions disrupt the correlation between the five measures characterizing the transient dynamics, highlighting the need for a full multidimensional characterization of transients. ¬© 2018 The Authors | ['boulangeat', 'daufresne', 'gravel', 'leblond', 'svenning'] | ","['boulangeat', 'daufresne', 'gravel', 'leblond', 'svenning']",1
107,"Tree mortality episodes in the intact Picea abies-dominated taiga in the Arkhangelsk region of northern European Russia | QuestionWhat were the temporal patterns and rates of tree mortality in a recent episodic tree mortality event? Have similar events occurred in the past, and does climatic variability play a role in the disturbance regime?LocationIntact Picea abies-dominated taiga in the Arkhangelsk region, northwestern Russia.MethodsWe reconstructed the past tree mortality and disturbance history by applying dendroecological methods in five forest stands and related these to climatic data. The role of other potential causes of tree mortality was assessed in a field inventory.ResultsThe recent episode lasted from 1999 to 2004, influenced all stands studied, and killed on average 21% of trees with a diameter of over 10 cm at 1.3-m height. The annual tree mortality rate in the decades preceding this episode was 0.49%. During the past 200 years, the stands have experienced chronic small-scale disturbances, with several irregular disturbances of moderate severity. The recent episode was associated with abundant signs of the bark beetle Ips typographus. Furthermore, the timing of both the recent tree mortality episode and the past disturbance events was associated with dry summers.ConclusionThe results indicate a connection between climatic variability and forest dynamics, the likely driving factors being droughts and bark beetles. In the context of the past 200 years, the recent episode was potentially at the higher end of the range of disturbance variability in terms of severity and spatial extent. This has ecological implications in a changing climate, potentially influencing ecosystem structure and long-term dynamics. | ['aakala', 'kauhanen', 'kuuluvainen', 'wallenius'] | ","['aakala', 'kauhanen', 'kuuluvainen', 'wallenius']",1
108,"Tundra arthropods provide key insights into ecological responses to environmental change | Arthropods perform critically important functions in food webs and ecosystems and are highly sensitive to the effects of environmental change. Despite their importance, the knowledge gaps in arthropod ecology are substantial. This is particularly problematic in Earth's polar and alpine regions, where tundra ecosystems are responding rapidly to climate change. Species diversity is lower in these regions versus temperate and tropical regions, but (1) we lack baseline and long-term data about the distributions and abundances of arthropods and their relationships to abiotic variation and (2) the roles of arthropods in these ecosystems are far from fully described. In recognition of the need for increased tundra arthropod research activity, a group of international scientists formed the Network for Arthropods of the Tundra (NeAT). In the past 3 years, this academic network has brought together entomologists from research institutions around the world to revitalize and coordinate the study of tundra arthropods. This special issue on the ecology of tundra arthropods represents a tangible example of this increased momentum. The papers in the special issue highlight recent advances in understanding the relationships between arthropod communities and abiotic variation in tundra ecosystems and clarify the roles that arthropods play in ecosystems. They collectively demonstrate the utility of tundra arthropods as a model system for testing general ecological theory about how species respond to environmental variation. We hope this special issue with the insights it provides and the new frontiers it outlines, together with NeAT, will leverage further momentum to the interest in, and study of the ecology of tundra arthropods in the years to come. | ['culler', 'hoye'] | ","['culler', 'hoye']",0
109,"Tundra in a Changing Climate | Both palaeogeographical reconstructions and general circulation models indicate that global warming is especially strongly manifested in high latitudes. Under a 2¬∞C increase in mean global temperature, almost the entire modern tundra zone would become potentially suitable for tree growth. Nevertheless, palaeobotanic data cannot be applied directly to estimating vegetation response to the global warming expected in the 21st century, as they characterize a quasi-equilibrium state of ecosystems, which takes several centuries to be achieved. Low migration rates of trees, damage caused by fires and insects, processes of soil drying or paludification, and influence of herbivorous animals and human activities may slow down considerably forest spread in tundra. Climate warming will probably cause a decline in the populations of Arctic species and expansion of ranges of some southern animal species into the Arctic. | ['borisova', 'callaghan', 'velichko'] | ","['borisova', 'callaghan', 'velichko']",1
110,"Tussocks Enduring or Shrubs Greening: Alternate Responses to Changing Fire Regimes in the Noatak River Valley, Alaska | As the Arctic warms, tundra wildfires are expected to become more frequent and severe. Assessing how the most flammable regions of the tundra respond to burning can inform us about how the rest of the Arctic may be affected by climate change. Here we describe ecosystem responses to tundra fires in the Noatak River watershed of northwestern Alaska using shrub dendrochronology, active-layer depth monitoring, and remotely sensed vegetation productivity. Results show that relatively productive tundra is more likely to experience fires and to burn more severely, suggesting that fuel loads currently limit tundra fire distribution in the Noatak Valley. Within three years of burning, most alder shrubs sampled had either germinated or resprouted, and vegetation productivity inside 60 burn perimeters had recovered to prefire values. Tundra fires resulted in two phases of increased primary productivity as manifested by increased landscape greening. Phase one occurred in most burned areas 3-10 years after fires, and phase two occurred 16-44 years after fire at sites where tundra fires triggered near-surface permafrost thaw resulting in shrub proliferation. A fire-shrub-greening positive feedback is currently operating in the Noatak Valley and this feedback could expand northward as air temperatures, fire frequencies, and permafrost degradation increase. This feedback will not occur at all locations. In the Noatak Valley, the fire-shrub-greening process is relatively limited in tussock tundra communities, where low-severity fires and shallow active layers exclude shrub proliferation. Climate warming and enhanced fire occurrence will likely shift fire-poor landscapes into either the tussock tundra or erect-shrub-tundra ecological attractor states that now dominate the fire-rich Noatak Valley. | ['andreu', 'hayles', 'berner', 'darrigo', 'gaglioti', 'goetz', 'jones', 'mann', 'orndahl', 'williams'] | ","['andreu', 'hayles', 'berner', 'darrigo', 'gaglioti', 'goetz', 'jones', 'mann', 'orndahl', 'williams']",2

112,"Vegetation and climate history of Quebec's mixed boreal forest suggests greater abundance of temperate species during the early- and mid-Holocene | Today, scattered disjunct stands of two temperate species, yellow birch and white pine, are present north of their continuous distributional range in southern Quebec (Canada) at topographical locations that offer protection from severe fires. This study tested whether these species had populations more numerous and widespread millennia ago when the climate was presumably warmer. Specifically, this research involved the analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils, and charcoal fragments of two sites within the western part of Quebec's balsam fir - paper birch bioclimatic domain: a forest humus deposit from a yellow birch stand (local scale), and a peatland (regional scale). Fossil data suggest that white pine was more abundant regionally between 7500 and 5000 cal. BP, before coming rare under subsequent cooler conditions. Likewise, yellow birch was more abundant regionally between 7700 and 1500 cal BP. Its subsequent decline and the local disappearance of white pine by similar to 200 cal. BP may both be explained by the severe fires that occurred in recent centuries, as well as the rarity of suitable habitats for these species. The sustained presence of temperate species in mixed boreal forests is the result of the combined action of climate, natural disturbances and habitat characteristics. | ['couillard', 'grondin', 'larochelle', 'lavoie'] | ","['couillard', 'grondin', 'larochelle', 'lavoie']",1
113,"Vegetation Development Following Fire in Picea-Mariana Black Spruce Pleurozium Forests of Southeastern Labrador Canada | The pattern of post-fire vegetation development in P. mariana (black Spruce)- Pleurozium forests in southeastern Labrador, Canada, is evaluated using paleoecological methods and vegetation analysis of extant stands. Macrofossil analysis of mor humus profiles in mature stands yields the following stratigraphy: mineral soil-charcoal-Polytrichum juniperinum-Cladonia lichens-Pleurozium schreberi-feather mosses and Sphagnum girgensohnii. The stratigraphic record of the post-fire dynamics of the vegetation at individual sites strengthens the conclusions obtained from the detailed analysis of chronosequence of stands. The patterns of vegetation development, especially of the arboreal species, is significantly different from the reported for the central and western boreal forest in North America. This difference is attributed to the much longer fire cycle in the maritime region of Labrador which allows the accumulation of a thick organic soil layer that is incompletely removed by fire. Arboreal regernation is slow due to the limited availability of mineral soil seedbeds. The progressive establishment of black spruce and balsam fir over a 70-100 yr period results in an uneven age structure and provides a long period when lichen woodlands cover the landscape. The majority of the vascular understorey species follow the pattern of initial floristics and resprout rapidly following fire. Coptis groenlandicum, Gaultheria hispidula, and Empetrum nigrum decrease following fire whereas only Epilobium angustifolium shows a marked increase. The cryptogam ground cover undergoes a physiognomic and compositional succession that represents contrasting substrate requirements and the differential response of the major species to a temporally-varying enviroment. | ['foster'] | ",['foster'],0
114,"Holocene vegetation dynamics and hydrological variability in forested peatlands of the Clay Belt, eastern Canada, reconstructed using a palaeoecological approach | Forested peatlands are widespread in boreal regions of Canada, and these ecosystems, which are major terrestrial carbon sinks, are undergoing significant transformations linked to climate change, fires and human activities. This study targets millennial-scale vegetation dynamics and related hydrological variability in forested peatlands of the Clay Belt south of James Bay, eastern Canada, using palaeoecological data. Changes in peatland vegetation communities were reconstructed using plant macrofossil analyses, and variations in water-table depths were inferred using testate amoeba analyses. High-resolution analyses of macroscopic charcoal >0.5 mm were used to reconstruct local fire history. Our data showed two successional pathways towards the development of present-day forested peatlands influenced by autogenic processes such as vertical peat growth and related drying, and allogenic factors such as the occurrence of local fires. The oldest documented peatland initiated in a wet rich fen around 8000 cal. a BP shortly after land emergence and transformed into a drier forested bog rapidly after peat inception that persisted over millennia. In the second site, peat started to accumulate from similar to 5200 cal. a BP over a mesic coniferous forest that shifted into a wet forested peatland following a fire that partially consumed the organic layer similar to 4600 cal. a BP. The charcoal records show that fires rarely occurred in these peatlands, but they have favoured the process of forest paludification and influenced successional trajectories over millennia. The macrofossil data suggest that Picea mariana (black spruce) persisted on the peatlands throughout their development, although there were periods of more open canopy due to local fires in some cases. This study brings new understanding on the natural variability of boreal forested peatlands which may help predict their response to future changes in climate, fire regimes and anthropogenic disturbances. | ['bergeron', 'fenton', 'garneau', 'grondin', 'le', 'stum', 'boivin', 'magnan'] | ","['bergeron', 'fenton', 'garneau', 'grondin', 'le', 'stum', 'boivin', 'magnan']",0
115,"Vegetation limits the impact of a warm climate on boreal wildfires | Strategic introduction of less flammable broadleaf vegetation into landscapes was suggested as a management strategy for decreasing the risk of boreal wildfires projected under climatic change. However, the realization and strength of this offsetting effect in an actual environment remain to be demonstrated.Here we combined paleoecological data, global climate models and wildfire modelling to assess regional fire frequency (RegFF, i.e. the number of fires through time) in boreal forests as it relates to tree species composition and climate over millennial time-scales.Lacustrine charcoals from northern landscapes of eastern boreal Canada indicate that RegFF during the mid-Holocene (6000-3000 yr ago) was significantly higher than pre-industrial RegFF (AD c. 1750). In southern landscapes, RegFF was not significantly higher than the pre-industrial RegFF in spite of the declining drought severity. The modelling experiment indicates that the high fire risk brought about by a warmer and drier climate in the south during the mid-Holocene was offset by a higher broadleaf component.Our data highlight an important function for broadleaf vegetation in determining boreal RegFF in a warmer climate. We estimate that its feedback may be large enough to offset the projected climate change impacts on drought conditions. | ['ali', 'bergeron', 'blarquez', 'carcaillet', 'genries', 'girardin', 'hely', 'terrier'] | ","['ali', 'bergeron', 'blarquez', 'carcaillet', 'genries', 'girardin', 'hely', 'terrier']",1
116,"A Warmer and Greener Cold World: Summer Warming Increases Shrub Growth in the Alpine and High Arctic Tundra | The Arctic and alpine biome is rapidly warming, which might be causing an encroachment of relatively tall woody shrub vegetation into tundra ecosystems, which will probably result in an overall positive feedback to climate warming. This encroachment is, however, believed to remain limited to the relatively warm parts of the biome, where taller shrubs may displace shorter species. Still, climate sensitivity of shrub growth strongly differs between species and sites and High Arctic dwarf shrub species may respond rapidly to increasing temperatures in absence of taller species. In addition, it remains largely unknown whether shrubs from different functional groups from the same sites respond similarly to climate drivers. In the present study we examined the climate-growth relationships of six different site-species combinations: one evergreen and one deciduous shrub species at two alpine sites, and one evergreen dwarf shrub species at two High Arctic sites. We compared linear mixed models for each combination, explaining existing shrub growth data with site-specific interpolated monthly and seasonal climate data from the gridded meteorological dataset CRU TS4.00. Shrub growth rates were found to be sensitive to summer climate for all species at all sites. Continued and projected warming is thus likely to stimulate a further encroachment of shrubs in these systems, at least through a densification of existing stands. Dwarf shrub growth strongly responded to the recent warming at both High Arctic sites, contrasting with previous work suggesting that shrub expansion might remain limited to warmer tundra regions. At the alpine sites, growth of evergreen shrubs was found to be more dependent on summer climate than growth of deciduous shrubs, perhaps because these evergreen species are less prone to herbivory. However, biome-wide generalizations at the functional group level may be difficult to interpolate to the species level. Micro-site conditions, such as the determination of growing season length and winter soil temperatures, and influence on growing season soil moisture by snow depth, may determine the strength of the climate-growth relationships found. | ['loffler', 'myers', 'smith', 'weijers'] | ","['loffler', 'myers', 'smith', 'weijers']",0
117,"Wetland succession in a permafrost collapse: interactions between fire and thermokarst | To determine the influence of fire and thermokarst in a boreal landscape, we investigated peat cores within and adjacent to a permafrost collapse feature on the Tanana River Floodplain of Interior Alaska. Radioisotope dating, diatom assemblages, plant macrofossils, charcoal fragments, and carbon and nitrogen content of the peat profile indicate similar to 600 years of vegetation succession with a transition from a terrestrial forest to a sedge-dominated wetland over 100 years ago, and to a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in approximately 1970. The shift from sedge to Sphagnum, and a decrease in the detrended tree-ring width index of black spruce trees adjacent to the collapse coincided with an increase in the growing season temperature record from Fairbanks. This concurrent wetland succession and reduced growth of black spruce trees indicates a step-wise ecosystem-level response to a change in regional climate. In 2001, fire was observed coincident with permafrost collapse and resulted in lateral expansion of the peatland. These observations and the peat profile suggest that future warming and/or increased fire disturbance could promote permafrost degradation, peatland expansion, and increase carbon storage across this landscape; however, the development of drought conditions could reduce the success of both black spruce and Sphagnum, and potentially decrease the long-term ecosystem carbon storage. | ['chapin', 'iii', 'fuller', 'harden', 'mcguire', 'myers', 'smith', 'wilmking'] | ","['chapin', 'iii', 'fuller', 'harden', 'mcguire', 'myers', 'smith', 'wilmking']",1
118,"Wildfire history of the boreal forest of south-western Yakutia (Siberia) over the last two millennia documented by a lake-sediment charcoal record | Wildfires, as a key disturbance in forest ecosystems, are shaping the world's boreal landscapes. Changes in fire regimes are closely linked to a wide array of environmental factors, such as vegetation composition, climate change, and human activity. Arctic and boreal regions and, in particular, Siberian boreal forests are experiencing rising air and ground temperatures with the subsequent degradation of permafrost soils leading to shifts in tree cover and species composition. Compared to the boreal zones of North America or Europe, little is known about how such environmental changes might influence long-term fire regimes in Russia. The larch-dominated eastern Siberian deciduous boreal forests differ markedly from the composition of other boreal forests, yet data about past fire regimes remain sparse. Here, we present a high-resolution macroscopic charcoal record from lacustrine sediments of Lake Khamra (southwest Yakutia, Siberia) spanning the last ca. 2200 years, including information about charcoal particle sizes and morphotypes. Our results reveal a phase of increased charcoal accumulation between 600 and 900 CE, indicative of relatively high amounts of burnt biomass and high fire frequencies. This is followed by an almost 900-year-long period of low charcoal accumulation without significant peaks likely corresponding to cooler climate conditions. After 1750 CE fire frequencies and the relative amount of biomass burnt start to increase again, coinciding with a warming climate and increased anthropogenic land development after Russian colonization. In the 20th century, total charcoal accumulation decreases again to very low levels despite higher fire frequency, potentially reflecting a change in fire management strategies and/or a shift of the fire regime towards more frequent but smaller fires. A similar pattern for different charcoal morphotypes and comparison to a pollen and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) record from the same sediment core indicate that broad-scale changes in vegetation composition were probably not a major driver of recorded fire regime changes. Instead, the fire regime of the last two millennia at Lake Khamra seems to be controlled mainly by a combination of short-term climate variability and anthropogenic fire ignition and suppression. | ['andreev', 'biskaborn', 'dietze', 'gluckler', 'herzschuh', 'kruse', 'pestryakova', 'vyse', 'winkler'] | ","['andreev', 'biskaborn', 'dietze', 'gluckler', 'herzschuh', 'kruse', 'pestryakova', 'vyse', 'winkler']",0
119,"Wildland Fire: Understanding and Maintaining an Ecological Baseline | The goal was to synthesize the literature on wildland fires, how they create resilient landscape mosaics that affect ecosystem function and maintenance of biodiversity, and how the fires themselves are affected by wilderness edge effects and climate change. The emphasis is on cold-temperate and boreal forests. The interactions of fires with landforms create large-magnitude spatial and temporal heterogeneity in fire severity that cannot be seen in smaller natural areas. Patterns of live and dead biomass and characteristic syndromes of fire-species interactions determine future successional trajectories and spatial-temporal dynamics of landscape mosaics. Therefore, wildlands with freely occurring fires provide a scientific baseline for complexity of vegetation structure and maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem processes on time scales from years to centuries and millennia. Although wildlands are impacted by climate change, they may have considerable resilience, partly due to fire occurrence, and may still serve as a moving baseline. Thus, the patterns observed in wildlands can be used as blueprints for restoration of landscape structure, biodiversity, and ecosystem function in human-dominated ecosystems. Wildland fires play an important role in maintenance of ecological function and biodiversity, even on landscapes where fire is considered to be rare. At time scales of centuries, fires in large wilderness areas maintain a balance among successional stages, and although early and late-successional stages are rarely absent, their occurrences change in space and time, possibly leading to metapopulation dynamics for species that depend on certain successional stages. Over thousands of years, fires influence the trajectory of ecosystem retrogression, and in cold climates, fires can prevent ecosystem acidification that reduces forest productivity. Fire regimes within large wildlands are subject to change caused by fragmentation effects at large spatial extents; this can result in increased or reduced fire frequencies (disturbance dilution effect) within wildlands. Wildland managers need to think about how changes in the surrounding landscape influence the integrity of the natural disturbance baseline, while forest managers need to think about how harvesting compares to the baseline with respect to maintenance of productivity and biodiversity. | ['frelich'] | ",['frelich'],1

Peat accumulation on the Kola Peninsula started at c. 8500-7500 BP. Pinus sylvestris reached its present northern limit on the peninsula by 7000 BP, while 6000-5000/4500 BP was a time of maximal progress of birch forest tundra up to the Barents Sea shoreline. Alnus incana grew up to the Rybachiy Peninsula c. 40 km north of its present-day northern limit. By c. 5500/5300 BP Picea obovata had immigrated to the Khibiny mountains. After 5000/4500 BP the forested area had retreated in the northern part of the Kola Peninsula and the tundra belt bordering the Barents Sea shore was formed. By 3500 BP spruce had reached its modern northern limit. | ['cherkinsky', 'goriachkin', 'kremenetski', 'sulerzhitsky', 'vaschalova'] | ","['cherkinsky', 'goriachkin', 'kremenetski', 'sulerzhitsky', 'vaschalova']",2
